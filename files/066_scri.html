<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LECTURE HALL - AFTERNOON 
      (DAY)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The last rays of the afternoon sun pour into 
      the class, blacklighting the students and washing Maggie's face in rich 
      amber as she speaks. Buffy sits near the front, by Willow. Riley stands to 
      one side of the class.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAGGIE<br/>So this is what it 
      is.<br/>Talking about communication,<br/>talking about language.<br/>Not the 
      same thing. It's<br/>about the way a child can<br/>recognize and 
      produce<br/>phonemes that don't occur<br/>in its native language.<br/>It's 
      about inspiration,<br/>not the idea but the moment<br/>before the idea when 
      it's<br/>total, when it blossoms in<br/>your mind and connects 
      to<br/>everything, before the<br/>coherent thought that<br/>gives it shape, 
      that locks<br/>it in and cuts it off from<br/>the universal. When you 
      can<br/>articulate it, it becomes<br/>smaller. It's about thoughts<br/>and 
      experiences that we don't<br/>have a word for. A demonstration.<br/>Buffy 
      Summers.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks around her. Me?</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAGGIE <br/>Thank you for 
      volunteering.<br/>Come down to the front here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Hesitantly, Buffy does. Stands by 
      Maggie.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAGGIE <br/>Typical college girl, one 
      assumes.<br/>Lie down on my desk.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAGGIE<br/>Go ahead. You're perfectly 
      safe.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy does, pretty embarrassed. Some titters 
      from the class. She lies on her back, propped up on her elbows and waiting 
      for the next thing.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAGGIE <br/>Riley. If you could 
      oblige?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley moves from his spot on the side. He 
      seems quietly angry at Maggie as he says:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>A demonstration, 
      right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAGGIE<br/>Be a good 
boy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He moves around to the back of the desk, 
      stands by Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAGGIE <br/>(to the class)<br/>A kiss is 
      just a kiss,<br/>I believe the line goes.<br/>The rest comes from 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Riley look at each other, speak 
      softly:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>This feels very 
      strange.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Don't worry. If I kiss 
      you,<br/>it'll make the sun go down.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He takes her in his arms and in front of a 
      sea of ogling students, they kiss.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON: BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As the kiss depends, the light changes. The 
      sun is going down. As she pulls away, it is dark, moonlight the only 
      illumination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WIDE ANGLE: THE CLASS is empty. Just her and 
      Riley.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY <br/>See?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Fortune favors the 
      brave...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She stands as he looks about them. He turns 
      to her -- and she puts her hand up. Did she hear something?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Very faintly, it can be made out: A little 
      girl, humming tunelessly to herself.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY <br/>Do you hear 
      that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She heads out of class, slowly. Riley 
      watches her go, smiles as he whispers to himself.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Along came a 
      spider...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL ATRIUM/HALL - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy moves slowly through the atrium toward 
      the hall, led by the humming, which becomes a nursery rhyme:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">LITTLE GIRL<br/>Can't even 
      shout.<br/>Can't even cry.<br/>The Gentlemen are coming by.<br/>Looking in 
      windows,<br/>knocking on doors...<br/>They need to take seven<br/>and they 
      might take yours...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy turns the corner and sees the girl 
      standing facing her at the other end of the hall.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON: THE GIRL'S HANDS. In them is a 
      small box, perfectly square, carved wood.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">LITTLE GIRL <br/>Can't call to 
      mom.<br/>Can't say a word.<br/>You're gonna die screaming<br/>but you won't 
      be heard.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley comes out as well, a worried 
      expression on his face. He comes to Buffy, reaches silently out to 
      her...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks back -- at a Hideous grinning 
      white face that we see for an INSTANT before</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LECTURE HALL - AFTERNOON</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy wakes with a start.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAGGIE<br/>So I'll see you all 
      Monday<br/>for a final review session.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The class bustles about, getting their stuff 
      together and filing out as Buffy gets her bearings. The light is different 
      than in her dream - - just the nondescript glow of the overheads. A 
      comforting space.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow is putting her books away.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Boy, that was an exciting 
      class, huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh yeah. Wow.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>And that last twenty minutes 
      --<br/>it was a revelation. Just laid<br/>out everything we needed to 
      know<br/>for the final. I'd hate to have<br/>missed that.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Just tell me I didn't 
      snore.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(smiles)<br/>You were very 
      discreet.<br/>Minimal drool.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh, yay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They head out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL ATRIUM/HALL - CONTINUING 
      (AFTERNOON)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They round the corner heading out of 
      class:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>So, were you 
      dreaming?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah, it was kind of 
      intense...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They pass Riley without seeing him. He folds 
      in behind them, offering:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Intense? Really?<br/>â€˜Cause you 
      seemed so peaceful.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(embarrassed)<br/>Of course it 
      was only<br/>for a moment that --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Right. You guys 
      headed<br/>toward Kresge?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Student 
center.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Great. So this 
      dream.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow stops, deciding to leave them 
      alone.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You know, you guys go,<br/>I'm 
      gonna do the thing.<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>I'll see you after the Wicca 
      group.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>â€˜kay</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Bye..</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Buffy and Riley continue, we stay on 
      Willow, who sneaks over to the arched window from the atrium to the hall 
      to peek out at them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY (O.S.)<br/>So, tell me about your 
      dream.<br/>As a psych major I'm qualified<br/>to go "Hmmmm".</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>I don't remember it 
      all...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We pan to find them rounding the corner and 
      heading down the hall toward camera --</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Well, did I appear<br/>at all 
      in this dream?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(smiling)<br/>There may have 
      been a cameo...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Is that right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And they pass the arched window, where 
      Willow is very subtly holding a book in front of her face.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>A featured role, 
      actually.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm not saying any 
      more.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As they pass out of frame Willow drops the 
      book, looking out after them with satisfaction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. PSYCH BUILDING - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A few moments later, as the two of them exit 
      and head up the path:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>So what have you<br/>got going 
      on tonight?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(quick cover)<br/>Uh, 
      petroleum.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Petroleum.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Uh huh.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Tonight you have crude 
      oil.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And homework. What about 
      you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Oh, you know, grading 
      papers...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well, that'll be 
      fun.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Not "petroleum" fun,<br/>but it 
      passes the time...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The stop by the wall, about to slip 
      up.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>So I'll...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I guess I won't see you 
      till...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They are close, leaning subtly in... could 
      be a kiss...</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY <br/>What papers?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Papers?</font></center>

<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The moment is blown. They part, each

      Willow goes to her, breathing hard, what do they do? They're both

      concern.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. XANDER'S BASEMENT - MORNING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander stands up into frame, having the 
      exact same problem, contorting his mouth in an effort to get sound 
      out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike is doing a much more civilized and 
      calm version of same.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander stops. He points at Spike -- 
      J'accuse! Spike looks at him. Me?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander realizes that's idiotic. Thinks. 
      Rushes to the phone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy reenters as the phone rings, passing

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley lies in bed in the dark as Forrest 
      throws the door open, moves to wake him. Riley comes to instantly, sits

      --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He stops, tries to talk, clears his throat 
      -- the by now familiar response. Forrest shakes him, points to his own 
      throat. Points outside: the rest of the house as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley reaches for his pants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LOWELL HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER - 
      MORNING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley is pulling his shirt on as he exits 
      his bedroom, Forrest with him, Another guy is coming down the second floor 
      stairs, looking confused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley and Forrest go down the steps to the 
      ground floor at a good clip. There are maybe five guys there, confused, 
      awaiting orders of anything that makes sense.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley signals for them to wait there as he 
      and Forrest proceed to the elevator.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They stand before the mirror, let the green 
      light wash over them. The voice says:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ELEVATOR VOICE (V.O.)<br/>Retinal scan 
      accepted.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They react to the sound of a voice as the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The door shuts behind them and they go down, 
      Forrest scribbling something on a notepad.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest holds the pad out to Riley. He has 
      written: "IT'S ALL OVER TOWN."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The two look plenty concerned. Then the 
      elevator stops.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As the voice is speaking, Riley bangs on a 
      panel, pops it open. There is a keypad and wires there. Riley pulls a card 
      from his back pocket, inserts it in a slot. The digital readout above the 
      keypad reads: OVERRIDE CODE?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley tries to remember. Forrest is too busy 
      repeating:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>(mouths)<br/>Countermeasures?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Hesitantly, Riley begins punching in a 
      sequence of numbers. Forrest frantically scribbles --</font></p>
<p>

      incorrect.<br/>Ten seconds to lethal countermeasures.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley is trying again -- Forrest holds his 
      pad behind Riley with emphasis, though Riley doesn't turn to read 
      it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It reads: COME ON, COME ON...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley keeps punching code. He cracks a smile 
      of "I'm totally fucked."</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As a last resort, Riley tries to pull the 
      wires out of the goddamn box -- and the lights go off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The door slides open. Behind it stands a 
      none too pleased Maggie, two other scientists behind her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley and Forrest step out of the elevator 
      -- Forrest with serious alacrity -- and stand before her. She points at a 
      sign on the wall, then turns and walks away, the others in tow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley and Forrest look at the sign before 
      they follow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It reads: IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, USE

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There are a lot of people here, but it's 
      totally different. Quiet, for one thing. People stand in groups, touching, 
      writing things on notepads, all with questioning looks. The occasional 
      person runs through the room in panic. One girl is crying in her 
      boyfriend's arms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara makes her way into the room, looking 
      about her shyly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Someone drops a bottle of Snapple or some 
      such. It smashes on the floor, startling everyone a bit. Sheepishly, the 
      person moves to clean it.</font></p>

      them, she exits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE STREET - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Willow make their way through the 
      street. Needless to say, it's quiet, but nevertheless there is a great 
      deal of activity going on there. The girls walk hand in hand, needing the 
      feel of each other's presence as they take in the following 
      tableaux:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE BANK, which has a sign saying "Sorry, 
      we're CLOSED".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE LIQUOR STORE, which has a sign saying 
      "Yes, we're OPEN!", and a line that reaches well out the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A MAN, in a business suit, sitting in the 
      middle of the road crying.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A CAR that is up on the sidewalk after 
      crashing into the fire hydrant. A fountain of water shoots up next to 
      it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A PRAYER MEETING is being held in the nook 
      by the magic shop. A preacher stands before a congregation reading 
      silently from a bible. Next to him, an old woman holds a small chalkboard 
      with the chapter and verse written on it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Some ten people kneel before him, also 
      reading silently. As they pray, a young college student joins them, 
      kneels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A MAN SELLING DRY ERASE BOARDS on the 
      sidewalk. $10 apiece. They come with the velcroed on marker and a string 
      to keep them around your neck (he wears one as demonstration). He's doing 
      some business.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The girls pass by it all, wary and watching. 
      See dry erase guy and give each other a look: what a sleaze.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - CONTINUING 
      (DAY)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The gang's almost all here. Giles is at the 
      table, researching. Xander and Anya watch TV with the sound off, waiting 
      for some kind of bulletin. Olivia sits with a good strong drink in her 
      hands. She clearly is the least prepared for this. She smiles politely at 
      the girls as they enter, then takes a prodigious swing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander and Anya look back at the girls, she 
      nods in greeting. He stands, starts towards them -- a fact registered by 
      Anya, who still questions his affections. But he stops, waves lamely -- he 
      has nothing to say -- and turns back to the TV, perching on the arm of the 
      sofa.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles rises, puts his hand on Buffy's 
      arm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy returns the grip briefly, then looks 
      at Giles, at the books. Anything?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles rises, puts his hand on Buffy's 
      arm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy returns the grip briefly, then looks 
      at Giles, at the books. Anything?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she does, Willow determinedly scribbles 
      on her board -- she has something to say.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles shrugs at Buffy -- no leads so 
      far.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow holds her board out for him to 
      read.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It says, "Hi Giles."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He smiles and gives her a paternal one armed 
      hug in response.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy absently removes her board as she 
      looks at Giles' notes -- and sees the ones from last night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON: GILES' NOTES. We see the two lines 
      "Can't even shout, Can't even cry". It clicks, Buffy silently groaning 
      that she didn't remember it before.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She picks Giles' notepad from the pile of 
      books, holds it up, pointing to the top where he has written "THE 
      GENTLEMEN". Gives him a questioning look. Again he shrugs, indicating 
      there is nothing in the books.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander snaps, trying to get their attention 
      as Anya turns the TV up. Something has come on: The local newscaster, with 
      a special report.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Everyone gathers round to listen.</font></p>
<p>

      this may sound -- <b>laryngitis</b>.<br/>It seems the entire town 
      has<br/>been rendered unable to speak.<br/>There is no word yet what 
      might<br/>have caused this or what other<br/>effects might be seen from 
      this<br/>epidemic. Local authorities have<br/>issued a statement -- a 
      written<br/>statement, I should say -- blaming<br/>recent flu vaccinations. 
      A few<br/>skeptics call it a city-wide hoax.<br/>In the meanwhile, Sunnydale 
      has<br/>effectively shut down; all schools<br/>and businesses will be closed 
      for<br/>the time being, and residents are<br/>advised to stay home and rest 
      up.<br/>The Center for Disease Control has<br/>ordered the entire town 
      quarantined --<br/>no one can go in or out -- until<br/>the syndrome is 
      identified or the<br/>symptoms disappear. We'll bring<br/>you more on that 
      as it develops.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander mouths, "That's it?", clearly 
      frustrated. He turns the sound off again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy takes her board from the table, writes 
      on it, holds it up to the others: "Keep researching. I should be in town

      function. She types and it speaks. She sits in an impromptu command center 
      in the middle of the room. A clear map of the town, computers, a table and

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy walks down the street, past a car that 
      has hit a hydrant. Water gushes up above the car. In the background, kids 
      are hanging out on a bench, blasting a boombox and partying a little too 
      hard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy see something ahead, stops.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">REVERSE ANGLE: RILEY is by the bookstore. On 
      the sidewalk, someone has started a trash can fire, and Riley is framed in 
      front of it. He is getting between two businessmen who are in a fistfight. 
      Riley tries to be nice, then pushes one away sternly and effectively when 
      he gets in his face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy comes up quickly. Riley has turned to 
      talk to the other guy. As his back is turned the first guy picks up a pipe 
      -- but Buffy comes up and grabs his wrist, twisting it quickly and 
      efficiently till we hear something snap. The guy screams and drops to his 
      knees, Buffy never even stopping or looking at the guy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley has defused the second guy, turns to 
      see Buffy. They fall into a strong embrace. Look at each other.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She touches his face. They hear glass 
      breaking down the street and he indicates he should go. She nods, 
      indicating she is heading the other way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They part as far as holding hands, then pull 
      each other back into a kiss.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He goes. Buffy watches a moment, then takes

      well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy enters, clearly beat. Willow looks up 
      at her: anything?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">By way of answer, Buffy just keeps moving to 
      the bed and collapses face down onto it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow sighs, goes back to her work --

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see only the bottom of the door as it

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They approach from the clock tower, heading 
      into town. Three pairs of Gentlemen, each pair with two Footmen flanking 
      them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Gentlemen float just above ground, grins 
      fixed. Two of them have spectacles, and they are various heights, but 
      besides that, they are most similar. They split up, heading into different 
      areas of town.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">After a bit she rises, pulls on his robe and 
      pads downstairs toward the kitchen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She stops, hearing something outside. Moves 
      slowly toward the window. A glance to the sleeping Giles, then at the 
      window, pulling the gauze curtain aside, peering out into the 
      night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: OLIVIA'S POV</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Through the window we see the dark street. 
      It seems as though something is floating toward us from off in the 
      shadows. We hold on it... and ANOTHER ONE floats into frame not two feet 
      from us, grinning right at us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Olivia starts back, terrified. For a long

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now he struggles, trying to shout for help, 
      the effort soundless, useless.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Gentlemen float in, the door closing 
      behind them, and float to the bed. One on each side.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The smaller of the two opens his doctors bag 
      and withdraws a scalpel. He hands it to the taller.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They smile at each other, at the prospect of

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Five Gentlemen hover together, rustling like 
      tall grass, as the sixth, our tall one, places his booty on the 
      shrine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It is the boy's heart, still fresh and 
      sticky. He puts it in a chalice, and we widen to see there are seven 
      chalices total, three of them containing hearts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He turns to his companions. Golf 
      claps.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY AND WILLOW'S DORM HALL - 
      MORNING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy comes out of her room and instantly 
      senses something is wrong. At the junction to the next hall, a pair of 
      girls comforting each other. Buffy heads that way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. OTHER DORM HALL - CONTINUING - 
      MORNING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy enters to find more people, six or 
      seven, most of them clustered around the boy's room. Buffy moves toward 
      them, passes through.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BOY'S DORM ROOM - CONTINUING - 
      MORNING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The lights are still off in here, and the 
      shades drawn. Buffy enters, moves slowly to the body. Looks down at 
      it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - MORNING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Olivia sits on the stairs, drawing. She's 
      clearly still shaken. Giles puts a mug of coffee beside her, crosses to 
      the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He opens it, grabbing the morning paper from 
      his doorstep.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The headline reads: "BRUTAL SLAYING SHOCKS 
      SILENT COMMUNITY"</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And the sub-heading: "15 Year Old Girl Found 
      Stabbed, Heart Was Missing."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Focus on the words "Heart Was 
      Missing."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Something starts to click in Giles' mind. He 
      looks at Olivia, who holds up her sketch: what she saw last 
      night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles sees the picture, throws down his 
      paper and crosses to his bookshelf. Scans the demon books until he finds a 
      particular volume and pulls it out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The title reads: "FAIRY TALES"</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUING 
      (DAY)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The lights are low -- it's dim but not dark. 
      Xander is closing the last of the blinds. He heads down from the back to 
      the front where the other are gathered. Buffy, Willow and Anya are in 
      front row seats, Willow all ready to take notes. Giles is pulling the 
      screen down. He has an overhead projector and a series of transparencies 
      set up on the desk. Xander stands to one side, waits with the 
      rest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles slides a transparency on the 
      projector, we see it on the screen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "WHO ARE THE 
      GENTLEMEN?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles puts the next sheet on the 
      projector.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: A picture, in Giles' 
      borderline child drawing, of a Gentleman, with the heading "THEY ARE FAIRY 
      TALE MONSTERS."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Next sheet:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "WHAT DO THEY 
      WANT?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow's hand shoots up. Before Giles can 
      put his transparency up, Willow points meaningfully at her 
      heart.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(mouths)<br/>Boobies?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "HEARTS." Incongruously sweet 
      cartoon hearts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles places one on after another, tells a 
      story thus:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "THEY COME TO A TOWN..." Two 
      Gentlemen on a hill overlooking a small town.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "THEY STEAL ALL THE VOICES, 
      SO NO ONE CAN SCREAM." A gentleman with his hand out, pulling some 
      smoke-like mist out of the mouths of a group of people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "THEN:" A Gentleman entering 
      a bedroom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: A Gentleman cutting into a 
      sleeping man. Kind of bloody.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: The Gentleman holding his 
      heart up. There is blood everywhere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The kids exchange looks: Giles getting a 
      little carried away with the blood there, gives them pause. All except 
      Anya, who finds the picture show kind of neat. She even munches from a bag 
      of popcorn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "THEY NEED SEVEN." Picture of 
      seven hearts. "THEY HAVE AT LEAST TWO."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander has scribbled on a pad, holds up for 
      all to see: HOW DO YOU KILL THEM?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy snorts contemptuously, then circles 
      her fist around an imaginary stake, plunges it down repeatedly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Everybody looks at her, a little thrown: the 
      gesture doesn't read the way she intended.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Realizing it, Buffy hurriedly and sheepishly 
      grabs a stake from her purse, repeats the gesture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Everyone makes, "Oh, I get it" 
      faces.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Giles shakes his head, puts 
      up:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "IN THE TALES, NO SWORD CAN 
      KILL THEM." A Gentleman with several swords in him, still 
      grinnin'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "BUT THE PRINCESS SCREAMED 
      ONCE AND THEY ALL DIED." A princess yelling her head off, Gentlemen 
      falling over dead. "THEY CANNOT STAND THE HUMAN VOICE."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Taking a deep breath, Buffy lets out her 
      best yell. Not a peep. Makes a "that's not gonna work" face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow goes frantic with an idea, reaches 
      into her bag and pulls out a CD. Mimes a person singing, then a Gentleman 
      covering his ears in pain and then flopping over dead with his tongue 
      hanging out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles is ready for that one:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "ONLY A REAL HUMAN VOICE." 
      Picture of a Gentleman perfectly happy with a gramophone playing 
      nearby.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow makes a "Fine, whatever" 
      gesture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy has written, holds up: "How do I get 
      my voice back?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles shrugs, points to books. Still 
      looking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He places another sheet on:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE SCREEN: "BUFFY WILL PATROL TONIGHT." 
      Picture of Buffy (that Buffy finds less than flattering) with a 
      crossbow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy nods. Giles then points to himself and 
      the others, then picks up a research book.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander objects. Points to himself, then 
      mimes himself hunting with a rifle. Giles acquiesces, and Xander smiles 
      happily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Everyone stands, the show and tell 
      concluded. Buffy crosses to the desk, picks up the picture of the 
      Gentleman, the first one. Studies it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. THE INITIATIVE - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley and the boys are suiting up. We see 
      the papers with the headlines, but no other info like Giles 
has.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy patrols. Unlike last night, the 
      streets are empty. No one wants to be out on such a night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET BY THE CLOCK TOWER - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley does as well. Sees the clock tower -- 
      the bottom is boarded up and there is suspicious movement either 
      downstairs or behind the clock face, depending on what we can manage. He 
      starts toward it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. TARA'S ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Next to the book, we see a bunch of notes 
      made out about spells -- another book lies open to the section: Spells of 
      Speech and Silence. Next to that is the school directory, with the 
      underlined entry: WILLOW ROSENBERG.......STEVENSON, RM 214 and her phone 
      number.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara gathers up her books, heads for the 
      door. Hand on the knob, she takes a moment to compose herself. 
      Exits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She walks quickly through the empty campus, 
      throwing glances about her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Naturally, she drops her books.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see her from behind, at a distance, 
      stopping to pick them up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Two Gentlemen float into frame from behind 
      camera.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">REVERSE ANGLE: Tara is in foreground, 
      oblivious, as the two leering specters approach, some thirty feet 
      behind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Finally she senses something, turns 
      around.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: TARA'S POV</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They smile right at us. Their Footmen coming 
      out from behind them, loping our way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Soundlessly, she screams, abandoning her 
      books and scrambling away. She heads for the dorms, turning a corner just 
      ahead of the Footmen, the Gentlemen bringing up the rear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy stops, sees something. She spots a 
      Gentleman far away -- and is suddenly jumped by two Footmen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. THIRD DORM HALL - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara bursts in, running in a dead panic. She 
      stops at a door in the middle of the hall, pounds on it, mouthing 
      "HELP!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GIRL'S DORM ROOM - CONTINUING - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The girl whose door it is sits terrified in 
      bed, not knowing what is out there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. THIRD DORM HALL - CONTINUING 
      (NIGHT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara pounds -- and the Gentlemen enter the 
      hall, heading effortlessly toward her. She flees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy throws one Footman to the ground. She 
      grabs the other by the head and twists its neck 180 degrees. It falls 
      dead, and the other takes off, loping for home.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy gives chase.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GROUND FLOOR OF CLOCK TOWER - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley enters the dark space by the front 
      door. He makes his way cautiously, heads for the stairs -- and is jumped 
      by a Footman. He loses his rifle, which skitters across the 
      floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He pulls his telescoping baton from his boot 
      and snaps it out to full length. Slams it under the back of the Footman's 
      legs, sends him sprawling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A second one leaps on him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUING - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara runs up the stairs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY AND WILLOW'S DORM HALL - A MOMENT 
      LATER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara turns the corner here and starts 
      banging on doors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY AND WILLOW'S DORM ROOM - 
      CONTINUING - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow is awake -- she hears the running and 
      the pounding. Hesitantly, she approaches her door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY AND WILLOW'S DORMHALL - 
      CONTINUING (NIGHT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara is pounding on the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY AND WILLOW'S DORM ROOM - 
      CONTINUING (NIGHT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Summoning her courage, Willow reaches for 
      the door --</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY AND WILLOW'S DORM HALL - 
      CONTINUING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The door swings open in front of 
      Tara.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A Gentleman stands behind it. Grinning right 
      at her, the heart of a student held in his bony hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara starts back -- just as the first team 
      of Gentlemen reach the hall. Their Footmen come charging around them and 
      head for the girl.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara barrels down the hall. She looks back 
      at her pursuers -- just as Willow comes out of HER room -- Tara slams into 
      her and they both tumble, the door slamming shut.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Quickly, they scramble up, head out of the 
      hall together. Willow is limping from the crash.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUING - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Incredibly similar to the one Tara went up. 
      They start down the stairs, moving as fast as they can, the Footmen hard 
      behind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GROUND FLOOR OF CLOCK TOWER - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley elbows one Footman off him as the 
      other scrambles back, jumps on him. Riley hits the ground, reaches for his 
      gun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: BY THE DOOR</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Footman that Buffy was chasing comes in 
      the door, scared. He passes the boarded-up window, and Buffy comes 
      crashing through, crossbow slung over her back like a rifle, tackling him 
      --</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">--Riley reaches his gun, slams the butt into 
      the face of the Footman--</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">--Buffy kicks her Footman, throws another, 
      reaches back for her crossbow spinning--</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley comes up with the rifle:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They are facing each other, her with 
      crossbow, him with stun gun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They stare at each other.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Staring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There are three Footmen here, and now they 
      attack en masse -- too close for weapons. Riley throws one while Buffy 
      kicks hers. Riley gets his far enough away to blast it with an electrical 
      charge. It keels over, spazzing out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy fires wide as the third is on her, 
      knocking the crossbow down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley turns and sees:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy spinning, kicking to the head, then 
      planting and driving the heel of her hand to the Footman's chest, sending 
      him flying back into a beam and snapping it (someone told me we had a 
      snapping beam).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley is even more stunned. This girl is 
      superhuman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's grabbed from behind. Buffy sees one 
      going upstairs, starts to take off after it, then looks to Riley. He seems 
      to be in control of his fight, so she decides to follow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles crosses out of the kitchen and into 
      the back room with two steaming mugs of coffee, passing Spike who opens 
      the fridge. Spike pulls out a cup of blood, drinks deep.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">When he lowers the mug he is in Vampface -- 
      good blood!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He crosses the living room where Anya has 
      fallen asleep on the couch researching. He puts his mug on the coffee 
      table, knocking over some books. Peeved, he kneels to retrieve 
      them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander enters, tired. From his POV it looks 
      like Spike is bending over Anya's neck. Spike sits up -- he's in vampface 
      and has blood on his mouth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander launches himself over the couch, 
      taking Spike to the ground and beating on him. Anya sits up -- what's 
      going on? Spike tries to point Anya out but can't make a sound.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles and Olivia rush out from the back 
      room, sees what's up. Xander sees them, stops, looks over at 
      Anya.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">When he finally realizes Anya is okay, he 
      rushes to her, kisses her. Spike sits up, dully furious.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anya smiles, pleased by his display of true 
      caring. Coquettishly, she makes a circle with her thumb and forefinger and 
      sticks her other finger in it repeatedly. Xander smiles and they take off 
      together, leaving Spike, Giles and Olivia a little grossed out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - A MOMENT 
LATER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The girls enter and slam the door behind 
      them, lock it. A Footman slams into it from the other side. Again -- it's 
      clearly going to give.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">In the middle of the room by a pillar, 
      several feet in front of the door, is a coke machine. Willow moves toward 
      it, tries pushing it, Tara falling in to help. No go. She takes a step 
      back and stumbles on her bad leg, going clumsily to the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She thinks a moment. Then, sitting up, she 
      concentrates on the soda machine. Stares at it, brow furrowed. Tara 
      watches her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It shakes. It moves -- all of an 
      inch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Exhausted, Willow stops. It's too 
      big.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The door nearly slams off its 
      hinges.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara sits by Willow and slips her hand into 
      Willow's. Fingers intertwining. Willow looks up at Tara. A 
beat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As one, they turn to the soda 
      machine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It flies back into the door like a 
      cannonball.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow looks at it, at Tara. She doesn't let 
      go her hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy climbs up past a pendulum and into the 
      clock tower. She looks to her right -- there is a shrine of jars, five of 
      them full. No sooner does she see it than she is jumped by four Footmen. 
      They wrestle her to the ground -- and here come the Gentlemen, the tall 
      guy leading, scalpel in hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy struggles but he is about to cut 
      --</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">His partner looks on with glee, the others 
      behind. Then his partner is blown out of frame by an electrical 
      blast.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: RILEY is still behind the pendulum. 
      He fires again, hits a Footman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">That's all Buffy needs. She wrestles free, 
      kicking the Footmen away, and starts fighting. The fight takes her over to 
      the other side of the clock tower.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley fires his weapon -- out of juice. He 
      throws it down and takes on a couple hand to hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Gentlemen stand off to one side, 
      grinning but worried.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy is doing her best, but it's hard -- 
      the she sees:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: THE BOX</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">In the middle of the shrine, behind 
      Riley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FLASH: BUFFY'S DREAM -- we se the box in the 
      girl's hands.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy signals to Riley, who is blocked from 
      her by Footmen, to smash the box. He gets the message, grabs his rifle and 
      swings his rifle and swings the butt down on a harmless incense 
      bowl.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Keeping the Footmen at bay, Buffy points to 
      the box impatiently, mimes opening a box. Riley turns --</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">--Buffy is suddenly stabbed by a Gentleman, 
      right in the arms. It throws her off and she is knocked to the ground face 
      first by a Footman.</font></p>

      very pissed, taking in a huge breath --</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She scream. Long, hard, top of her

      agony.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Gentlemen put their hands to their ears,

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There is a great deal of commotion, kids 
      playing, chatting -- happy to be able to talk again. Willow and Tara find 
      a relatively quiet corner together.</font></p>

      me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(nods)<br/>I thought m-m-maybe 
      we could<br/>do a spell... make people talk<br/>again. I'd seen you... in 
      the<br/>group, the w-w-wicca group.<br/>You were... different than 
      them.<br/>They didn't seem to know...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What they were talking 
      about?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara smiles shyly: exactly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I think if they saw a 
      w-w-witch<br/>they would... run away.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yeah. So how long have<br/>you 
      been practicing?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Always. I mean, since I was 
      little...<br/>My mom used to... she had a lot of<br/>power. Like 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh, I'm not -- I don't 
      have<br/>much in the way of power,<br/>really, I mean most of my<br/>potions 
      come out... soup.<br/>Also spells going awry,<br/>friends in danger 
      --<br/>I'm definitely nothing special.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>No, you are.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks Willow in the eye as she says it. 
      She means it. A moment, and she looks away again, embarrassed by her 
      forwardness.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well, I thought we made<br/>a 
      pretty good team --<br/>not getting killed at all....<br/>with some soda 
      machine, boom!<br/>Pretty cool. Seems like you're<br/>kinda 
      powerful.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I'd like to be. I feel 
      like<br/>I'm stuck. Like I'm at the<br/>door and it won't 
      open.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I know exactly what you 
      mean.</font></center>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OLIVIA<br/>All that time you used 
      to<br/>talk about witchcraft and<br/>darkness and the like...<br/>I just 
      thought you were pretentious.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Oh, I was. But I was also 
      right.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OLIVIA<br/>So everything you told me was 
      true.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Well, no, I wasn't 
      actually<br/>one of the original members<br/>of Pink Floyd. But the 
      monster<br/>stuff, yes.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OLIVIA<br/>Scary.</font></center>

<p></p>
