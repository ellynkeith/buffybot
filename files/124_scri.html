<div align="right">FADE IN:</div>EXT. GERMANY - NIGHT 
      <p>A deserted TOWN SQUARE. Modern, fairly urban - tattered German text 
      posters for local rock bands cling to brick walls. We hear the wail of 
      POLICE SIRENS as a lone unmarked car splashes through the square, its 
      headlights casting stark shadows. 
      <p>The car passes. We hold on a young (fifteen-ish) PUNK GIRL. Pressed up 
      against a brick wall, behind some garbage cans, just barely out of sight. 
      And despite her leather jacket, nose rings and pink hair - she looks 
      terrified. 
      <p>FADE IN SUBTITLE: <u>FRANKFURT</u>
<p>The girl scans the square. 
      <p>We see her P.O.V. The square is empty. Summoning her courage, the girl 
      emerges from her hiding place and walks quickly across, looking over her 
      shoulder. 
      <p>She keeps walking, her clattering footsteps the only sound echoing in 
      the square. We see how young and innocent her face is, illuminated by 
      street lamps. Then slowly, suspicious, she stops walking ... 
      <p>But the sound of footsteps keeps coming. 
      <p>The girl does not turn back. Instead, looking straight ahead, she sees 
      the nightmarish image of two SHADOWS cast upon the wall before her. 
      Looming large - and running her way. She gasps - and RUNS. She's fast. 
      <p>ANGLE ON: A homeless DRUNK, nursing his bottle of cheap booze in a 
      paper bag, nearly gets run over by the fleeing girl. 
      <p>

<p>But he stops himself short as two ROBED FIGURES, not fully seen, run 
      after the girl. The drunk stares, frightened. 
      <p>ANGLE ON: An ALLEY. The girl turns a corner, fast. The men in robes 
      follow fast behind. 
      <p>The girl stops. She's got moves - or at least, a strong instinct for 
      survival. 
      <p>She grabs the first robed man as he rounds the corner, yanks his arm 
      hard up behind him, and sends him SMASHING face-first into the second 
      robed man. 
      <p>They hit the ground. She turns to run - but one of the robed figures 
      REACHES OUT from where he lies - and just manages to snag Punk Girl's 
      ankle. 
      <p>Running, she trips and FALLS - hard on the pavement, splashing 
      painfully into a shallow puddle. She turns, quickly, looking up to see: 
      <p>The two robed figures are now standing, looming above her and they pull 
      from within their robes CEREMONIAL DAGGERS. 
      <p>Her eyes go wide with fear - she holds up her thin white hand to 
      protect herself - and we go over to the brick wall behind her to see 
      SHADOWS - 
      <p>A sickening shadow play of the robed figures STABBING into the girl 
      again and again without mercy. 
      <p>When, as suddenly as it started - it stops. The shadow figures stand 
      upright, looking down. 
      <p>Coming off the shadows, we move in on the girl's dead face. And even 
      though she is clearly dead, flecks of blood freckle her cheeks, her mouth 
      opens and an incongruously DEEP VOICE echoes out of her: 
      <p>
<center>GIRL<br/>From beneath you, it devours ...</center>
<p>
<div align="right">AND CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S (FORMERLY JOYCE'S) ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>DAWN. Looking directly at us, yelling to be heard: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Buffy - Buffy - BUFFY!</center>
<p>We reveal that we are now in Buffy's bedroom. BUFFY sits upright in 
      bed, sheets still around her, as Dawn, gripping her by the shoulders, 
      tries to get her attention. 
      <p>Buffy slowly re-orients herself, "sees" Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I heard screaming. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>That was you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And ... there was a girl. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>That would be me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, it was ... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>... Just a dream. <br/>(beat)<br/>It was just a dream, 
      right?</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They exchange a look. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Vision, maybe. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>That explains the screaming. And I'm<br/>guessing we can rule 
      out any visions<br/>involving winning the lottery ... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>"From beneath you, it devours."<br/>That's all she could say. 
      And then<br/>they ...<br/>(beat)<br/>There's more like her, Dawn. 
      <br/>Somewhere. Out there.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy rises, looks out her window. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>And they're qonna die.</center>
<p>Dawn joins Buffy by the window, also looking out, but while Buffy 
      stares into space, Dawn can't see any danger. So Dawn shuts the window. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Okay! Vision break. It's all too<br/>cryptic to figure out 
      in one night<br/>anyway. Let's go downstairs and I'll<br/>make you a nice 
      cup of tea. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I hate tea. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Me, too. It's the gesture. Come on.</p></p></center>
<p>Dawn leads Buffy out of the bedroom, talking as she goes. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>You know we can never tell Giles <br/>about the 
      tea thing, right? I think<br/>he'd like, crack in half or<br/>something 
      ...</center>
<p>But Buffy pauses, turns back, looking out the window. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(to herself) <br/>"From beneath you ..."</center>
<p>She shakes it off, unable to figure it out, and follows Dawn out the 
      door 
      <p>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Outside, at night, we move down through the trees to find a quiet 
      suburban Sunnydale street. Establishing. Not a car in sight. When we hear 
      a deep rumbling sound. Growing louder, coming this way ... 
      <p>We see, beneath the earth, something BIG (not the something itself, but 
      the wake it leaves behind it) - BURROWING its way through the soft grassy 
      ground, displacing earth and grass as it plows along. 
      <p>It reaches the sidewalk and keeps going - SMASHING its way through the 
      asphalt, sending cement buckling. Whatever it is it is seemingly 
      unstoppable, heading our way. 
      <p>With a horrible gurgling roar, it descends back down into the earth and 
      disappears, leaving only the path of destruction and the quiet night 
      behind ...

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - DAY 
      <p>Moving along the condensation-dripping walls of the dank Sunnydale High 
      basement, we come upon - a RAT. And we hear: 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (O.S.)<br/>No no no no no no no ...</center>
<p>We see SPIKE come into frame, eyeing the rat hungrily, stalking ... 
      Spike's looked better. Bags under his eyes (which stare wildly) hair 
      grown-out and crazy in all directions, clothes smudged and dirty. He wants 
      that rat. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Now is not the time, you know it, I<br/>know it, making 
      them understand - a<br/>totally different matter.</center>
<p>He's getting closer, moving stealthily, ready to pounce... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>No manners, is the problem, proper <br/>breeding, 
      respect for etiquette, all <br/>of it lacking...</center>
<p>He slows, looking around... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>All of it lost on 'em ...</center>
<p>And he stops rambling for a second, hearing something coming. And he 
      becomes, just for a split-second, totally coherent. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Bye-bye, lunchtime.</center>
<p>The rumbling continues, growing louder, coming this way. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Not the time. Not hardly ready...</center>
<p>The rumbling grows even louder. Pipes shudder and shake. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Stop.</center>
<p>Spike winces in agony as the sound grows. He looks beneath him, 
      stepping as if on a hot surface, trying to avoid the ground, but of course 
      unable to. He stops, pleads with someone who is not there. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Please, mum. Begging now, make it <br/>stop. Make 
      it ... God ... </center>
<p>Spike drops to his knees, in pain, still clutching the side of his 
      head. He wraps his arms around his skull, trying in vain to block out the 
      noise, but cannot. He wails ... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Aaaahh... nnggh...</center>
<p>And Spike's pain rises along with the rumbling. Everything in the 
      cramped basement space is shaking now, like an earthquake is coming. Spike 
      raises his head and SCREAMS out loud to the heavens above, his voice 
      almost matching the rising roar in volume as we cut to... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>AaaaaaaAAAAARHHHH!!! 
      <p>DAWN (O.S.)<br/>Could you die?</p></center>
<p>EXT. STREET - DAY 
      <p>We see Xander, dressed like a grown-up (jacket and coolly loose-fitting 
      tie) driving Buffy (shotgun) and Dawn (backseat) to school. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>'Cause, seriously, just speaking for <br/>all the people 
      who are me in the car? <br/>We're very excited. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, I'm glad for all of you then. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's just so cool. You're coming to <br/>school with me! You'll 
      be like, <br/>right there, the whole time.<br/>(beat)<br/>You understand you 
      can never talk to <br/>me, look at me, or hang out anywhere<br/>near my 
      friends, right? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You've been very specific. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I forgot high school's unwritten <br/>rules of hallway 
      etiquette. Of <br/>course, no one ever explained them to <br/>me, they'd 
      just stuff me in a locker <br/>'til I drew my own conclusions. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I don't mean to sound all "Cordelia <br/>Chase Part Two" about 
      it... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Appreciated... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's just, I don't want my big sister<br/>humiliating me five 
      days a week. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Three. Three days a week. I'm only<br/>doing this community 
      counseling gig <br/>part time, so if you want to be <br/>embarrassed 
      Tuesdays and Thursdays? <br/>You're on your own, Missy. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>But if you're looking for a tutor? <br/>(raising his 
      hand)<br/>Years in the field. Just saying. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I doubt you'll see me at all, <br/>assuming I even 
      half-understand my <br/>fuzzy job description ... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's not fuzzy. You're what, dealing<br/>with "troubled" kids? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>At a spanking new Hellmouth High.<br/>Please. Outside of 
      drugs, violence,<br/>unwanted pregnancy and the unleashed <br/>hordes of 
      Armageddon that come <br/>pouring out the school's foundation <br/>every now 
      and then ... what kind of <br/>"trouble" could these kids have? 
      <p>BUFFY <br/>(unsure)<br/>Guess I'll find out. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You're sounding a little less than <br/>Gung-ho about the job, 
      there, Buff. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Huh? Oh, it's not the job of it, <br/>it's ... anyone else find 
      it a little <br/>weird that Principal Wood just -<br/>hired me? Just like 
      that? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Just like what? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Guy gives you a job... not exactly a<br/>thrilling tale of 
      horror. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Just seems, I don't know ... convenient. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Maybe. Doesn't make it bad. Those<br/>kids got damn lucky, 
      having a Slayer<br/>and a friend on campus there for 'em.<br/>Hope they 
      appreciate it.<br/>(beat)<br/>I know I did.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>A moment passes between Buffy and Xander - she looks to him, struck by 
      the sincere compliment. He keeps driving. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>(nostalgic)<br/>Days gone by, huh? 
      <p>DAWN <br/>(to Xander)<br/>I thought you hated Sunnydale. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yes and no. With a heavy emphasis on<br/>the yes, but at least 
      I was dating<br/>then. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You could be dating now. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Yeah, you're a guy with a car and a <br/>job and a tie. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>All hard to resist. 
      <p>XANDER <br/>(shrugs, "yeah, but")<br/>I dunno what's not clicking for 
      me<br/>right now. 
      <p>BUFFY <br/>Well, that thing with Anya... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>The leaving her at the altar thing? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, that one. That's not something<br/>you just bounce right 
      back from. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Sure it is. She bounced back to<br/>being a Vengeance Demon 
      and I bounced<br/>back to being a dateless nerd. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Do you guys talk at all? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I've seen her at The Bronze a couple<br/>times... guess 
      there's a lot of<br/>scorned women there making Vengeance<br/>wishes on 
      their exes. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's where I go to get my<br/>scorn on... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You guys should really ease up with<br/>the whole "dating 
      demons" thing. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hello, you were the one having the<br/>Smooch-athon with 
      teen-vampire last<br/>Halloween. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>See, this is why I don't want<br/>you talking to my 
      friends.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD walking out from behind Buffy's spanking-new DESK, 
      situated in the middle of her NEW OFFICE (A glass partitioned semi-cubicle 
      fitted into an alcove off the main section of the Principal's Office; it 
      has a full view through the glass of the hallway outside, and the STUDENTS 
      passing through it on their way to class). The Principal is in mid- 
      orientation ... 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>We'll sort of feel our way along.<br/>Some 
      students will be sent to you and<br/>I'm hoping others will start to 
      come<br/>on their own. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What if they don't? Should I panic? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You might be surprised, Buffy.<br/>You're the youngest 
      and, uh ...<br/>(re: his own tie)<br/>... least stuffy member of this 
      <br/>faculty. I think the students'll <br/>want to talk to you, and when 
      they <br/>do, don't evaluate them, just listen.<br/>They need to know they 
      have someone <br/>here who's on their side. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Can I give detention? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Okay by me. A little authority can<br/>be a wonderful 
      thing. Just remember<br/>that while you're here to help, <br/>you're not 
      their friend. Trust me<br/>, open that door, these students will <br/>eat 
      you alive. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You heard about Principal Flutie, <br/>right? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD <br/>Hmm? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Forget it.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>A beat, then. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Okay, then. I think that's pretty<br/>much it; 
      you got your phone, your <br/>desk, and I've imparted all the <br/>wisdom I 
      can for one morning. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And for that, I thank you. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Oh, there'll be more. Everything<br/>happens on a case 
      by case basis<br/>around here anyway, and I've got bags<br/>more wisdom 
      stashed away in my office.</p></p></center>
<p>He turns to go. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Right. I'll just ... come to you<br/>with questions when 
      they come to me<br/>with questions. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Great. Relax, there's only three<br/>things these kids 
      understand: the<br/>boot, the bat, and the bastinada.<br/>(beat)<br/>Bad 
      joke. It's the "bastinada." No <br/>one ever knows what that thing is. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Wooden rod they use to smack the<br/>soles of your feet in 
      Turkish <br/>prisons, but if you use the right <br/>wood, it makes an 
      awesome billy club.</p></p></center>
<p>Long pause as Principal Wood looks at Buffy like she's grown a second 
      head. Then he smiles. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Think you're qonna fit in just fine.<br/>Is there 
      something else? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Just one thing. I was curious, and<br/>don't think I'm not 
      grateful or <br/>anything, but ... why is it exactly<br/>I ... 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>... Have this job? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I still haven't finished college. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I know. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So was it my sparkling personality,<br/>or maybe you've just 
      enjoyed my work<br/>at the Double Meat Palace ... 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I'm a vegetarian. <br/>(beat)<br/>The students need 
      someone who<br/>understands them; I need someone who<br/>understands 
      students. Why? <br/>Something about you I don't know -<br/>and maybe 
      should?</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He awaits an answer. Buffy's taken aback - but recovers, smiling. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Nothing I can think of.</center>
<p>TWO KIDS and a TEACHER enter the office area. The Teacher looks weary. 
      The boys look like they've been fighting. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>If you'll excuse me. First catch of<br/>the day. 
      Be in my office if you need <br/>me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Thanks. I'm gonna look around, get <br/>to know the place... 
      Make sure it's<br/>all...</p></center>
<p>She trails off as he enters his office with the two boys, shutting the 
      door behind him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>... all schoollike.</center>
<p>A beat, then her expression hardens. She heads out. 
      <p>INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT (SPIKE'S LIVING AREA) - DAY 
      <p>Back in the basement. The door to Spike's small living area slowly 
      opens. Buffy enters, slowly, cautiously, looking around. 
      <p>We see Buffy's P.O.V. It's dark and dank and drippy. Plenty of places 
      to hide; plenty of places from which someone could jump out at her. 
      <p>Buffy walks all the way in as the door begins to slowly close behind 
      her, unnoticed. That is, until it CLOSES with a loud echo. Buffy lumps a 
      bit, but shakes it off. 
      <p>She keeps exploring the dank space. Looks around. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike?</center>
<p>But the place is completely empty. Not a single trace of Spike. Buffy 
      stands alone in it, confused... 
      <p>As we hear a small, panting sound ... 
      <p>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>And cut to a panting little SHIH-TZU DOG, padding along the suburban 
      sidewalked street, being walked by its owner, an attractive young woman 
      named NANCY. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY<br/>Rocky! Come on, baby, do your <br/>business, I want to get 
      home.</center>
<p>The dog keeps trotting away on its RETRACTABLE LEASH, looking for a 
      spot to pee. Nancy sighs. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY (cont'd) <br/>Come on, baby ...<br/>(to herself)<br/>I coulda 
      gotten a cat, but no ...</center>
<p>We see the dog trot out to the end of its leash. 
      <p>See Nancy standing alone, waiting ... 
      <p>There is a small, almost imperceptible JERK on the leash line as we 
      hear a small "yip" from the dog's direction. 
      <p>And Nancy looks over ... 
      <p>And we see her P.O.V.: The leash line ends, not with a cute little 
      puppy on the other end, but instead, sticking in a hole in the ground. 
      Just stuck there. An odd tableau. 
      <p>Nancy doesn't move, just watches, a bit struck by the strangeness of 
      this vision ... 
      <p>When BOOM! Nancy gets suddenly and violently JERKED off her feet by a 
      mighty TUG on the end of the leash line. 
      <p>She hits the sidewalk in a full-body dive, hard. 
      <p>From the ground, Nancy looks up - just as she gets PULLED along the 
      sidewalk, hard and fast, painfully. 
      <p>Nancy's P.O.V.: She is getting pulled toward a CRACKED HOLE IN THE 
      SIDEWALK, where the leash is getting sucked in, faster and faster, 
      momentum building. 
      <p>Nancy tries, but cannot get her hand un-stuck from the plastic leash 
      holder as she keeps getting dragged forward ... 
      <p>She gets pulled closer to the hole in the ground when suddenly 
      SOMETHING ERUPTS from out of the sidewalk pavement. We hear a horrible 
      ROAR. 
      <p>We do not see the creature, but Nancy does. She SCREAMS, crawling back 
      as fast as she can, managing to remove her bloodied hand from the leash 
      holder just in time. 
      <p>And she gets up. Pauses in horror to hear the sounds of BONES CRUNCHING 
      beneath the ground. That's enough for her - she turns and RUNS - 
      <p>And SCREAMS again, having just run into ... 
      <p>Xander. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Uh ... Hello.</center>
<p>And we cut to: 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Nancy, looking traumatized, her hand bandaged, holds a steaming cup of 
      tea as she sits on Buffy's couch. She's mid- story. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY<br/>... And whatever it was, it was big.<br/>And strong. 
      Stronger than... I mean<br/>I don't know how it's possible. You <br/>hear 
      things, in this town, living in<br/>Sunnydale, but no one actually 
      <br/>believes them - you'd have to be <br/>crazy, and 
      ...<br/>(beat)<br/>...And you all think I'm crazy, <br/>don't you?</center>
<p>We see she is talking to Xander, Buffy and Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>I don't. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We've seen things too, Nancy. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>We're probably the only ones in<br/>Sunnydale who would believe 
      you. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>And we're gonna do something about <br/>this. It's your lucky 
      night. <br/>Considering, you know, your dog just<br/>got all ate up and 
      stuff.<br/>(beat)<br/>Can I freshen up that tea for ya? 
      <p>NANCY<br/>No, I'm good.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He gives her an understanding nod. Then when she looks away, 
      mock-smacks his own forehead. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>So you say this thing just came up <br/>out of the ground? 
      No signs, or <br/>warning of any kind? 
      <p>NANCY<br/>Just this kind of rumbling sound.<br/>You know, like before an 
      earthquake? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>"... From beneath you it devours." 
      <p>NANCY<br/>What? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Nothing. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Nothing good ... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>It's sounding monster-ific, all<br/>right. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Round up the gang? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Good thinking. Except ...<br/>(gesturing)<br/>This is the gang 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Just us. Right. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(shrugs)<br/>About as assembled as the Avengers<br/>can be 
      these days.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy nods, turns to Nancy. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>We're going to get into this. And if<br/>your dog's alive, 
      we'll find him. I<br/>promise. The only thing we need ...</center>
<p>And Buffy is cut off by a suave off-screen voice that's vaguely 
      familiar, even if the tone is not. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (O.S.)<br/>What you need is help.</center>
<p>Buffy, Xander and Dawn all look to see: 
      <p>SPIKE. Standing in the living room by the French doors, having entered 
      unnoticed. 
      <p>He's looking cool, calm and collected. Well dressed, hair neat and 
      platinum once again, well-groomed in a mod-ish kind of way, and not 
      incidentally, looking on the studly side. 
      <p>Not even a little bit crazy. Just the opposite, It's totally together 
      Spike. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Fortunately ... you've got me.</center>
<p>And off Buffy's stunned reaction, we blackout.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING 
      <p>Right where we left off: Off Buffy's face. She's looking right into the 
      eyes of Spike, who's standing in the doorway. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Buffy. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spike.</p></center>
<p>ANGLE ON: Xander, Dawn and Nancy looking on. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY<br/>Who is that? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>He's... it's Buffy's... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Ex. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>And somehow I'm getting it's more<br/>complicated than that. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Always is.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander rises to stand closer to Spike, "protecting" Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(to Spike)<br/>You've changed. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I have. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Nice clothes. Better hair. And not <br/>so much with the crazy, 
      I like it.</p></p></center>
<p>She stares hard, arms folded. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Now what do you want? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Easy. If you think I like putting<br/>myself here, surrounded 
      by people who<br/>don't particularly like me.</p></center>
<p>He makes eye contact with the glaring Xander. 
      <p>
<center>SPIRE (cont'd)<br/>... You'd be wrong. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>If you're uncomfortable, we could<br/>make you leave. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I'll be quick.<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>We need to talk. Want to do 
      that<br/>here, or privately? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I'm thinking here - in the company of<br/>good friends and 
      pointy weapons.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks back to Dawn and Nancy on the couch ... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You said something about "quick?" 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I did. For a start and for the<br/>record - last you saw me, I 
      was a<br/>mess - out of my head - admitted.<br/>Last week, living in the 
      school<br/>basement ... well you saw me.</p></center>
<p>Dawn comes over. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>You did? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Damn it, Buffy 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Wait. Guys. Yes, I saw Spike ...<br/>I just ... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What - forgot to mention it? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Things in that basement were insane.<br/>I saved your life. 
      We'll discuss <br/>this later.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander and Dawn exchange looks. Then look to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Sure. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Whatever you want. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Right, 'cause that seems to be the<br/>only time you let us in, 
      Buffy. <br/>Whenever you want. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Now, in fairness to Buffy... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Shut up, Spike. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Guys. Give us a minute.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy pulls Spike aside, out of the living room and into the foyer 
      where they speak closely, a bit more intense. Xander and Dawn return to 
      Nancy. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Don't start out by saying you're<br/>sorry. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I didn't come to atone. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Then what the hell do you want? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Only to help you. 
      <p>BUPFY<br/>Help me what? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I was kinda hoping you'd tell me.<br/>You're the Slayer. 
      Connected to <br/>visions, the long line of worthies.<br/>Riqht? I'm just a 
      guy with his ear<br/>to the ground, but even I can feel<br/>it: something's 
      coming.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy shifts, eyeing Spike hard, but paying attention. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Don't know what, exactly, but<br/>something's 
      brewing and it's so big,<br/>ugly and damned, it makes you and me <br/>look 
      like little bitty puzzle pieces.<br/>If I'm wrong - say so. Lovely. 
      No<br/>hard feeling. I go out that door and<br/>you can lock it behind me 
      with any <br/>spell you like. So.<br/>(beat)<br/>Am I wrong?</center>
<p>Buffy regards him a long time. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Everything about you is wrong, Spike. </center>
<p>Spike nods, taking it in. Without a word, he turns to go. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>But something is coming. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You're gonna need help. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Since when did you become the<br/>champion of the people? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I didn't. I'm just a guy who can<br/>lend a hand, if you let 
      me.<br/>(beat)<br/>Ball's in your court, Slayer.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike awaits her response. And off Buffy's uncertainty, we cut to: 
      <p>EXT. ENGLAND - DAY 
      <p>WILLOW is seated in the doorway of the old stone house we saw in 
      episode one. Coat on, bags packed. Giles joins her. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Your cab is here. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I know.</p></center>
<p>She doesn't move. Pause. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>And in keeping with quaint old<br/>British tradition, 
      you'll now be<br/>expected to get in it. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't think I can, Giles. I'm not<br/>done here.</p></center>
<p>Again, the horn honks. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>That's your fear talking. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yes! My fear's a big obnoxious<br/>blabbermouth - and you're 
      the one who<br/>keeps telling me to trust my<br/>instincts. 
      <p>GILES<br/>True. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>So? Shouldn't we be listening? I<br/>don't want to go back 
      home just so I<br/>can screw up again. Why don't I<br/>stay? Not forever, 
      just long enough<br/>to, I dunno, make my fear shut up a<br/>little, maybe. 
      <p>GILES<br/>It's possible, but ...</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>The taxi's horn honks. Giles motions for the taxi to wait. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>Try to be very specific. What is it,<br/>exactly, 
      you're afraid of? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Ho. Well. For starters? How about<br/>the Hellmouth's getting 
      all rumbly<br/>again and now I know it's got teeth<br/>and are those literal 
      teeth 'cause I<br/>don't know if I can handle it, and<br/>what if I 
      <i>can</i> handle it? Does that<br/>mean I have to be a bigger, 
      badder<br/>badass than the source of all<br/>badness? What if I have to give 
      up<br/>all this control stuff and go all<br/>veiny and homicidal and what if 
      ... 
      <p>GILES<br/>(quietly)<br/>... They don't take you back? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>A-huh? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Willow. We could remain another two<br/>years here, training 
      and practicing,<br/>learning to hone your powers. And<br/>still, you'd be no 
      way of knowing for<br/>sure if the friends you left behind<br/>are still 
      your friends at all.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Beat as Willow really takes this in. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Well ... sure. I mean you put it<br/>that way - 
      <i>duh</i>. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I would offer some guarantee you'll<br/>be welcomed back in 
      Sunnydale with<br/>open arms. But I can't. You may not<br/>be wanted. But 
      you will be needed. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(small)<br/>That all you got? 
      <p>GILES<br/>For the moment, yes. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Okay. Guess I'd better ... 
      <p>GILES<br/>Trust yourself. And the others might<br/>follow.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy stands in the center of the living room, issuing orders. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(as she works)<br/>We're gonna split. Two 
      pairs.<br/>Whatever this creature is, it's<br/>burrowing through solid 
      ground. That <br/>means a kind of strength and power we<br/>don't usually 
      deal with. But we may <br/>have to yet used to, now that the 
      <br/>Hellmouth's getting all perky.</center>
<p>Nancy pulls Xander aside. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY<br/>Shouldn't we call the police? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>And tell them what?</p></center>
<p>Pause. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY<br/>I'll stop interrupting. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(to Nancy)<br/>This thing came from underground, yes?</p></center>
<p>Nancy nods. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>And took your dog. Which means it<br/>could have 
      been lured. By scent,<br/>rhythm of motion ... what's your<br/>dog's name? 
      <p>NANCY<br/>Rocky. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Comes when called? 
      <p>NANCY<br/>Always does. Or, did ...</p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike nods re-assuringly. Nancy smiles at Spike. No one else does. 
      Buffy continues: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Xander. Take Nancy home. Drive,<br/>don't walk and try not 
      to stop 'til<br/>you get there. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Understood. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>(to Xander)<br/>Is your girlfriend always this 
      ...<br/>commanding? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Who - Buffy? Oh, she's not ... I<br/>mean, she's a girl, and a 
      friend, but<br/>she's not my ... 
      <p>DAWN <br/>Xander?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander looks to Dawn. She indicates he's got something at the corner of 
      his mouth. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd) <br/>Little drool? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spike and I'll check out the site of<br/>the attack. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>O-kay ...</p></p></center>
<p>Xander takes Buffy aside, speaking privately. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Buffy, in the biggest way, I am not<br/>loving 
      this plan. I'm not loving<br/>Spike. He ...<br/>(hushed, intense) <br/>He 
      tried to rape you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And failed. I know I can take him.</p></center>
<p>Xander hesitates, wanting to say more, but stops himself off Buffy's 
      look. Conversation ended. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Let's patrol. Xander's taking Nancy home. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I'm command central. Everybody<br/>checks in with 
      me.<br/>(beat)<br/>Okay, I'll be here doing homework,<br/>but still the other 
      thing sounds<br/>cooler. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Let's head out. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Righty-o, then.</p></p></p></center>
<p>They get up to go. Dawn motions to Spike. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Spike?</center>
<p>Dawn stops Spike at the door on his way out. Takes him aside. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd) <br/>You sleep, right?</center>
<p>He looks quizzical. Strange question. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>You, Vampires. You sleep. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(smiles)<br/>Yeah. What's your point, nibblet? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Well, I couldn't take you in a fight<br/>or anything, even with 
      that chip in<br/>your head. But you do sleep. And if<br/>you hurt my sister, 
      <u>at all</u>, if you<br/><u>touch</u> her -- you're gonna wake up on 
      <br/>fire.</p></p></center>
<p>Spike starts to reply. Dawn's glare continues, unbroken. Spike gets it 
      <p>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>A flashlight's beam crawls along a stretch of sidewalk. We see BUFFY 
      and Spike walking along the Sunnydale street (the site of the attack on 
      Nancy's dog). Spike walks ahead of Buffy, looking all business. Buffy 
      straggles a few paces behind, holding herself, looking unsure - 
      vulnerable. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You're awfully quiet. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I wouldn't know what to say. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Fine with me. I was more than half<br/>expecting to get an 
      earful anyway and<br/>when exactly'd your sister get<br/>unbelievably 
      scary?</p></p></center>
<p>She stops, staring at him. He stops too. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What are you doing? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>What? Told you once. Straight up.<br/>I'm here to help. And 
      that's all.<br/>(beat)<br/>Think this here's our spot?</p></center>
<p>We reveal they've come upon a patch of sidewalk that looks like it's 
      been exploded outward from the ground up. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>How'd you guess.</center>
<p>They move forward. Buffy takes her flashlight and points it downward 
      into the burst-open patch of pavement. Spike looks within. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Don't fancy sticking my head in that. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But if something bites it off, that<br/>will be a 
clue.</p></center>
<p>Spike looks back at her. Right. He leans in, investigating the gaping 
      hole as they speak. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>So, what happened to you?</center>
<p>Spike's P.O.V.: beneath the ruble, there lies a large, dark HOLE, 
      sporadically illuminated by the flashlight. No telling how deep it goes. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You saw yourself. Those ghostly <br/>types down in the 
      school basement got<br/>in my head. Made me flat-out, bug-<br/>shagging 
      crazy. And I'm not exactly<br/>bragging about it, but they were<br/>... 
      stronger than I was. Made me see <br/>things. Do things.</center>
<p>And Spike suddenly stops, turns back to Buffy, genuinely curious: 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>And how come you didn't tell anyone<br/>you saw 
      me? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Dunno. I guess ... I was partly <br/>hoping you were some kind 
      of mirage. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Sorry to disappoint. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Not your fault. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Hold the lantern closer, would you?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>But she does not move. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Buffy? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spike, I can't. I can't do this. I<br/>can't ... I don't know 
      what this is.<br/>I don't know what you want. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(sighs)<br/>At the moment, I want a little more<br/>visibility. 
      Fair?</p></p></center>
<p>He reaches out for the flashlight. Buffy hands it to him, and in that 
      moment their hands TOUCH. And the second that happens, we FLASH TO: 
      <p>FLASHBACK (STOCK) Season Six, Episode Eighteen - in the bathroom, 
      quick-cuts of Spike as he attempts to RAPE BUFFY. 
      <p>As quickly as it started, we FLASH BACK TO: 
      <p>Buffy STARING at Spike, still holding her flashlight. Spike looks back 
      to her. Knows something's wrong. Long pause. Neither moves nor speaks 
      awhile. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>This isn't ... our working together's<br/>not going to get 
      us back together.<br/>If that's what you want. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>It's not. Look. I can't blame you<br/>for being all skittish. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>"Skittish?" That's not a word I'd<br/>use for it. You tried to 
      rape me.<br/>(small)<br/>I don't have the words.</p></p></center>
<p>Spike addresses Buffy directly. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Neither do I. I can't say "sorry"<br/>and I can't use 
      "forgive me." All I <br/>can tell you, Buffy, is I've changed. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I believe you. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Well, that's something. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I just don't know what you've changed<br/>into. You come back 
      to town, you<br/>make with the big surprises -<br/>twice - and I don't know 
      what your<br/>game is, Spike, but I know - there's <br/>something you're not 
      telling me. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You're right.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>That stops her. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>There is. But we're not best 
      friends<br/>anymore, so too bad for me - I'm not <br/>sharing.</center>
<p>He steps away from the site, standing, wiping his hands on his pant 
      legs. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>We've been through things. The end<br/>of the 
      world and back. I can be <br/>useful, because honestly? I've got<br/>nothing 
      better to do. Make use of me<br/>if you want.<br/>(beat)<br/>And there's 
      nothing here. Bit of<br/>slime, mounds of displaced dirt and<br/>such. 
      Whatever our beastie is -<br/>he's gone.</center>
<p>Spike walks past Buffy She stands immobile, her face sad and unsure 
      what to do with Spike ... 
      <p>INT. APARTMENT ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
      <p>Nancy opens the front door to her apartment complex, leading Xander 
      into the main hallway. They are in mid-conversation. 
      <p>(PRODUCTION NOTE: This is the main apartment entrance, a small hallway 
      with apartment doors on each side, and a stairway at the end of this 
      hall). 
      <p>
<center>NANCY<br/>... still kinda hard to believe this<br/>is happening, 
      even with this town's<br/>reputation for, you know, 
      unexplained<br/>weirdness. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Right, "Sunnydale: come for the food,<br/>stay for the 
      dismemberment." 
      <p>NANCY<br/>There's good food?</p></p></center>
<p>Xander smiles. They hesitate. A little spark-age growing between them 
      ... 
      <p>
<center>NANCY (cont'd)<br/>Well ... thanks.<br/>(beat)<br/>And that's a 
      couple levels of<br/>lameness right there, isn't it? Me<br/>saying "thanks," 
      after all you've<br/>done tonight ... 
      <p>XANDER <br/>Well you could slip me a twenty, but<br/>then I'd have to act 
      all offended. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>Got it. So, you think I might,<br/>instead, give you a call 
      sometime? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Just to check in. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>No, I'm actually hitting on you. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Even better. I'm very listed. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>And I'm very pushy, so that works<br/>out, then.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They have that awkward shuffle people have when they're not ready to 
      hug yet, then Nancy turns to go. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY (cont'd) <br/>Night.</center>
<p>He watches her take a step - then stop - just as a RUMBLING sound 
      grows, becoming louder... 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Uh, Nancy ...?</center>
<p>The hallway lights FLICKER. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd) <br/>I just got a swell idea.</center>
<p>And just then, the glass in the door behind Xander SHATTERS as the 
      rumbling grows deafeningly loud. The wood of the doorframe SPLINTERS and 
      the floor beneath them buckles - furrowing in a deadly straight line 
      heading their way. 
      <p>Something is plowing through the ground - chasing them. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Run.</center>
<p>Xander grabs hold of Nancy and together they RUN the length of the 
      floor, heading for the stairs. The tiled floor buckles as something big 
      BURROWS its way toward them, a subterranean ROAR growing as it comes. 
      <p>They run fast - it burrows faster. Tiles buckle and crack as the wave 
      rushes toward them. 
      <p>Xander gets to the STAIRS and pushes Nancy up the first few steps, 
      following right behind her. The burrowing creature BURSTS UP through the 
      hallway floor - and we get our first good look at it. 
      <p>It's a giant, eyeless, overgrown WORM CREATURE (all mouth, teeth, and 
      very little else) with multiple rows of razor sharp teeth. It rears up out 
      of the ground, and lunges, getting close to Nancy. 
      <p>She SCREAMS. 
      <p>But the creature cannot follow up the steps or rise up any further out 
      of the ground - with a bone-rattling roar of fury and desperation, it 
      disappears back into the floor. 
      <p>And slowly, silence returns. Xander and Nancy, both breathless and 
      freaked out, check each other. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd) <br/>You okay?</center>
<p>Nancy cries, unable to handle this. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Dumb question. Are you injured? You<br/>hurt? 
      <p>NANCY<br/>I ... no, I don't think so. It's <br/>just, I don't think I can 
      take any <br/>more of this ... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(nods)<br/>Two attacks in one night - I'm <br/>thinking it's 
      more than just <br/>coincidence. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>Sure. Why not? Monster, trying to <br/>kill me ... that was 
      really the only <br/>thing missing to make my life perfect.<br/>(beat, 
      sighing)<br/>Ronnie'd love this, boy ... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Right. Who's Ronnie? 
      <p>NANCY<br/>Oh, only a psycho ex-boyfriend I <br/>spent the last few weeks 
      getting rid<br/>of. Phtt, I almost prefer the <br/>monster. He was ... 
      trouble. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Uh-huh. And, just curious here, was<br/>this Ronnie guy a 
      "borrow money" kind<br/>of trouble, or more of a "raising <br/>demon" 
      trouble kind of guy?</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They both look out to the shattered hallway floor. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY<br/>Ronnie? He couldn't - I mean, he was<br/>just... He was an 
      abusive bastard, is<br/>the catchy headline. And he'd just <br/>show up, 
      even after...<br/>(beat, numbed)<br/>You know the feeling when your ex is 
      <br/>constantly ruining every part of your <br/>life and it just doesn't 
      stop? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yes. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>And you yet so tired of being<br/>helpless, all you can do is 
      just ...<br/>wish it could all stop? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>"Wish?"</p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander closes his eyes and sighs ... 
      <p>
<center>NANCY<br/>But then I realized, it's my life,<br/>not his, why'd I 
      ever let him ... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Nancy - I'm sorry - can we go back a <br/>second? When you 
      wished, was that <br/>like wishing on a star, or did you <br/>actually wish 
      to a friend that <br/>something bad would happen?</p></center>
<p>Off Nancy's confused look, we cut to: 
      <p>INT. BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>ANYA, sitting in the bronze, sipping on a straw and listening with 
      great interest as a YOUNG WOMAN talks non-stop ... 
      <p>
<center>YOUNG WOMAN<br/>... and it's not the fact he cheated<br/>on me, it's 
      the way he cheated, you<br/>know? I mean, we could have talked,<br/>I could 
      have handled it ... 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I get it. Go<br/>on ... 
      <p>YOUNG WOMAN<br/>You know what he is? He's spineless.<br/>That's it. He's 
      like this spineless<br/>little pig.<br/>(beat)<br/>You know what I wish? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>God, do I want to.</p></p></p></center>
<p>She sips greedily on her straw, awaiting the answer ... 
      <p>Looks like the Vengeance Demon is back in business.

      <p>Where we left off: close on Anya as she drinks her drink and nods her 
      head, listening to the young woman - just as the Young Woman gets jostled 
      by a PASSERBY, distracting her: 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>... You were saying. 
      <p>YOUNG WOMAN<br/>I want more quesadillas? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Before that. 
      <p>YOUNG WOMAN<br/>A margarita? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>After that. 
      <p>YOUNG WOMAN<br/>Oh. Yeah! God, my boyfriend's <br/>spineless. He should 
      just, you know,<br/>just be spineless. For real. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>No spine. Got it. I can do that. 
      <p>YOUNG WOMAN<br/>(huh)<br/>What do you mean? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Well, honey, what I'm driving us <br/>towards here is, 
      sometimes, don't you<br/>just wish that ...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>The Young Woman looks confused as Anya interrupts herself seeing she is 
      now surrounded by Xander, Buffy, Spike and Nancy. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd) <br/>Oh, penis. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(to Nancy)<br/>This the one you talked to? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(to Young Woman)<br/>Tell you what: let's put a pin in it,<br/>go 
      get yourself a beverage and we'll <br/>pick it up in a few. 'Kay?</p></p></center>
<p>Confused, the Young Woman walks away, leaving the annoyed Anya to be 
      surrounded by her former friends. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd) <br/>You guys - I'm working here. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We noticed. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>It's why we're here. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yeah, did you turn this nice lady's<br/>ex into a giant worm 
      monster?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Long pause. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Yes. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>No way - are you saying that ... that<br/>thing was Ronnie? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Hey, you wish it, I dish it. I <br/>thought we were clear on 
      this.<br/>Didn't think you were gonna turn <br/>all narc on me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You wished your ex was a worm. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>We were just talking. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Anya has a way of making things <br/>happen. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I had a quota, the guy had it coming,<br/>what's the big? 
      <p>NANCY<br/>I think I'm gonna be sick. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Anya, that thing you created burst<br/>through solid pavement 
      and ate her <br/>dog. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Aww. Puppy ... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Wait. That gets your sad noise? <br/>People's lives are in 
      danger and you <br/>give it up for the shih-tzu? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>You never understood me, Xander. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>Xander, who is this woman? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Anya? She's ... Anya.<br/>(small)<br/>My ex. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>Oh. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Hey, nobody's bragging here.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike grabs Anya's wrist, roughly. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>Ow! Hands off the merchandise - you<br/>don't get 
      to go there again, Spike. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Please - I've already forgotten our <br/>little together time. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>I thought you were Xander's ex-<br/>girl friend. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I am. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>But you and Spike ...? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>We had a thing. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Didn't last. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>(to Spike)<br/>But weren't you Buffy's ... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Briefly. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Never serious. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>Are there any of you who haven't<br/>slept with each 
      other?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike and Xander barely glance at one another. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Well at least we're all bipeds, which <br/>is more than you 
      can say for Ronnie <br/>the worm boy. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Can we all just focus a minute?<br/>Anya. This Ronnie? He's not 
      a worm.<br/>Worms are like, this big. They're<br/>fish bait. That thing ... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Was a Sluggoth Demon.<br/>(to Anya)<br/>Am I right? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Maybe. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>But - I never wished for that. I<br/>don't even know what a ... 
      <br/>whatchamacallit demon is. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Sluggoth Demon. Very large, very<br/>nasty, natural predators 
      who died out <br/>around the Crusades. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Same phylum, it's not cheating. I<br/>just embellished. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Well you can unembellished now. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Bite me, Harris. I have rules to <br/>work with. Vengeance Demon 
      codes of<br/>conduct you'll never understand <br/>'cause you're still all so 
      ... human.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike gets deadly calm. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>I'm not. Demon like yourself, Anya<br/>. Now you turn this 
      spell around like<br/>a good little Vengeance Demon, or I<br/>... 
      what?</center>
<p>As Spike speaks, Anya's jaw nearly drops. She looks at him like he's 
      some object of fascination. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Oh my God ... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>What are you staring at?</p></center>
<p>But Anya can't stop staring at Spike. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Oh my God ... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Right - let's go. </p></center>
<p>Spike rises, but Anya holds his arm. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>How did you do it ... ? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spike. What's she talking about? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I can see you ... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Nothing. Let's go. Got some worm<br/>hunting to do ... 
      <p>ANYA<br/>How did you do it? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Shut up. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>It shouldn't be possible ... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Shut your mouth, you. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>How did you get ... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I said you shut UP!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>And Spike, unable to free himself from Anya, hauls off and PUNCHES her 
      in the face. Anya goes down hard, up-ending the table, crashing on the 
      floor. 
      <p>Spike wastes no time taking full advantage - he leaps upon the prone 
      Anya and shockingly RAINS BLOWS down upon her. Really wailing. 
      <p>Anya BACKHANDS Spike off her and rises to her feet - in full DEMON 
      FACE. Breathing heavily, pissed off. 
      <p>Spike crashes into the pool table, gets his bearings, grins. 
      <p>And (unseen by the others) Nancy freaks - physically recoiling from the 
      violence, she turns and splits, bumping into some Bronzers on her way out, 
      not stopping ... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>(to Anya)<br/>Right, bitch. Round and round we 
      ...</center>
<p>But before Spike can lunge at Anya, Buffy grabs Spike by the collar and 
      yanks him back, hard. He whips his head round to face her directly - and 
      we see he's now in full VAMP FACE. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You haven't changed, Spike.</center>
<p>He shoves her. She punches him. He punches her back. And Buffy goes 
      nuts. She launches a left-right-hook combination and punctuates it with a 
      roundhouse kick to the head. As she does so, Spike SPEAKS, almost smiling: 

      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Ooh, working out some issues, are we?<br/>Guess this'd be 
      first contact since<br/>you-know-when ... up for another<br/>round in the 
      balcony, then?</center>
<p>Enough. Buffy hits Spike hard enough to send him down hard. Spike gets 
      to his feet, all piss and swagger, facing Buffy and wiping the blood from 
      his mouth. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Right you are, Love. I haven't <br/>changed, Not 
      a lick.</center>
<p>He saunters forward, daring Buffy to hit him. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Not a slap, not a tickle, not one<br/>juicy bit. 
      I'm the same, baby, head <br/>to toe, the man you loved and hated, 
      <br/>slept with and moaned over. And <br/>watching your face trying to 
      figure <br/>me out was absolutely delicious.</center>
<p>He's gotten close enough. Buffy backhands him with a closed fist, 
      whipping his head sideways. And he comes right back. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Love the taste.</center>
<p>Angle on Xander, who's scanning the Bronze ... 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Buffy ... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Not now, Xander. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Nancy.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy stops. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>She's gone. And out there alone, <br/>she's worm 
      bait. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(realizing)<br/>I'll go find her. You work on<br/>Anya - get her 
      to reverse that spell.</p></center>
<p>Buffy exits. Spike follows after. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Is that it?!? A little touchy-feely<br/>and then you're 
      off to the batpoles?</center>
<p>Anya, back in human face, watches Spike, appalled. Xander stands beside 
      her. Spike saunters past, styling ... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Well what the hell? I want to play, <br/>too 
      ...</center>
<p>He grabs a drink off a nearby table without looking, downs it, grins at 
      Anya - and rushes out, following Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Beautiful night.</center>
<p>He goes. Xander watches him go, turns back to Anya. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Anya, we ... 
      <p>ANYA<br/>... Have nothing to talk about.</p></center>
<p>EXT. MAIN STREET SUNNYDALE - NIGHT 
      <p>We see Nancy, walking quickly down a Sunnydale street alone, obviously 
      upset. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY<br/>Freaks. Why do I always surround <br/>myself with 
      ...</center>
<p>But she trails off, hearing a slowly growing RUMBLING sound, coming 
      from behind her. Nancy slows, stops - turns. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY (cont'd) <br/>Oh, God ...</center>
<p>We see what she sees: far down the street, some tarmac erupts, and a 
      line burrows itself in her direction, coming this way and gaining speed. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY (cont'd) <br/>Oh, God ...</center>
<p>Nancy turns and RUNS. She crosses the empty night street, making her 
      way to a STORE. 
      <p>Its door closed, she makes it to the door, grabs the handle and TUGS 
      with all her might. Locked. 
      <p>The burrowing line is coming right toward her. And a subterranean ROAR 
      can be heard as well, growing ... 
      <p>Nancy bolts from the door, running to the other side of the street, 
      searching for another way out. She gets to another store's door - and the 
      burrowing line CHANGES DIRECTION, following her. 
      <p>She tries the second door, locked. 
      <p>
<center>NANCY (cont'd) <br/>Help! Somebody HELP ME! </center>
<p>She spots a FIRE ESCAPE LADDER. Bolts for it. The street buckles behind 
      her, hot on her heels. Nancy makes it to the fire escape ladder and begins 
      to climb. 
      <p>The burrowing creature below her disappears beneath the pavement. 
      Nancy, holding onto the ladder's rungs, closes her eyes and breathes a 
      sigh of relief ... 
      <p>When - BOOM! - the entire building SHUDDERS under some terrible impact. 
      Nancy looks down to see the store is being RAMMED from below - and the 
      ladder's rivets screwing it into the side of the building begin to shake 
      loose ... 
      <p>
<center>NANCY (cont'd) <br/>HELP ME!</center>
<p>EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy runs along the rooftops at night, trailing the straight line of 
      destruction in the street below her. We follow along with her as she runs 
      from rooftop to rooftop. 
      <p>She passes out of frame, eyes filled with purpose. 
      <p>And Spike (no longer in Vamp-Face) enters behind her, unseen by BUFFY, 
      following, having fun, playing like a black cat in the night ... 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (O.S.)<br/>You know this has to stop.</center>
<p>INT BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>We pick up Xander and Anya, the two of them having found a more or less 
      secluded section of the Bronze to talk. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Don't think you can tell me what to<br/>do, Xander. You're 
      not a part of my <br/>life anymore, remember? 
      <p>XANDER <br/>Acutely. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>So why are you here? Let me cast my <br/>Vengeance. Do I come to 
      where you <br/>work and slap the ... wrench thing <br/>out of your hands? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I'm trying to save your life. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>How's that work? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Think about the career choice you're<br/>making here, Anya. 
      You're getting <br/>people killed.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>This clearly affects Anya, but she steels herself: 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Not my problem. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Well it's gonna be. Forget right and <br/>wrong - what you're 
      doing is demonic. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Uh, yeah. We're not called Vengeance<br/><i>People</i> ... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>And Buffy's the Slayer. You're a<br/>Demon. You kill people - 
      how long<br/>you think it's gonna be before <br/>she has to do her job? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Buffy wouldn't slay ... me. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Not if you stop now.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Beat. Xander lets Anya sit with it. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>What do you want me to do? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Reverse the spell. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>It's not that easy, Xander! 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You can do it. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Sure, the spell part. But what about <br/>afterwards? What about 
      me? I'm in <br/>enough trouble as it is. Halfrek's <br/>all over my case, 
      D'Hoffryn is not <br/>pleased with my work and you don't <br/>want to see 
      him unhappy, trust me ... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Nice friends you got. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Nice friends I had. Chums, co-<br/>workers, bridesmaids ... oh I 
      had the <br/>whole package until something fell <br/>apart, now what could 
      that be, Xander? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You saying this is my fault? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>All I'm saying is, none of this <br/>happened until you dumped 
      me at the <br/>altar. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>And sooner or later, Anya, that <br/>excuse just stops 
      working.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He's right and she knows it. It doesn't make her comfortable. And on 
      her face we cut to: 
      <p>EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 
      <p>Nancy clings to the ladder as best she can as the building continues to 
      shudder. One last BOOM! sends the entire side of the building rocking and 
      Nancy loses her grip. 
      <p>Screaming, Nancy FALLS. 
      <p>The pavement below her BURSTS OPEN and we get a FULL VIEW of the 
      Sluggoth Demon as it RIPS out from beneath the pavement. 
      <p>Its giant hole of a mouth opens, revealing its multiple rows of teeth. 
      Nancy screams - just as BUFFY appears, swinging on a telephone line, 
      spewing sparks out of its ripped-off end. 
      <p>Buffy CATCHES Nancy, Errol Flynn-style. 
      <p>Together, the two of them swing back up, out of harm's way, when Buffy 
      lets the sputtering cable go before they ground themselves ... 
      <p>They land hard, Buffy absorbing most of the impact. 
      <p>Before Nancy can fully recover, Buffy springs to her feet, turns, and 
      rushes. 
      <p>Buffy rushes the demon, which BURSTS AGAIN from out of the pavement. It 
      SNAPS at Buffy. She leaps back, its massive jaws just missing her. 
      <p>The monster pulls under the ground, lightning fast, then BURSTS UP and 
      SNAPS again. 
      <p>Again, Buffy's a split-second too fast for it. She prepares to lunge 
      again when SPIKE appears beside her, looking all rough and tumble, 
      breaking off a piece of storefront grating. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You've had you're turn, luv.</center>
<p>Spike HITS the Demon with the pipe, using it as a bat. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Leave the real violence to the demons, 
      yeah?</center>
<p>Spike rears back with the piece of pipe like a makeshift spear ... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>That's right! Big bad's back, and <br/>looking 
      for a little <u>DEATH</u>-</center>
<p>Buffy and Nancy watch as Spike RAMS the pipe forward, into the Demon's 
      body ... 
      <p>Just as the Demon TRANSFORMS - back into the form of a human being. A 
      man. RONNIE. Mid-twenties. Filthy, naked, and confused. 
      <p>And Spike, unable to stop his momentum, STABS the helpless man STRAIGHT 
      THROUGH his upper chest (through the SHOULDER area, <u>not</u> through the 
      heart - painful not mortal). 
      <p>Ronnie screams. 
      <p>Spike recoils in horrible chip-induced AGONY. 
      <p>And on Spike's horrified, screaming, pain-wracked face in that instant, 
      we blackout. 
      <p>
<center>END OF ACT THREE</center></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></font></p></td></tr>

<tr>
<td width="90%">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREETS - CONTINUING 
      <p>Where we left off. Spike's looking horrified - standing face to face 
      with the naked man (Ronnie) he's just stabbed through. Neither moves nor 
      speaks a moment. Impossible to tell who's more shocked. Spike speaks, 
      barely a whisper: 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>I'm sorry.</center>
<p>And the quiet is ripped apart as Spike, a dumb child-like look on his 
      face, PULLS the pipe out of Ronnie's shoulder. 
      <p>
<center>RONNIE<br/>AaaAAH!</center>
<p>Ronnie collapses in agony to the street. Spike doesn't move, he just 
      looks down, bloody pipe in hand. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Right. Wrong. Wrong maneuver, not <br/>hardly helpful. 
      Christ, please help <br/>me.</center>
<p>He turns to Buffy, screams insanely loud: 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>HELP ME!</center>
<p>Buffy pushes past Spike, pulling off her coat and pressing on her cell 
      phone simultaneously 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You're not the one who needs it.<br/>He's going into shock 
      ...</center>
<p>Buffy drapes her coat over Ronnie's now-shuddering figure, dials 911. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>(into phone)<br/>I need an ambulance. Someone's 
      been<br/>stabbed. Corner of Third and <br/>Fairview.<br/>(to Ronnie)<br/>Help 
      is coming. Try not to move.</center>
<p>She looks up to Spike. He's a mess. Near tears, pressing his fist to 
      his mouth, taking small steps back and forth but going nowhere, mumbling 
      ... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Too much pain and damage, up close, <br/>right inside me. 
      All the way, deep, deep <br/>inside me ... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spike! Whatever you're doing ... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Get AWAY!</p></p></center>
<p>He steps back from Buffy, bats away at the night air with his hands, as 
      if repelling something invisible. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Do it somewhere else. I'm through <br/>with this. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Oh, Lucky Girl. Call it quits, now <br/>there's an option. If 
      only it were<br/>so easy, if only, if only and ...<br/>(to no one)<br/>... 
      What the hell are you screaming <br/>about? I can hear you, no need 
      to<br/>SHOUT!!!</p></center>
<p>This last syllable, the word "shout," extends itself into a 
      high-pitched expression of pain and anguish, nearly bringing Spike to his 
      knees. 
      <p>BUFFY watches, confused and unsure, still tending the victim. 
      <p>And suddenly, Spike is back on his feet, laughing. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>I get it, joke's on me, lotsa larfs.<br/>Bring 
      the wife and kiddies, come and<br/>see the show, 'cause it's gonna be a 
      <br/>circus.</center>
<p>He struts madly, swinging the bloody pipe like he's Gene Kelly with an 
      umbrella ... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>With fire eaters, hoops and 
      garters,<br/>elephants and BLOOD.<br/>(sad, coherent:) <br/>Gallons. Oceans. 
      Thundering <br/>rainstorms of blood and death, waste <br/>and filth, it 
      will, I promise, never <br/>ever stop and I'll be awake and <br/>alive, eyes 
      wide bloody open feeling <br/>every pinprick. This?</center>
<p>He leans in to Buffy, nearly whispering, pointing to Ronnie. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Just the beginning, love. A warm up <br/>act. The 
      headliner's really coming <br/>and when that band hits the stage, <br/>all 
      this ... ALL THIS ... will come <br/>tumbling in death and screaming 
      and<br/>horror and bloodshed.</center>
<p>He points, knowingly. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>From beneath you it devours.</center>
<p>Buffy stops tending to Ronnie and stares, shocked. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>From ... beneath ...</center>
<p>And again, the tears well up in his eyes. He stops, staring at Buffy. 
      She looks back at him with something like sympathy. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Poor Rocky.</center>
<p>Then, crying, he turns on his heels and takes off into the night, 
      building up to a RUN. Buffy, stunned, watches him go. Behind her, Anya and 
      Xander come running up, survey the scene before them. 
      <p>Nancy stands off to the side, by a storefront, watching ... 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Buffy. 
      <p>NANCY<br/>You.<br/>(to Anya)<br/>You did this. <br/>(beat)<br/>What are 
      you?</p></center>
<p>Confused and disgusted, Nancy backs away from the scene. Xander 
      instantly moves to Buffy's side, helping and commenting: 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>She's not calling me.</center>
<p>Anya looks at the nearly-dying man on the ground. The sound of an 
      AMBULANCE SIREN comes closer. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Stay with him. Make sure he gets<br/>help. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Where are you going?</p></center>
<p>Without answering, Buffy turns and leaves, following Spike's direction. 
      Xander and Anya tend to Ronnie. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd) <br/>(to Anya)<br/>You do know you did the right 
      thing<br/>here. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(re: Ronnie)<br/>Tell him that. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You reversed the spell. Took some<br/>guts. And I know this is 
      bad - but <br/>it could be worse.</p></p></center>
<p>Anya looks up to the sky as if looking for something to appear. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA <br/>Oh. It will be. </center>
<p>Xander looks to her, but she offers no explanation as the sound of the 
      ambulance siren grows louder ... 
      <p>EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
      <p>A CEMETERY. It's dark, long shadows cast from headstones. Buffy comes 
      running into the cemetery, stops. 
      <p>She looks around, searching. 
      <p>But the place is empty. Buffy turns to go, then stops. She looks back 
      to the sole source of light casting these long headstone shadows ... 
      <p>Buffy's P.O.V.: We see, at the far end of the graveyard, a solitary 
      CHURCH. A single light comes from within. 
      <p>Buffy stares at it a moment, some kind of peace coming over her. Then 
      she walks toward the church ... 
      <p>INT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
      <p>Twin heavy doors swing slowly open and Buffy enters the church. She 
      hears the sound of sobbing. 
      <p>She walks in, cautiously, drawing a stake. 
      <p>Buffy's P.O.V.: We see a figure, its back to us, sitting in one of the 
      pews, rocking gently back and forth. 
      <p>Buffy approaches. It is Spike, sitting alone, looking as lost and 
      frightened as he can. He speaks softly and sanely. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>I figured it out. Took awhile, yeah,<br/>but ... I think 
      the real problem<br/>is ...</center>
<p>He looks to Buffy, eyes wide, vulnerable, 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>I was once this really nice guy.</center>
<p>Buffy remains cautious, keeping her distance. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>So that's the problem. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I think. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Got news, Spike. You're not that <br/>nice.</p></p></center>
<p>Spike laughs, quietly, enjoying the irony of a good joke. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Yeah. I've been ... well come on,<br/>Let's face it, been 
      a one-man <br/>slaughterhouse, last hundred years. <br/>Raping. Murdering. 
      And for what?<br/>(heat)<br/>Kicks.</center>
<p>He stands in the pew, bows his head in reverence. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>William the Bloody awful poet, <br/>skipping 
      down the lane ... good boy, <br/>bad boy, all the sodding same. <br/>You 
      like it? Wrote that one myself.</center>
<p>He rolls his head around slowly, up to the ceiling, staring. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Is it hot enough in here to burn all <br/>your 
      mortal sins away?</center>
<p>And suddenly, vampire-fast, he stands straight up. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Or am I just crazy?</center>
<p>He laughs, steps from the pew, into the aisle. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Stuffy. Stuffed. Full, packed, <br/>sorry mate, 
      no room, out you go, <br/>we're packed to the bloody brim, <br/>standing 
      room only and no room for <br/>that. We. Are. Full.</center>
<p>Buffy steps back, giving him a wide berth. Spike lurches forward, up 
      the church aisle, zig-zagging left and right, but always moving forward. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Full of sin. Full of guilt. Full of <br/>hate and 
      love and loss and feeling. <br/>Full of it, quite frankly and it's <br/>been 
      so long.<br/>(laughs)<br/>Since we felt anything here. Rusty 
      <br/>switchboard, sparked to life, bound <br/>to be more'n a few sharp 
      shocks.</center>
<p>Buffy slowly following behind, never losing grip on that stake, and 
      watching ... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Right? RIGHT?!? Shh. Quiet. <br/>Church. His 
      house. Place of clasped <br/>hands, reverent hymns, and massive <br/>raw 
      amounts of BEGGING. On your <br/>knees, boy. Beg him. BEG HIM ...</center>
<p>And we see where Spike is heading: at the head of the altar, there 
      stands a large, carved-stone CRUCIFIX. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>... for forgiveness. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spike ... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Buffy. I can't sleep. Can't think.<br/>There's voices and 
      darkness and<br/>blindness and pain and help me, I<br/>I...</p></p></center>
<p>He keeps walking, slowly, up the aisle. Gets to the altar's steps and 
      keeps going ... straight to the cross. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You have a soul.</center>
<p>Spike stops at the cross. Responds without looking back. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>I do indeed.</center>
<p>He wearily lets his head rest upon the stone crucifix. And STEAM rises 
      from where his flesh makes contact. He grimaces, but does not scream. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>And it's killing me.</center>
<p>He reaches out and HUGS the crucifix with both arms. Steam rises from 
      his palms. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>God ...</center>
<p>He releases the cross, slowly pulling back and turning to Buffy 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>God hates me. You hate me. I hate <br/>myself 
      more than ever.</center>
<p>Buffy wants to step forward but does not. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>But why'd you do it ...? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You know why. I got my soul back ... </p></center>
<p>He keeps turning, now facing Buffy, barely able to stand on his feet, 
      wobbling a bit - and holding his arms out wide. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>... So I could be the kind of ... 
      <br/>(laughs)<br/>... <i>Person</i> ... you could care for, <br/>the man you 
      would come to ... the man<br/>you could love.</center>
<p>Spike GRINS through bloody teeth. The burn marks stand out fresh upon 
      his forehead and palms. He looks like death, and any second he's going to 
      collapse. 
      <p>And still, it's like something terribly sad is actually, deep down 
      funny - and only he gets the joke. 
      <p>He walks toward Buffy. Staggering gently. Eyeing the stake she still 
      holds in her hand. He's drawn to it - and to her. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>I was the enemy, then I was nothing,<br/>and now 
      I'm God's garbage, not even<br/>a joke, less than, less than, less<br/>than 
      all His creatures combined so<br/>tell me, dear Buffy ...</center>
<p>Buffy lets him approach, unmoving, but not letting go of that stake, 
      either. 
      <p>He barely makes it to her - and SLAMS straight down, to his KNEES. And 
      opens his arms wide. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>How ya like me now?</center>
<p>Buffy's mind goes a long way trying to come up with the answer, but her 
      mouth cannot speak and we: 
      <p>
<div align="right">BLACK OUT.</div>
<p>
<center><u>END OF SHOW</u></center>
