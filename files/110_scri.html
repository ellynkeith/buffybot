<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE -LIVING ROOM - DAY 
      <p>It's early morning. DAWN and TARA, who fell asleep on the couch in 
      front of the TV, wake. Look around groggily. A happy cartoon plays on the 
      television. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>What time is it?</center>
<p>Tara checks her watch 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>Almost seven. God, I just closed my<br/>eyes for a minute- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(re: TV)<br/>-and now there's cartoons.<br/>(shifts 
      uncomfortably)<br/>Plus, I have the mother of all-night<br/>wedgies. 
      <p>TARA<br/>(very concerned)<br/>Uh oh. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's not tragic. I'm sure as soon as<br/>I stand up- 
      <p>TARA<br/>No, Dawn - why didn't anyone wake us <br/>up? Where is 
      everyone?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 
      <p>Dawn and Tara peer through the doorway into Buffy's room. See her made 
      bed. Then Dawn moves to the open door of Willow's room. Tara, 
      uncomfortable, hangs back. Dawn pokes her head into Willow's room - sees 
      that it, too, is empty and the bed is made. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Willow didn't come home either. <br/>(anxious)<br/>They were 
      out all night. Where are <br/>they?</center>
<p>Tara moves to Dawn. Puts a reassuring hand on her, trying to hide her 
      own concern. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>I'm sure they're fine, Dawny. I'm sure <br/>they just... 
      lost track of time.</center>
<p>INT./EXT. BASEMENT OF WRECKED BUILDING - DAY 
      <p>We MOVE ACROSS a heap of rubble that lies in the basement of the 
      abandoned building where we last saw Spike and Buffy. The floor and much 
      of the house collapsed into the basement, allowing patches of sunlight to 
      stream into the wreckage... 
      <p>Now BUFFY sits up out of the debris, awake. Her hair is a "morning 
      after" mess and her torn top barely covers her enough to be TV safe... 
      She's got a few serious scratches and bruises, and she looks dazed, 
      disoriented. 
      <p>A beat, and SPIKE also sits up. His lower half is hidden by debris, his 
      upper half most definitely naked. He also looks out-of-it, spun. And he 
      also has his fair share of battle scars. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>When... When did the building fall down? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Dunno. Musta been sometime between <br/>the first time and 
      the...</p></center>
<p>Spike tries to remember how many times, exactly. Buffy's eyes widen. 
      It's all coming back to her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh.<br/>(then)<br/>Oh my God.</center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT./EXT. WRECKAGE OF BUILDING - DAY 
      <p>Back in the down and dirty with Buffy and Spike. Buffy, blouse buttoned 
      and skirt now on, searches the debris anxiously. She moves like she's been 
      through the fight of her life, stiff and sore. Spike, still appearing 
      quite naked, stays reclined in the rubble, watching her in that way he 
      does. He's in deep. Deeper, now. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Shoe. I need my shoe. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>What's the hurry, luv? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The hurry is, I left Dawn all night <br/>and don't call me 
      "luv." 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(stung)<br/>Didn't seem to take issue with it<br/>last night. Or 
      with any of the other <br/>little nasties we whispered.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy takes this in, freaking. Last night. SO wrong. And SO completely, 
      mind-numbingly wild. Everything she's needed. Escape. Release. Ecstasy. 
      With Spike. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Can we - not? Talk?</center>
<p>Spike can't hide his disappointment at her attitude. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>I just don't see why you have to run <br/>off so quick. I 
      thought we could... 
      <p>BUFFY,br&gt; Not gonna happen. Last night was the<br/>end of this freak 
      show-</p></center>
<p>Spike's expression hardens and he sits up and catches Buffy by the 
      wrists, yanking her toward his naked self. She holds herself away from 
      him. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Don't say that. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What do you think is going to happen, <br/>Spike? We're gonna 
      read the paper <br/>together? Play footsie under the... 
<br/>rubble?</p></center>
<p>Spike's hand disappears below frame, starts caressing her. She looks 
      affected, despite herself. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Not exactly what I had in mind.</center>
<p>Buffy weakens for a beat. Then she finds her resolve, HITS HIS hand 
      away. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Stop- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Make me.</p></center>
<p>He moves to touch her again, she hits him away again. They end up in a 
      tussle, sexual tension building until they can't take it. They kiss - it 
      heats up faster than a microwave. Goddamn. She lies on top of him - feels 
      him respond - which SHOCKS her back to herself. She pulls away. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>No. No. I have to... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Stay. I'm stuck here. Sun's up.</p></center>
<p>They're both drunk with it. Hot, pressing against each other. They kiss 
      again. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh, God...</center>
<p>Spike whispers- 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>I knew. I knew - the only thing better <br/>than killing a 
      slayer would be fuc-</center>
<p>Buffy, alarmed, cuts him off - jerks away from him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What? That's what this was about?<br/>"Doing" a slayer? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Wouldn't throw stones, pet. You seem <br/>to be quite the 
      groupie yourself.</p></center>
<p>Infuriated, Buffy pushes off him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Shut up- 
      <p>SPIKE <br/>I'm just saying, vampires get you hot- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No. <u>A</u> vampire got me hot. <u>One</u>. But he's gone. 
      <br/>You're just convenient.</p></p></center>
<p>This hits Spike like a slap in the face. His expression goes cold. 
      Unembarrassed, he stands up. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Before you go voicing any more of<br/>your theories, you 
      might do well to <br/>remember that I can hurt you now. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Right. Because I came back all <br/>wrong... Know what's really 
      wrong <br/>with me? You.</p></center>
<p>Spike, furious, finds his own pants, steps into them. (We'll use cuts 
      to Buffy and such to make all this tasteful, I'm sure.) 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>So, what? You go back to treating me <br/>like dirt until 
      the next time you get <br/>an itch you can't scratch?</center>
<p>Buffy ignores him, still searching for her other shoe 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Well, forget it. Things changed last 
      night.<br/>I'm done being your whipping boy. 
      <p>BUFFY <br/>Nothing changed. It was a mistake- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Bullocks. It was a bloody <br/>revelation. You can act as high 
      and <br/>mighty as you like, but I know where <br/>you live now, Slayer. I 
      tasted it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Get a grip, Spike. Like you're God's<br/>gift-</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy sees her shoe, moves to it, but Spike is on her - his tone dead 
      certain. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Hardly. Wouldn't be nearly as <br/>interesting, would 
      it?</center>
<p>He's right again. They're locked on to one another now. The energy 
      between them buzzing. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Let me go- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I may be dirt, but you're the one who <br/>wants to roll in it, 
      slayer. You <br/>never had it so good as me. Never.</p></center>
<p>Buffy takes this in, shaken. It's true. She shakes him off. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You're bent- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Yeah. And it made you scream, didn't<br/>it?</p></center>
<p>Buffy, freaked, backs away from him. Her tone deadly. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I swear, if you ever tell anyone <br/>about this, <u>I 
      will kill you</u>.</center>
<p>Spike sobers, getting the seriousness of her threat. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Right.</center>
<p>A beat. Then he lifts her lacy panties. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>You gonna want these too?--</center>
<p>SMASH. Buffy' s hand comes into frame and clocks him. She moves out 
      into the light, leaving him stranded. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
      <p>Tara and Dawn, both worried, prepare breakfast - trying for some 
      normalcy. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>Pancakes? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Uh, sure.<br/>(then)<br/>Should we call Xander? What if 
      <br/>they're all in a ditch somewhere? <br/>Ditches are bad. Mom always used 
      to<br/>talk about the ditches- 
      <p>TARA<br/>Nobody's in a ditch. We'll call, but <br/>let's give it a little 
      more time <br/>before we wake them up.<br/>(re: pancakes)<br/>Funny shapes 
      or-</p></p></center>
<p>The back door opens and WILLOW AND AMY come rolling in, looking worse 
      for their night out. They are in mid-talk. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>...that last guy, I couldn't believe <br/>what you did. 
      How's he going to eat? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It'll probably wear off in a day or-</p></center>
<p>Willow stops. Sees Tara at the stove. The air is immediately thick with 
      tension. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>(to Tara)<br/>Hey. 
      <p>TARA<br/>Hey. I just... Buffy didn't come<br/>home. Either. 
So...</p></center>
<p>Tara glances at Amy, devastated at the sight of this chick Willow 
      brought home. She has no idea who she is. Willow picks up on it. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Oh. Hey! This is Amy. Amy, Tara.<br/>Tara, Amy. 
      <p>AMY<br/>(to Tara) <br/>How you doing? 
      <p>TARA<br/>(not getting it)<br/>Fine. I...<br/>(moves to leave) I'd better 
      g-get going. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Amy. Amy the <u>rat</u>.<br/>(to Amy)<br/>Sorry. 
      <p>AMY<br/>No. That's fair. I was a rat.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Tara looks at Amy with amazement. Then to Willow. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>When...</center>
<p>Willow's about to answer, but Amy beats her to the punch, talking fast, 
      a little hyper... 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Last night. It's nuts. Everything's <br/>so different. I 
      mean, the Bronze for <br/>one thing... And Willow! She's a <br/>freakin' 
      amazing witch now. I <br/>couldn't keep up with her last night-</center>
<p>Tara's expression hardens. Will sees this. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Amy- 
      <p>AMY<br/>It's true. I mean, I can do some <br/>transmogrify, but she's 
      messing with <br/>dimensions and everything. It was <br/>awesome. This 
      blowhard dude? First <br/>she made his mouth disappear, thank <br/>God, 
      and-<br/>(off Tara's stare)<br/>-I'm talking too much. Sorry. But <br/>it's 
      just, you know, been me and a<br/>bag of pellets for the last few 
      years<br/>so- 
      <p>TARA<br/>No. It's fine. It's just... I<br/>really do have to go.</p></p></center>
<p>Upset, Tara heads for the front door, via the dining room. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Tara, wait, you left some clothes and<br/>stuff. I saved 
      them for- 
      <p>TARA<br/>I'll get them later.</p></center>
<p>Tara keeps going. Bumps into BUFFY who is just corning in. Buffy looks 
      pretty wrecked, bruised and limping. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Tara-</center>
<p>But she's gone, leaving Will upset. Before Buffy can comment, Dawn is 
      all over her. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Buffy! Where were you? Are you okay?</center>
<p>Buffy can barely look at them. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I'm fine- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You're not. You're all limpy and <br/>sore-</p></center>
<p>Buffy looks both alarmed and guilty at this. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I'm not. Sore. I just had a... <br/>fight, all-nighter 
      kind of deal. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Figured. I knew that's why you <br/>didn't call. (then)<br/>So 
      what's the big bad? Should we be <br/>worried? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No. I think you guys are safe.<br/>(changing subject)<br/>Tara 
      was here. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I guess she stayed over with Dawn. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You guess? Where were you? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>We were out. We kinda lost track of<br/>time and... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I mean, I never would have if we <br/>thought you weren't 
      coming home- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, I know. It's... I mean, it <br/>wasn't intentional. And 
      everybody's safe. (to Dawn)<br/>You are, right? You're okay? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Yeah. I mean, I think my pancakes are <br/>burning, 
but-</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Now they notice some smoke coming from the grill. Willow moves to the 
      stove. Shuts it off. Stares at Tara's handywork for a beat too long. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Tara was making... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I - I've got to get some sleep. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Me too. I'm kind of... 
      <p>AMY<br/>Yeah. I should get home. Dad's <br/>expecting me. He promised to 
      save me <br/>a bunch of melon rinds and stuff for <br/>breakfast.<br/>(off 
      their looks)<br/>Kidding. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Okay. I'll call you later? 
      <p>AMY <br/>Yeah. Good.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Amy leaves. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>You sure you're alright? I'm sorry.<br/>About 
      everything. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's okay. Go get some rest. You're<br/>beat from monster 
      wrestling all <br/>night.</p></center>
<p>Buffy tries not to dwell on the unintentional entendre. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Right. Thanks.</center>
<p>She gives Dawny a weak smile and heads out. Willow follows. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Yeah. I'm going to crash too. Night<br/>Dawny.</center>
<p>Both Buffy and Willow exit, leaving Dawn alone with her burnt 
      breakfast. Dawn looks a little lost. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>No problem. I'll just... go find<br/>some awake 
      people.</center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - WILLOW'S ROOM - DAY 
      <p>Willow, exhausted and sad, enters the room and lies down. It's too 
      light - so she sits up and raises a hand toward the curtains. 
      <p>
<center>

<p>Nothing. Finally, Willow gets up and draws the curtains herself. Then 
      she lies back down, looking a little concerned. Why isn't her magic 
      working? 
      <p>INT. MAGIC BOX - DAY 
      <p>It's later. Buffy, XANDER and ANYA are researching. Buffy's at the 
      counter, trying to lose herself in work. While Xander and Anya are at the 
      table, surrounded by books. Xandertosses one into the pile, frustrated. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>These demons are all starting to look <br/>alike. 
      Reptile, reptile with horn, <br/>reptile with gills... 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(nose in her book)<br/>Hmmmmm. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>And I'm still finding nothing of the <br/>"steal a diamond, 
      freeze a guy"<br/>variety.<br/>(sighs/then)<br/>Ayn. Hand me that one next to 
      you.</p></p></center>
<p>Anya's too engrossed to hear him. She doesn't budge 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Great. We're not even married yet and you've 
      <br/>already stopped listening<br/>to me...</center>
<p>Xander leans across the table and pulls the book to him. A BRIDAL 
      MAGAZINE falls out of it. Anya looks up from behind her book, sheepish. 
      Xander SNATCHES the tome out of her hand - she's got another BRIDAL 
      MAGAZINE hidden behind her book. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Anya! 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I'm sorry, but this is pointless! <br/>We've been researching 
      forever and <br/>we're not even close to finding out <br/>who robbed that 
      museum-</p></center>
<p>Now Buffy wanders over, drawn by their squabbling. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What's up? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Anya's got a theory. Martha Stewart<br/>froze that guy- 
      <p>ANYA Don't be ridiculous! Martha Stewart<br/>isn't a 
      demon!<br/>(authoritative) <br/>She's a witch. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Please, as if she- <br/>(stops)<br/>Really? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Of course. Nobody can do that much <br/>decoupage without 
      calling on the <br/>powers of darkness- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hey. This is fascinating, really, <br/>but we've got work to 
      do- 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I certainly do. I still haven't <br/>decided whether to put my 
      bridesmaids <br/>in cocktail dresses or the<br/>traditional burlap and blood 
      larva- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>The traditional what? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I was a demon for a thousand years, <br/>Xander. You can't just 
      expect me to <br/>turn my back on all the ways of my <br/>people- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Can I weigh in on the whole me <br/>wearing of larva- 
      <p>ANYA &amp; XANDER<br/>(together)<br/>No! 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(to Xander)<br/>At least I'm not asking you to <br/>perform the 
      groom's rite of self- <br/>flagellation- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Guys! Please. There's something out<br/>there- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>There is. And much as I hate to<br/>admit that my bizarre 
      bride-to-be has<br/>a point - we're getting nowhere, Buff. <br/>Maybe it's 
      time to try something new. <br/>Hit the streets. Get Spike on it-</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy reacts a little too strongly to this suggestion. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>No. No Spike. And we don't need to <br/>hit streets. We 
      just need to stay <br/>put, away from... distractions.<br/>We'll figure it 
      out. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>What about Willow? Can't she do<br/>something? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Maybe, but she's home sleeping. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Sleeping? She sick? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>She was out late. With Amy. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(to Xander)<br/>And I'm bizarre? At least I didn't <br/>dump you 
      to hang out with an ex-rat. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's not like that. Willow's just... <br/>trying to help Amy 
      through the <br/>transition- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>And make herself a new playmate to do <br/>magic with. Someone 
      who won't<br/>monitor her, like Tara- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Willow's a grown up. Maybe she <br/>shouldn't be monitored- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So you think Tara was wrong? To<br/>leave- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I didn't say that, I just...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy, agitated, continues - and as she works herself up, it becomes 
      clear that she's talking as much about herself as she is about Willow. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I just think we should stop talking <br/>about 
      Willow this way. Okay, she's <br/>going through something. But we're 
      <br/>not her, you know? I mean, maybe she <br/>has reasons she's acting this 
      way... <br/>And what if she has crossed a line? <br/>We all do stuff. Stupid 
      stuff. And, <br/>then we learn. We learn and we don't <br/>do it again. I 
      mean, really, who are <br/>we to be all judgey?</center>
<p>Buffy stops - realizing that she's been in monologue mode. Anya and 
      Xander watching her, a little perplexed at her outburst. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Not judgey, Buff. Just observey. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Yeah. All we're saying is - she's <br/>acting different. She 
      isn't herself.</p></center>
<p>EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow, dressed a little edgier than we're used to seeing her, is 
      heading out for another night with Amy. They move down Sunnydale's main 
      drag, turning heads. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>God, I'm so glad you called. I had<br/>to get out of the 
      house. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Already? So, things with your dad... 
      <p>AMY<br/>Bizarre. I guess after I disappeared <br/>he just decided to 
      start over. He's, <br/>like, this new guy with a new wife<br/>and a new 
      baby. And I'm this reminder<br/>of all his old stuff. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What did you tell him? I mean, about<br/>where you were? 
      <p>AMY<br/>I didn't think he'd buy the rat <br/>thing, so I told him I got 
      abducted<br/>by aliens.<br/>(off Willow's stare) <br/>Kidding! God, what's 
      up? Did <br/>sarcasm die while I was a rodent? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Sorry. It's just, I guess I didn't <br/>expect you to be in a 
      jokey mood.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Amy's eyes flash angrily. We see a hint of the anarchy that's boiling 
      under her skin. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>I want to have fun, Willow. I've<br/>been in a <u>cage</u>. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(guiltily)<br/>There was a little ball. And you <br/>seemed to 
      enjoy playing with those <br/>cardboard toilet paper rolls- 
      <p>AMY<br/>As cages go, it was fine. But I was <br/>still confined. I've got 
      lost time <br/>to make up - and if people don't get <br/>it, screw 
      them.</p></p></center>
<p>Willow takes this in, relating. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Well, I do. Get it. Totally. 
      <p>AMY<br/>So what do you want to do? Gonna be<br/>hard to top last night. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah, I don't even think I can. I <br/>felt awful today. And I 
      couldn't do <br/>magic. It took all day for my powers <br/>to come back... 
      We should probably <br/>take it easy. 
      <p>AMY<br/>I've got a better idea. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What? 
      <p>AMY<br/>There's this guy. He knows spells <br/>that last for days. And 
      the burn-out <br/>factor is, like, nothing.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow takes this in, intrigued 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Really? He's a warlock? 
      <p>AMY<br/>I guess. But I'm not kidding you, this <br/>guy will blow your 
      mind. He'll take you <br/>places you can't even imagine. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Is it dangerous?</p></p></center>
<p>Amy grins. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Would that stop you?</center>
<p>EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
      <p>Now Amy and Willow are walking in a bad part of town. Definitely 
      creepy. Amy senses something, stops in front of a dirty alley. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>This is it. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Where? I thought you said the guy <br/>lived around here. 
      <p>AMY<br/>He does. You can't feel it? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What do you-</p></p></p></center>
<p>Amy takes Willow's hand and raises it. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Here.</center>
<p>Willow starts at something she feels, unseen by us. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>It's... hot. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Come on.</p></center>
<p>With that, Amy STEPS THROUGH AN INVISIBLE PORTAL and disappears. Scared 
      and excited, Willow takes a deep breath and follows suit. 
      <p>INT. DEALER'S PLACE - OUTER ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow and Amy EMERGE THROUGH THE PORTAL into a dingy two room 
      apartment. The first room functions as a waiting room, with tattered 
      couches and a couple of old chairs. A few strung-out looking folks hang on 
      the couches, eyeing the fresh-faced girls suspiciously as they enter. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Isn't that cool? His place is<br/>cloaked. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(nervously)<br/>Yeah.. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Moves all the time, too. Keeps Rack<br/>out of trouble. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Rack? Whose-</p></p></p></center>
<p>She stops as the door to the second room opens and RACK, A 
      SCARY-LOOKING WARLOCK, steps into the room. He has fucked-up eyes and dark 
      magical energy crackles from the ends of his fingers. He's simultaneously 
      repulsive and seductive. Physically, he's no looker. But his vibe is nasty 
      and powerful. As soon as he steps into the room, the jonesing folks start 
      pleading with him- 
      <p>
<center>JONESING GIRL<br/>Rack, it's my turn- 
      <p>JONESING GUY<br/>No, man, you said I was up- 
      <p>JONESING GIRL<br/>Bull! I've been here for hours-</p></p></center>
<p>He raises a hand and the jonesing pair falls silent. Rack is locked 
      onto Willow and Amy. He moves toward them, leering. 
      <p>
<center>RACK<br/>I believe these two were next.</center>
<p>Off Willow, trembling, eyes wide... 
      <p>
<div align="right">BLACK OUT.</div>

<td width="90%">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. DEALER'S PLACE - INNER ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Now we're in Rack's inner sanctum. It's a trip room. Wild paintings on 
      the walls and soft pillows allover the floor. This is a place to get high 
      and stay high. Rack is totally focused on an anxious Willow, even when 
      he's talking to Amy, his eyes barely leave her... 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Thanks, Rack, for taking us. I know <br/>it's been a while. 
      You'll never <br/>believe- 
      <p>RACK<br/>You were a rat. 
      <p>AMY<br/>How did you-</p></p></center>
<p>Rack stops her with a look. How does he know anything? 
      <p>
<center>RACK<br/>Hope it taught you not to mess with <br/>spells you can't 
      handle. You should <br/>leave that in the hands of a 
      <br/>professional.</center>
<p>He rubs his hands together thoughtfully. Energy crackles. He looks back 
      to Willow. 
      <p>
<center>RACK (cont'd)<br/>This one is giving off vibes.</center>
<p>Willow responds anxiously 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I don't mean to. Vibe at you. If<br/>it's in a negative 
      way- 
      <p>RACK<br/>I mean you have power, girl. Coming<br/>off you in waves. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Not so much. I mean, I can do stuff. <br/>But I get tapped out 
      quick. And I've <br/>used practically every spell I know- 
      <p>RACK<br/>And what do you want me to do about<br/>it? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(sweating)<br/>I don't know. I thought... Amy said- 
      <p>RACK<br/>Amy said I could help you - but did <br/>she say how <u>you</u> 
      could help <u>me</u>?</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Now Rack starts to move closer to her, his energy both sexual and 
      menacing... 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>No. I have money, a little, but- 
      <p>RACK<br/>Not money. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(hopefully)<br/>Well maybe I could help you with your 
      <br/>computer. I'm pretty handy with-</p></p></center>
<p>Rack reaches a hand toward her - Willow flinches. Moves back. 
      <p>
<center>RACK<br/>Relax. I'm not going to hurt you. <br/>But you have to give 
      a little to get <br/>a little, right?</center>
<p>Willow glances at Amy, who nods and whispers- 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>It's okay. It's over fast.</center>
<p>Willow's terrified - but she submits as Rack reaches toward her 
      again... 
      <p>
<center>RACK<br/>That's right. I'm just going to take<br/>a little 
      tour.</center>
<p>Rack places his hand on Willow's upper chest. As soon as he makes 
      contact, there is a magical BURST OF WHITE LIGHT AND SOUND, and WILLOW 
      goes RIGID. Rack closes his eyes - drinks her in. Delicious... After a 
      long beat, he lets her go. 
      <p>Willow looks HIGH. Freaked out. Rack smiles, still savoring the 
      experience. He leans close to her ear, whispers. 
      <p>
<center>RACK (cont'd)<br/>You taste like strawberries.</center>
<p>Off WILLOW, shaking. 
      <p>INT. DEALER'S PLACE - INNER ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>It's later. Music is playing. Willow is nowhere in sight. Wasted on 
      magic, Amy dances in the center of the room. Rack is watching, 
      occasionally moving a hand - doing subtle spells... Amy spins to the 
      music, faster and faster - until she is just a whirling BLUR. 
      <p>We PAN UP and find WILLOW ON THE CEILING. She's wasted, lolling there, 
      pinned to it, then moving, crawling across it... 
      <p>CLOSE ON WILLOW'S EYES 
      <p>WHAT SHE SEES 
      <p>The room beneath her becomes organic. Rack and Amy are not in sight as 
      chairs and tables grow into trees - very "WhereThe Wild Things Are." It's 
      stunning. 
      <p>ON WILLOW 
      <p>Eyes closed, a small SMILE playing across her lips... 
      <p>WHAT SHE SEES 
      <p>The room is A LIVING, BREATHING FOREST. It's incredibly beautiful - 
      until we see, in the very corner of the frame, almost unnoticed, something 
      move. We look closer. A pair of LIMP NAKED FEMALE LEGS are dragged behind 
      a tree. We look closer. A nightmarish DEMON, with slick black fur, blood 
      stained teeth and red-eyes, SPRINGS AT CAMERA. 
      <p>ON WILLOW 
      <p>Who STARTS and falls off the ceiling. She lands with a thud. Breath 
      knocked out of her. Closes her eyes. We move closer. 
      <p>Then, suddenly, in a morphy effect, Willow MOVES INCREDIBLY FAST and we 
      MOVE WITH HER. She's just a blur. Then she STOPS ON A DIME. Looks around. 
      <p>INT. BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow, breathless, is now standing in the Bronze. WHOOSH! It happens 
      again. She's RACING, a blur. 
      <p>EXT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT Now she STOPS again. She's standing on the 
      street in front of the Magic Box, looking FREAKED. WHOOSH! She SPEEDS 
      again. 
      <p>INT. BUrry'S HOUSE - WILLOW'S ROOM - DAY 
      <p>Willow STOPS ON A DIME AGAIN. Opens her eyes and she's in the exact 
      same position she was in on the floor of Rack's place. Except now she's 
      home. In the same clothes. She sits up, dizzy, disoriented, feeling like 
      hell. It's now eleven in the morning. 
      <p>A beat as Willow remembers the night before. She looks shaken. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 
      <p>The shower runs hot, smoking the mirrors and glass. Willow stands under 
      the water, hands against the wall, holding her shaking body steady... She 
      starts to cry. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - WILLOW'S ROOM - DAY 
      <p>Willow, red-eyed, wrapped in a bathrobe, steps gingerly from the 
      bathroom into the bedroom - moves to the bed. Stops. By the bed is a BOX 
      FULL OF CLOTHES LABELLED "TARA." Willow's expression shifts. Grief. 
      <p>She lifts the clothes. Smells them. Buries her face in them. Then she 
      lays them on the bed. 
      <p>Willow lies down next to the clothes and waves a hand. Slowly the 
      clothes take on form and life of their own, as if Tara is in them but not 
      seen. Willow embraces them - and they embrace her back. 
      <p>
<div align="right">FADE TO:</div>
<p>EXT. SUNNYDALE - EVENING 
      <p>Dusk falls in Sunnydale. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn stands at the stove in front a hot frying pan. She flips a folded 
      tortilla with her fingers. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Ow, ow, ow- 
      <p>WILLOW (O.C.)<br/>Or you could do it the hard way.</p></center>
<p>Dawn turns to see Willow, now dressed, but still looking sad and shaky, 
      entering the kitchen. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Spatulas are for wimps.<br/>(then)<br/>I'm making peanut 
      butter and banana <br/>quesadillas. You want?</center>
<p>Willow pours herself a glass of water. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>No thanks. I'm more in water mode.</center>
<p>Dawn flips the tortilla onto a plate. Again with the fingers. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Ow, ow... You sure? It's my own<br/>brand new invention. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm sure. My tummy's feeling a <br/>little rumbly. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(through her bite)<br/>Yorrr losshh. Very 
      deelshioush...<br/>(then)<br/>Buffy called. She's going straight <br/>from 
      the Magic Box to do some<br/>patrolling. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh. Did she need help? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>No, she was just checking in. For, <br/>like, the tenth time 
      today. I think <br/>she's feeling all Joan Crawford <br/>'cause of last 
      night. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>About that... I'm really sorry. I <br/>shouldn't have assumed 
      Buffy would be <br/>here.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Dawn tries to play it off, the grown up 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Right. Assume and make "u" an "ASS"<br/>out of "ME". Or... 
      something.<br/>(quickly)<br/>Anyway. Please. It's cool. I mean, <br/>it's not 
      like I even needed Tara to <br/>stay with me. I'm so totally fine <br/>being 
      here on my own.<br/>(then/smaller)<br/>But you are going to be around 
      <br/>tonight, right?</center>
<p>Willow brightens a little. Liking the idea of some wholesome hanging 
      out. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Right. Totally. We could do something <br/>if you want. A 
      movie maybe. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Really? I thought you weren't <br/>feeling so good. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Nothing a little Dawny time won't <br/>fix. If you feel like 
      bagging the <br/>peanut butter, I'll even buy you <br/>dinner.</p></p></center>
<p>Dawn happily ditches her quesadilla. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Thank God. Remind me to never invent<br/>that again 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Great. This'll be great. I'll just <br/>grab the paper, see 
      what's playing. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I'll leave a note for Buffy on the <br/>refrigerator. It's the 
      first place <br/>she goes when she gets home from <br/>patrolling. She's 
      such a pig after <br/>she kills things.</p></p></center>
<p>They move off, full of their evening plans. 
      <p>
<div align="right">FADE TO:</div>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT 
      <p>It's later. Buffy comes home to an empty house. A single light burns in 
      the foyer. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hello?</center>
<p>Nothing. Buffy starts toward the kitchen, but stops when she hears 
      something BUMP upstairs. Senses alerted, Buffy moves cautiously up the 
      stairs. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy moves quietly down the dark hall. There is more noise coming from 
      Willow's room. Bumping, scraping... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Willow? Dawn?</center>
<p>There's no answer. Just sudden quiet. Buffy enters Willow's room. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - WILLOW'S ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy walks into the room, which is lit by a lone lamp. On the floor 
      she finds Willow's MAGIC TRUNK, where she keeps all her spells, potions 
      and herbs... The trunk is open, and the contents are spilled - as if 
      someone has just rifled through it. 
      <p>Buffy catches sight of something moving out of the corner of the room, 
      making for the door. Buffy swings around and SLAMS the intruder into the 
      wall. Is surprised to find that it's AMY, looking strung-out and pale. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What are you doing here-</center>
<p>Amy laughs nervously. She's clearly wasted, out of it 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Uh oh. Busted. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Where's Willow? 
      <p>AMY<br/>She said... She said I could-</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy sees a bag of green herb in Amy's hand. Snatches it away. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What is this?</center>
<p>Amy tries to snatch it back, defensive. But Buffy keeps it. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>It's not what you think it is. It's<br/>sage. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That <u>is</u> what I think it is.<br/>(then)<br/>What's going 
      on? Where's Willow and <br/>Dawn? 
      <p>AMY<br/>(trying to remember)<br/>Willow. I saw her, but that 
      was<br/>before-<br/>(distracted/sincere)<br/>I like your top. When does the 
      <br/>Slayer find time to shop? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So they didn't let you in. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Not that they know of. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What else did you take? 
      <p>AMY<br/>Nothing-</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy SLAMS Amy against the wall again. 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>Ow! That- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What else?</p></center>
<p>Buffy reaches into Amy's pockets, starts pulling out all manner of 
      spell materials. Amy grows desperate, pathetic- 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Please, please... I need this stuff. <br/>Willow wants me to 
      have it. She <br/>understands- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Understands what? Breaking into <br/>people's houses for 
      kitchen spices? <br/>I don't think so. 
      <p>AMY<br/>You should. She's as bad as me. <br/>Worse. I bet she's at Rack's 
      right <br/>now.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy shoots Amy a chilling look. Talk. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Rack's. 
      <p>AMY<br/>A place. He does spells. Heavy<br/>stuff.<br/>(a tad bitter) 
      <br/>Willow's his new favorite. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>She's there? With Dawn?</p></p></center>
<p>Amy laughs nervously again. She's starting to look kind of green. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Don't shake me again, super strength.<br/>I think I'm going 
      to boot. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Tell me where this place is and I<br/>won't. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Downtown. But it moves. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What do you mean "it moves?" 
      <p>AMY<br/>It's downtown... I don't know where it <br/>would be tonight, 
      exactly. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So how do I find it? 
      <p>AMY<br/>You kinda have to feel it out... Oh,<br/>God. I really am gonna 
      be...</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Amy starts to look like she's going to be ill. 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>I'm gonna...</center>
<p>Buffy tosses Amy aside, toward the bathroom. Then she takes off. 
      <p>EXT. SUNNYDALE STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow leads Dawn down a dark Sunnydale street. Warehouses, that kind 
      of thing. In the time that has passed since we last saw them, Willow has 
      grown jittery, anxious. She looks a little pale and clammy... But she's 
      doing her best to conceal it from Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>So the burger was okay? You liked it? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Are you kidding? It was like a meat <br/>party in my 
      mouth-<br/>(stops herself)<br/>Okay. I'm just a kid and I know that <br/>came 
      out wrong.<br/>(then)<br/>It was good. You should have had <br/>something. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I will. I'll eat. I'm saving myself<br/>for popcorn.</p></p></center>
<p>Willow awkwardly changes the subject to something she's been wanting to 
      ask all night. She knows it's loaded. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>And what about the other day, did you <br/>have 
      fun? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Which other day? Give me a Mon or a <br/>Fri, here. Something to 
      work with. 
      <p>WILLOW <br/>The day with Tara.</p></p></center>
<p>Dawn sees another opportunity to play peace-maker here. Takes it. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Oh. Yeah. I mean, it was nice - but it<br/>wasn't a laugh 
      riot. She's sad and <br/>everything. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>She is? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Sure she is. You both are, aren't<br/>you?</p></p></center>
<p>Willow takes this in. Feels the grief for a moment. Pushes it away. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Of course. You can't be close to <br/>someone like that 
      and not be... But<br/>it was all for the best, I think. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Right. Sure.<br/>(then)<br/>But I still keep thinking of you guys 
      <br/>back together, you know? I mean, I <br/>know she misses you. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>She does? Did she say something? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Not exactly. I could just tell, by <br/>the way she was acting. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(disappointed)<br/>Oh.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow shudders. A wave of withdrawl-related discomfort coming over 
      her. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Are you sure you're okay? You look<br/>a little... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No. I'm fine.<br/>(avoiding)<br/>And Tara's in her new place? 
      Settled<br/>and everything? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>We didn't really get into it-</p></p></center>
<p>Dawn looks around. Realizes she's on unfamiliar turf. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Is this right? Is this the way to the<br/>movies? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah... I kind of took you the long <br/>way around, but we're 
      almost there...</p></center>
<p>Now we see that they are stopped in front of ANOTHER DIRTY ALLEYWAY. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I just have to make one quick stop 
      <br/>first.</center>
<p>OFF WILLOW 
      <p>Guilty, jonesing.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. DEALER'S PLACE - OUTER ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow and Dawn emerge through another portal into Rack's outer room, 
      which again has a few strung-out folks in it. Dawn looks more than a 
      little freaked out. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>What is this place? Why is it hidden?</center>
<p>But Willow tries to play it off. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I don't know. But it's cool, 
      isn't<br/>it?<br/>(quickly)<br/>Now, you just hang here for a minute <br/>and 
      I'll be right back. You want me <br/>to conjure you a magazine or 
      <br/>something? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What about the movie? It starts at<br/>nine.</p></center>
<p>Dawn glances at a clock on the wall. It's quarter to nine 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>We'll make it. I mean, it doesn't <br/>matter if we miss 
      the trailers.</center>
<p>With that, Willow slips into Rack's inner sanctum, to the meek protests 
      of the other people waiting for Rack. 
      <p>OFF DAWN 
      <p>Scared. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>I like the trailers.</center>
<p>INT. DEALER'S PLACE - OUTER ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>It's later. An anxious Dawn still sits in the waiting room. A CREEPY 
      GUY slides into the seat next to her. A beat. Then Dawn moves away. She 
      looks at the clock. 
      <p>ON THE CLOCK 
      <p>It reads 10:00. 
      <p>ON DAWN 
      <p>Sweating it. She's been waiting an hour. 
      <p>INT. DEALER'S PLACE - INNER ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>ON RACK 
      <p>Who hangs out on a sofa, light playing across his face as he enjoys the 
      spell he's cast. 
      <p>
<center>RACK<br/>What do you think, Strawberry? Can<br/>you handle some 
      more?</center>
<p>Rack raises his hand and THE LIGHT IN THE ROOM INCREASES. 
      <p>ON WILLOW 
      <p>Who HANGS, suspended, mid-air, in the middle of criss-crossing BURSTS 
      of mystical energy. It's almost like a cage made out of small bolts of 
      lightning. 
      <p>CLOSE ON WILLOW 
      <p>Eyes closed, mouth agape. 
      <p>WHAT WILLOW SEES 
      <p>Her POV as she floats through SPACE. An inky, star-filled landscape... 
      It's very quiet and peaceful. (maybe we see her hands and feet float into 
      frame... she's in zero gravity...) Then, violently, something tears 
      through the tranquil image, like a claw ripping through a movie screen. 
      HARSH RED LIGHT POURS THROUGH THE RIP in the black sky. Now a shadowy 
      image moves through the light, holding a limp female body. It's all in 
      silhouette... 
      <p>ON WILLOW 
      <p>Still floating with her eyes closed, but disturbed now, scared... 
      <p>WHAT WILLOW SEES 
      <p>Now we can make out the figure that came through the rip. It's the 
      monster we saw before. The limp female body he holds is less distinct, but 
      it looks something like Willow... 
      <p>ON RACK 
      <p>As we hear Willow's scream. He smiles. 
      <p>INT. SPIKE'S LAIR - LOWER CRYPT - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike sleeps in his bed, naked under a single sheet. He gets hit in the 
      chest by a heavy candle. He starts, sits up, ready to fight. 
      <p>He stops when he sees Buffy standing some distance away, ready to pitch 
      another candle at him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>God. Do you sleep through anything? <br/>I was, like, 
      yelling, and nothing-</center>
<p>Spike swings his legs over the bed, still partly covered by the sheet. 
      He's a little groggy. Pleased to see her, if a bit confused... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>(pointed)<br/>I'm a bit knackered. Had a 
      long<br/>night.<br/>(touches his chest)<br/>Someone should teach you how to 
      use<br/>candles in foreplay, luv-</center>
<p>Buffy throws him his pants. Ignores the comment. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Get dressed. Dawn's missing.</center>
<p>Spike's expression hardens. She's being a bitch to him. Again. And Dawn 
      is missing... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Again? You ever think of a Lojack<br/>for the 
      girl?<br/>(then)<br/>What's the story? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>She went out with Willow- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Willow...<br/>(smiles)<br/>Kind of a sorry excuse to come 
      <br/>'round. You want the touch, all you <br/>need to do is- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spike. Willow's into something. She <br/>and Dawn have been 
      missing for hours. <br/>There's some guy called Rack-</p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike grows concerned at this. Suddenly he's all business. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Rack? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He's some kind of- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I know who he is. He deals in magic.<br/>Black stuff. 
      Dangerous. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I've been all over downtown and I<br/>can't find his place- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Because he cloaks it. You can't feel<br/>it unless you're into 
      the big bad.<br/>A witch or a vampire or- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So let's go.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike stands, again unconcerned about his nakedness. Buffy turns her 
      back so she can't see. Spike looks at her, incredulous. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>That's right. Hide your blushing<br/>eyes.</center>
<p>INT. DEALER'S PLACE - OUTER ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn, still waiting for Willow, looks at the clock. 
      <p>ON THE CLOCK 
      <p>It's almost eleven now. 
      <p>ON DAWN 
      <p>She makes a decision. Gets up and moves toward the door of Rack's room. 
      THE CREEPY GUY protests- 
      <p>
<center>CREEPY GUY<br/>Hey! Wait your turn.</center>
<p>Dawn ignores him, reaches for the door, when WILLOW opens it suddenly 
      and steps into the room. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Hey, Dawny! Come on, it's movie time- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(pissed)<br/>Do you know how long I've been out <br/>here? It's 
      too late for the movie-<br/>(hushed/re: creepy<br/>guy)<br/>-and that guy 
      smells like <u>foot</u>-</p></center>
<p>Dawn stops, alarmed. WILLOW'S EYES ARE COMPLETELY BLACK. She's 
      tripping. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Are you - are you okay? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm fine. Let's get out of here.</p></center>
<p>Willow heads for the door. Dawn follows. 
      <p>EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow leads a seriously spooked Dawn down the dark street. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>So what do you want to do, cutey? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's late. I just want to go home. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No way. I said we were going to have <br/>fun. We are going to 
      have fun.</p></p></center>
<p>ANOTHER ANGLE 
      <p>Something moves in the shadows behind them. Raspy, choking breathing in 
      the dark. It's following them. 
      <p>BACK ON WILLOW AND DAWN 
      <p>Dawn senses something. But Willow's oblivious. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>I'm serious. I think we should get<br/>out of here. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(mocking)<br/>"I think we should get out of here." 
      <br/>(then)<br/>It's grown up time, Dawny. You want <br/>to play with the 
      grown ups or not?</p></center>
<p>Dawn's now officially terrified. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Why are you acting this way? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh, God. Don't get all weird. We're<br/>fine. Everything's 
      fine.</p></center>
<p>Willow moves off down the street. Dawn has no choice but to follow. 
      <p>ANOTHER ANGLE 
      <p>More shmuck bait. Then we see what's following them. It's THE MONSTER 
      FROM WILLOW'S HALLUCINATIONS. Only now it's no fantasy. It's real and it's 
      stalking them. 
      <p>EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike and Buffy move down another dark street. Spike's peering in dark 
      corners and alleys, concentrating. Buffy watches him anxiously. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Anything? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Not yet. Maybe I'd pick up on it if <br/>you stopped asking 
      every two seconds. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I swear to God, Spike, if you're<br/>dragging this 
out-</p></p></center>
<p>Spike stops. Pissed. Hurt. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>What? So I can linger near your <br/>precious self? Get a 
      grip- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Like you've never drawn things out <br/>before- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Maybe. But we've been over this, <br/>haven't we? Things have 
      changed. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Will you <u>quit</u> with that!<br/>(hard)<br/>The only thing 
      different is that I'm <br/>disgusted with myself. That's the <br/>power of 
      your charms. The other <br/>night was the most perverse, <br/>degrading 
      experience of my life-</p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike can't help himself. He remembers. Smiles. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Yeah. Me too. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well maybe you get off on it, but <br/>it's not my style- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(dead serious) <br/>No, it's your <u>calling</u>. Gave me a 
      run<br/>for my money, Slayer.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks shaken by this. Spike continues, sincere. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Now, I admit, you've had me by the <br/>short 
      hairs. I love you. You know it.<br/>(then)<br/>But I got my rocks back. You 
      felt<br/>something last night- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Not love-<br/>
<p>SPIKE<br/>(stung)<br/>Not yet. But I'm in your system now. <br/>You're 
      going to crave me like I crave <br/>blood. And the next time you come 
      <br/>calling, if you don't stop being such <br/>a bitch, maybe I will bite 
      you.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy's deeply upset. He's gotten to her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I want you out of my life, Spike. <br/>Out of my work, my 
      house- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Too late for that. You already <br/>invited me in. And as for 
      work... <br/>you need me. Like tonight- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Forget it. I'll find Dawn myself- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You really going to put your little sis in <br/>danger, just to 
      spite me?</p></p></p></center>
<p>This stops Buffy. Of course she isn't 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Didn't think so. Now come on.</center>
<p>He starts down the alley. A long beat. Then Buffy moves after him. 
      <p>EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow and Dawn move down the alley, deeper into the bad part of town. 
      Dawn's freaking. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Willow, I'm serious, I'm going home. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>So go. God, I thought we were going<br/>to hang- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You're not coming with me?</p></p></center>
<p>Willow stops. Realizes she can't do that. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I don't know. Maybe I could just... <br/>pop you back? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(appalled)<br/>With magic?</p></center>
<p>There is a NOISE. Something moving in the shadows. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>What's that? 
      <p>WILLOW <br/>What? I didn't-</p></center>
<p>Another noise. Dawn turns and starts off at a fast clip. Almost a run. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Ilm getting out of here.</center>
<p>Willow follows, smiling, not taking it seriously. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Dawny. Don't. It's a cat or a-</center>
<p>SCARY FUCKING MONSTER 
      <p>That they practically run right into. Willow immediately recognizes him 
      from her hallucinations. Blanches. She grabs Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>It's okay. It isn't real-</center>
<p>The monster, we'll call him MANDRAZ, advances. Comes forward with his 
      raspy breathing and hot, putrid breath... 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(terrified)<br/>Seems real. Very, very-</center>
<p>Now Mandraz speaks, and his voice is eerie, otherworldly. 
      <p>
<center>MANDRAZ<br/>(to Willow)<br/>You summon me, witch? 
      <p>WILLOW <br/>What? I didn't- 
      <p>MANDRAZ<br/>Did. You raised hell with your <br/>majiks...</p></p></center>
<p>He lifts a hand with razor sharp claws to DAWN. Draws it across her 
      cheek, raising a thin line of blood. Savors the word- 
      <p>
<center>MANDRAZ (cont'd)<br/>Freshhhhhh...</center>
<p>Willow tries to get in front of Dawn 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Don't. Don't hurt her. She has<br/>nothing to do with 
      this. It was me-</center>
<p>Mandraz grins. Black teeth. Blood stained. 
      <p>
<center>MANDRAZ<br/>Yes. But I pick who dies.</center>
<p>Mandraz moves closer yet to Dawn. But DAWN LASHES OUT, KICKING MANDRAZ 
      BACK and taking off in a run. Willow sprints after her. They race down the 
      alley, with the monster on their heels 
      <p>EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ALLEY - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow and Dawn round a corner, just one step ahead of MANDRAZ. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>He's coming! He's too fast!</center>
<p>Willow spies something and grabs Dawn, yanking her toward A PARKED CAR. 
      She shouts- 
      <p>

<p>The car comes to life and PEELS away from the curb, knocking Mandraz 
      back into the street. Hard. Willow sees this. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Yes!</center>
<p>She turns to Dawn, triumphant. But Dawn is wide-eyed, paralyzed. THE 
      CAR IS DRIVING ITSELF. The wheel spins magically as it careens around 
      corners, etc. 
      <p>ON MANDRAZ

      <p>As the car speeds faster and faster, staying ahead of the monster. Dawn 
      is petrified, but Willow can't help it - being high like she is - she's 
      getting off on the rush of it. She WHOOPS with excitement as the car takes 
      another corner.

      <p>At the crash site. The front end of the car is crumpled against the 
      tree, steam billowing from the radiator. It's chillingly quiet as we MOVE 
      ACROSS THE CAR to the front seat area... 
      <p>WILLOW is slumped against the wheel, uninjured but passed out. Dawn, 
      dazed, stirs. She has blood coming from some place on her head. And when 
      she moves she cries out, holds her arm- 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Oh! God...</center>
<p>It's sprained or broken. Either way it hurts like hell. She moves 
      painfully out of the car, in shock, finding her feet... And finding 
      herself face to face with MANDRAZ. Dawn SCREAMS and backs away. Mandraz 
      advances, swipes at her. Thinking fast, Dawn DROPS and ROLLS UNDER THE CAR 
      to escape him. Oil leaks from the car, on Dawn, nearly gets in her eyes... 
      Mandraz tries to grab her and pull her back - Dawn SCREAMS AGAIN. 
      <p>EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and Spike, still searching for them, hear Dawn's distant cry. 
      Start running. 
      <p>EXT./INT. CAR - STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Mandraz grabs at Dawn's leg. She shakes him off, but he grabs her again 
      and PULLS her out from under the car. He yanks her toward him, but Dawn 
      uses her good arm to HIT HIM IN THE FACE WITH A FIST-FULL OF DIRT AND OIL 
      - which temporarily blinds him. 
      <p>Mandraz yells with rage and THROWS DAWN INTO A CONCRETE PILLAR. She 
      hits the ground, hard. Mandraz advances. Dawn cowers, completely 
      terrorized. 
      <p>Then Buffy arrives at the scene, Spike just behind her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Dawn!</center>
<p>With that, Buffy runs FULL TILT toward the monster and TACKLES HIM WITH 
      ALL HER MIGHT. 
      <p>They go flying, slam into the ground. Buffy starts to wail on him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Did you ever pick the wrong girl.</center>
<p>Mandraz throws her off him, hard. He's strong. Spike moves to help Dawn 
      as the fight continues, with Buffy taking a few brutal hits. Still, she 
      makes slow headway. Then Mandraz tosses her and she lands hard. Buffy's 
      momentarily dazed. Mandraz advances. But just before he hits her again he 
      starts to SHAKE UNCONTROLLABLY AND WHIMPER. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Now you're scared? Better late than-</center>
<p>But now MYSTICAL ENERGY MOVES AROUND HIM. He SCREECHES horribly as his 
      SKIN STARTS TO SMOLDER. Then he BURNS UP, from the INSIDE OUT. A 
      nightmarish case of internal combustion. Fire licks from his black eye 
      sockets, the whole deal... When it's over, he's reduced to a black pile of 
      smoking ash. 
      <p>Now we see, behind where Mandraz was, WILLOW. Her eyes are black and 
      the same magical energy that killed Mandraz still crackles around her. She 
      clearly did it. The energy dissipates and Willow slumps to the ground, 
      exhausted. 
      <p>ON BUFFY 
      <p>Spooked by Willow's grim use of her power. Then she hears DAWN MOAN. It 
      brings her back to herself, and she rushes to Dawn and Spike. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Are you okay? What happened? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>He was after Willow. She made the<br/>car drive, and, 
      and-</p></center>
<p>Buffy notices Dawn holding her arm in pain. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Your arm. Let me see- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Don't! Don't touch it-</p></center>
<p>She's interrupted by WILLOW, stumbling toward them. Looking 
      disoriented, horrified. Aside from a few scratches, it's clear that she's 
      uninjured. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Oh God, Dawn, there's blood-</center>
<p>Buffy, coldly furious, can barely look at Willow. She and Spike gently 
      help Dawn up. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Okay. Come on, let's get you to a<br/>doctor- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(to Spike &amp; Buffy) <br/>Is she okay? Is she okay?</p></center>
<p>Spike and Buffy start to move with Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Back off, Will. We've got her-</center>
<p>Willow scrambles to step in front of Dawn, freaking. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>No, you're okay - right Dawn? I mean- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(hard)<br/>I mean it. Stay away ifrom her.</p></center>
<p>But Willow is locked onto Dawn. Desperate to get a connection. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Dawny, Dawny - I'm so sorry. It was<br/>an accident. I 
      just - I didn't see.<br/>I'm so, so sorry...</center>
<p>Dawn looks, makes eye contact with her. Finally. Then she SLAPS her 
      with her good arm. A stunned beat. Willow touches her face... 
      <p>Then Spike and Buffy, too angry and shocked to deal with Willow now, 
      start to help Dawn away. Willow starts after them, trips and falls. Starts 
      to cry. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>It was an accident. Don't... Oh 
      my<br/>God...</center>
<p>Buffy looks back. Torn. She and Spike meet eyes. He understands, moves 
      away with Dawn. 
      <p>Buffy moves back to Willow. Who holds the ground, her body shaking with 
      sobs. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd) <br/>I'm sorry... I'm sorry...</center>
<p>Buffy takes Willow's arm, moves to lift her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Get up. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I screwed it up. Everything. Tara...</p></center>
<p>Buffy roughly pulls Willow to a standing position, her anger finally 
      getting the better of her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, you screwed up! You could have <br/>killed her! You 
      almost did- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I know, I know- <br/>(then)<br/>I can't stop, Buffy. I tried, 
      and I<br/>can't. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You can. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I can't.<br/>(then)<br/>Please help me. Oh, God, I 
      need<br/>help...</p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow falls into her arms, holding on to her for dear life. Buffy 
      responds, moved by Willow's pain despite her anger. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Please, please...</center>
<p>OFF BUFFY AND WILLOW 
      <p>On the ground. The wrecked car in the distance. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - WILLOW'S ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>It's much later. Willow is wet from the shower and wrapped in a 
      blanket. She sits on tpe bed, looking more sober in every sense of the 
      word... Shaken to her core. 
      <p>Buffy comes in from the hall. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Is she okay? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Sleeping. The ER doc gave her <br/>something for the pain. It 
      knocked <br/>her out.</p></center>
<p>Willow takes this in. Trying not to fall apart all over again. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>But she's going to be alright? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's a fracture. It takes time,<br/>but... 
      <p>WILLOW <br/>God. I'm sorry... I'm so... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I just - I don't understand. Why <br/>you'd go to somebody like 
      Rack. And<br/>why you'd drag Dawn into it. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I didn't mean to. I wasn't going <br/>to... We were just going 
      to the <br/>movies. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So what happened? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't know.<br/>(then) <br/>The magic. I thought I had it 
      under <br/>control. And then... I didn't. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Why? Because of Tara? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No. It started before she left. <br/>It's why she left. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But everything seemed to be going so<br/>well... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It was... But, I mean, if you could <br/>be plain old Willow - 
      or Super<br/>Willow? Who would you want to be?<br/>(then)<br/>I guess you 
      don't actually have the <br/>option on the whole "super" thing. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Will, there's nothing wrong with you. <br/>You don't need magic 
      to be special- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Don't I?<br/>(near tears)<br/>Buffy, who was I? Just some girl. 
      <br/>Tara didn't even know that girl... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You were more than "some girl". And <br/>Tara <u>wants</u> you 
      to stop. She loves you- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>We don't know that- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I know that. I promise you. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It just, it took me away from myself. <br/>I felt so... 
      free.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy takes this in. Relating to every word she says, even though she 
      can't admit it. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I get that. More than you... But <br/>it's wrong. People 
      get hurt. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(chilled)<br/>If something had happened to Dawn <br/>tonight, 
      something worse... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I know. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(ashamed)<br/>I don't think you do. I was out of <br/>my mind. 
      I did things... I can't <br/>even...</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy does know. Completely. Willow continues, finding her resolve. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>But it's not going to happen again. <br/>I 
      promise. No more spells. I'm <br/>finished.</center>
<p>Buffy nods. Agreeing as much for herself, as for Willow. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Good. I think it's right. To give<br/>it up. No matter how 
      great it feels- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It's not worth it. Not if it messes with <br/>the people I 
      love.<br/>(then)<br/>I mean, it'll be hard. But I can do <br/>it. I know I 
      can. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hard - but not impossible. We'll be<br/>here for each other. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Totally. And magic wasn't all great.<br/>I mean, I won't miss 
      the nose bleeds <br/>and the headaches and stuff. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Right. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Or keeping stinky yak cheese in my <br/>bra.<br/>(off Buffy's 
      look) <br/>Don't ask. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, see, I don't have to now. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>'Cause it's over. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Exactly. It's over. From now on it's <br/>goodbye impulse - 
      hello impulse <br/>control.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They both smile a little shakily. Trying to have faith. 
      <p>
<div align="right">FADE TO:</div>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - WILLOW'S ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow lies in bed, wide awake, sweating and SHAKING. Going through 
      some magical version of the D.T.'s. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BUFFY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>CLOSE: ON WINDOW 
      <p>Where a bunch of fresh garlic is now nailed. 
      <p>WIDEN 
      <p>To find that there is garlic nailed up at all the windows. Buffy sits 
      up in bed, looking small and scared, holding a cross. 
      <p>
<div align="right">BLACK OUT.</div>
