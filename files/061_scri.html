<p>EXT. CEMETERY – NIGHT 
      <p>BAM! The heel of a boot spikes a VAMPIRE hard in the eye. He stumbles 
      back a few feet and BUFFY steps up, starts with the pummeling. She’s 
      dazzlingly efficient. 
      <p>ANGLE: in the grass 
      <p>Is the potential victim, turned away from us in a thick woolly coat, 
      hand to his neck. He turns to see what’s going on and we see it’s PARKER. 
      <p>
<center>PARKER<br/>Buffy? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Parker?</p></center>
<p>The vamps comes back at her – 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont’d)<br/>(to Parker)<br/>Stay down.</center>
<p>Buffy, fast on top of the vamp again, punching and kicking with amazing 
      style and strength. And when the vamp finally falls, Buffy pulls a stake. 
      THUNK – he’s DUST. Then… 
      <p>
<center>PARKER (O.S.)<br/>Buffy!</center>
<p>Parker has TWO HUGE VAMPS on him. Dragging him off. Seeing this, Buffy 
      flies over, taking both on at once. The Vamps drop Parker. And they engage 
      in a fast and intense slugfest. Buffy is even sharper than usual, if 
      that’s possible. And to finish them off, a spectacular flip-toss, STAKING 
      both vamps who SCREAM all their merry way to hell. 
      <p>Buffy stands alone, breathing only a little hard. Parker enters frame 
      tentatively. 
      <p>
<center>PARKER<br/>Buffy, I don’t know what to say.<br/>After how I’ve 
      treated you,<br/>and now I owe you my life. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It’s nothing. 
      <p>PARKER<br/>It’s everything. You’re everything.<br/>And I’m gonna do 
      whatever it takes<br/>to get you to forgive me. Do you<br/>think… one day, 
      you might?</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy might answer, but instead a DISTANT VOICE WHISPERS: 
      <p>
<center>GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)<br/>Sure, uh-huh…</center>
<p>And suddenly, Buffy is… 
      <p>INT. LECTURE HALL – DAY 
      <p>The room is dark except for the soft light reflected off a screen at 
      the front. PROF. MAGGIE WALSH’S VOICE echoes, mid-lecture. Buffy blinks, 
      jolted from her reverie. She looks at Willow beside her, then to the owner 
      of the girl’s voice. 
      <p>ANGLE: BUFFY’S POV 
      <p>Parker, whispering inaudibly to a pretty BRUNETTE, in the row in front 
      of her. 
      <p>And over this, Maggie’s lecture: 
      <p>
<center>PROF WALSH<br/>These are the things we want.</center>
<p>Riley clicks slides on one by one: A mother comforting her baby. A 
      kiss. A warm fireplace. A juicy hamburger. 
      <p>
<center>PROF WALSH<br/>Simple things. Comfort. Sex. Shelter.<br/>Food. We 
      always want them, and we<br/>want them all the time. The<br/>id doesn’t 
      learn. It doesn’t grow up.<br/>It has the ego telling it what it can’t have 
      – <br/>and it has the superego telling what it<br/>shouldn’t want. But the 
      id works solely by<br/>the pleasure principle. It wants. Whatever<br/>social 
      skills we learn, however much we<br/>have evolved, the pleasure principle 
      is<br/>at work in all of us.</center>
<p>Buffy begins to sink back into reverie. 
      <p>
<center>PROF WALSH (cont’d)<br/>So how does this conflict with<br/>the ego 
      manifest itself in the<br/>psyche? What do we do when we <br/>can’t have 
      what we want? I expect<br/>somebody here can answer that…</center>
<p>But not Buffy, who’s already doing it. 
      <p>EXT. CEMETERY – NIGHT 
      <p>We join the same fight in progress… the EXACT same fight, that ends the 
      exact same way, with Buffy alone in the frame looking noble, breathing a 
      little hard. And again, Parker enters the frame tentatively, only this 
      time he’s in a tanktop, has a large bouquet of roses and an open carton of 
      ice cream, spoon stabbed in it. 
      <p>
<center>PARKER<br/>Buffy, I don’t know what to say.<br/>After how I’ve 
      treated you,<br/>and now I owe you my life.</center>
<p>She looks down at him. He presents her with the ice cream. 
      <p>
<center>PARKER (cont’d)<br/>Can you ever forgive me?</center>
<p>With a placid nobility, she takes the ice cream. As her prefect hair 
      blows in a perfect breeze (there’s a perfect breeze now), she nobly eats a 
      spoonful, eyes on the horizon, and we:

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They start YELLING, frustrated.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">COLLEGE KID #2<br/>A Kidder's Gold Ale,

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">COLLEGE KID #1<br/>Do I need to write it 
      down for you?<br/>A glass of ice water, man. Simple 
request.</font></center>

      how do I make that?</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: THE ROOM<br/>Dark. Floor and walls 
      kinda grimy. But a pretty happening place for A WHOLE PILE OF COLLEGE 
      KIDS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We FIND Buffy at the door, entering then 
      stopping to scan the crowd. She sees…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Parker at a corner table, talking with the 
      same Brunette from Psych class. Before much can register someone stands in 
      her view. She moves to one side to see better, eyes on the spot Parker's 
      in - and she thuds soundly into Riley, causing him to spill a bit of his 
      (quite full) soda.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Whoah!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh! Sorry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You know, most people go 
      around. <br/>I'm not saying you CAN'T tunnel<br/>through me, I just think 
      the other way's quicker.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>In my defense, you take up a 
      lot of space.</font></center>

      looking for someone?</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">For she is still keeping an eye out to see 
      what Parker's up to.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Uh, no, I… saw Parker 
      there…</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Sets 'em up and knocks 'em 
      down.<br/>I guess maybe I'm old fashioned,<br/>but my father always says if 
      you<br/>want to be a gentleman… you don't<br/>care even the slightest bit 
      what my father says.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(good-natured)<br/>Forget about 
      it. I got people waiting.<br/>I'll see you in class.</font></center>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Uh huh…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy turns and takes a step toward Parker's 
      table, but stops dead in her tracks. Heart leaping into her 
      throat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Indeed Parker and the brunette are kissing 
      now… and kissing, passionately, deeply, on and on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy swallows hard. Turns to look away.

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">COLM<br/>No, I rudely interrupted. And

      <p>EXT. THE BRONZE – NIGHT 
      <p>Pre-recorded MUSIC POUNDS from inside. PARTIERS lined up to get in. 
      <p>INT. THE BRONZE – NIGHT 
      <p>Oz brings drinks to Willow at a table not far from the stage. The place 
      is fairly crowded. 
      <p>
<center>OZ<br/>You got a table. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I had to kill a man. 
      <p>OZ<br/>Well, it’s a really good table. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I copied out my notes for psyche,<br/>since you were so 
      elsewhere this<br/>morning. It’s pretty simple stuff –</p></p></p></center>
<p>The LIGHTS GO OUT and the pre-recorded MUSIC STOPS. The room HUSHES. 
      LIVE MUSIC begins to THROB. 
      <p>Willow regards Oz shifting in his seat, brow furrowed. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (CONT’D)<br/>(concerned)<br/>What’s the matter? 
      <p>OZ<br/>I...don’t know. Feel a little... it’s nothing.</p></center>
<p>A single LIGHT shines outward from the stage. Silhouetted in it, is the 
      hazy figure of a woman. In the light’s periphery, her band. Their MUSIC 
      PULSES with increasing intensity. The woman steps into a spotlight and 
      puts a hand on the mic. 
      <p>She is VERUCA. 20. With a charismatic energy and presence that’s fluid, 
      intense and highly sexual. 
      <p>Willow watches Oz. Oz watches the stage. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>We could go to your place. <br/>I could make 
      soup.</center>
<p>Veruca’s eyes take a moment to adjust to the bright light. Then turning 
      her head slowly and purposefully, her gaze falls directly on Oz. 
      <p>
<center>OZ<br/>No thanks. I’ll be fine.</center>
<p>And Veruca begins to SING. Oz stares at her. She seems to be singing 
      largely to him. 
      <p>Willow follows his gaze to the stage. She tenses – no way is this lost 
      on her. She subtly eyes Oz. His attention to Veruca is a surprise to her. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Do you know her? 
      <p>OZ<br/>Veruca? No, I’ve met the drummer,<br/>he’s cool. Never heard them 
      play...</p></center>
<p>Willow sits, suddenly wishing she didn’t have to hear them play. 
      <p>INT. COLLEGE PUB – NIGHT 
      <p>The table of intellectuals has loosened up quite a bit. 
      <p>
<center>GUYS<br/>(chanting)<br/>Chug! Chug! Chug!</center>
<p>ANGLE: IT’S BUFFY 
      <p>With the stein raised to her lips, going, going… A few empty pitchers 
      of beer litter the table, a couple of full ones yet to be had. Buffy 
      finishes her mug, BELCHES indiscreetly. Colm starts to refill her mug. 
      <p>
<center>COLM<br/>The thing the modern day pundits<br/>fail to realize is 
      that all of the<br/>socioeconomic and psychological problems<br/>inherent in 
      modern society can be<br/>solved by the judicious application of way<br/>too 
      much beer. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>My mother always says that beer<br/>is evil. 
      <p>COLM<br/>Evil, good, these are moral absolutes<br/>that predate the 
      fermentation of malt<br/>and fine hops. See…where was I? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I’m not really sure. 
      <p>KIP<br/>Well, Thomas Aquinas said – 
      <p>ROY<br/>No! There will be no Thomas Aquinas<br/>at this table! 
      <p>HUNT<br/>Keep your Theology of Providence<br/>to yourself, fatboy. 
      <p>KIP<br/>I was just drawing a parallel to – 
      <p>COLM<br/>Beer! Had the earliest morality been<br/>developed under the 
      influence of beer<br/>there would be no good and evil.<br/>There would be 
      “kinda nice”<br/>and “pretty cool”. Everything would be<br/>different. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(good-naturedly)<br/>You guys just love to hear 
      yourselves<br/>speak, don’t you? 
      <p>COLM<br/>We’re losing her, guys… 
      <p>ROY<br/>Say something interesting! 
      <p>HUNT<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Well, tell us about yourself. 
      <p>COLM<br/>Yeah. What do you like?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>A beat, as Buffy tries to come up with somethiing. Finally she hoists 
      her beer. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Well, I don’t hate this, for a start.</center>
<p>A general clamor of approval as Buffy drinks a hefty sip. 
      <p>ANGLE: XANDER 
      <p>At the bar, watching, worry increasing.

<p>INT. LECTURE HALL – DAY 
      <p>At the front of the room, Maggie Walsh addresses the students. Riley 
      stands by, watches as… 
      <p>Buffy wriggles in her seat. Short attention span. 
      <p>Beside her, Willow regards her jacket, thrown yet again on the empty 
      seat she has saved for Oz. 
      <p>
<center>PROF WALSH (O.S.)<br/>Now, next class, we’ll be moving<br/>on to 
      personality types and disorders.<br/>Those of you who’ve done the

<p>Buffy shoots her hand up. 
      <p>
<center>PROF WALSH<br/>Yes? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(re: Willow)<br/>She read the… reading.</p></center>
<p>The class erupts in a hushed giggle. It’s not entirely lost on Buffy. 
      Both she and Willow sink in their chairs, embarrassed. At the front, Riley 
      frowns. 
      <p>
<center>PROF WALSH<br/>Well then, she’ll have some time<br/>on her hands. As 
      I was saying…</center>
<p>As she continues talking, Buffy cranes her neck up. Her nose twitches. 
      Follows it until she spots a FEMALE STUDENT to her right, trying to hide 
      her coffee and cold turkey sandwich lunch under her desk. Chewing slowly 
      and discreetly. 
      <p>
<center>PROF WALSH (O.S.)<br/>…We don’t have time to cover it<br/>all in 
      class. But it doesn’t mean it’s<br/>not worth knowing…</center>
<p>Buffy licks her lips. Maggie continues talking and the sandwich gets 
      harder and harder to resist. 
      <p>
<center>PROF WALSH (cont’d, O.S.)<br/>And it doesn’t mean it won’t be 
      on<br/>the mid-term. Now, if I’ve been unclear<br/>in any way, speak

<p>And Buffy snatches it right from the girl’s mouth. Stuffs it into her 
      own. 
      <p>

<p>Willow pulls it back out. The girl regards Buffy like a retarded

<p>He looks around, then sees Xander walking back to the bar. His eyes 
      narrow, blaming him for his sudden lack of woman. 
      <p>INT. THE GROTTO – NIGHT 
      <p>The place is dark and definitely cave-like. Graffiti on the walls. 
      Grimy floor, torn leatherette couches, soda machine. SLEEPING STUDENTS 
      draped over a good portion of it all. 
      <p>Willow enters in a bad mood, books in hand, and sees 
      <p>PARKER 
      <p>reclining in a corner, reading, alone. 
      <p>She can’t contain herself any longer. She walks up, stands before him. 
      Silent, ‘til he slowly looks up from his book. 
      <p>
<center>PARKER<br/>Hey.</center>
<p>She just glares down at him. 
      <p>
<center>PARKER (cont’d)<br/>Uh, did you want something? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yes. I wanna give you a piece of<br/>my mind. ‘Cause I’ve had 
      it with you<br/>and your… man-ness. Buffy is really<br/>hurting right now. 
      In fact, she’s<br/>in need of a big mental tidy.<br/>Parker, how could you 
      do this to her?</p></center>
<p>Parker’s surprised and concerned. 
      <p>
<center>PARKER<br/>I don’t get what you mean. <br/>What did I “do”? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>She shared a very intimate thing with<br/>you. And you act 
      like it was nothing<br/>more than a bag of… some kind of<br/>snack food! 
      <p>PARKER<br/>Willow. I’m not sure I need to <br/>explain my actions here. 
      But if that’s what <br/>you want… 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yes, followed by an admission of<br/>undeniable guilt, but go 
      on.</p></p></p></center>
<p>She sits, posture erect, scowl fixed. 
      <p>
<center>PARKER<br/>(beat)<br/>Some relationships center on a 
      deep<br/>emotional tie or…a loyal friendship <br/>or 
      something.<br/>(beat)<br/>But <u>most</u> are just two people<br/>passing 
      through life, enriching or<br/>aggravating each other’s lives briefly. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Go on. 
      <p>PARKER<br/>Just for one night. Can’t two people<br/>who feel an 
      attraction come together <br/>and create something wonderful? And<br/>then, 
      go back to their lives the next<br/>day, better for it, but never 
      over-analyzing<br/>it or wanting it to be more than it was?</p></p></center>
<p>He looks into her eyes, wondering if she’ll answer. Willow swallows. He 
      makes it all seem so okay. 
      <p>
<center>PARKER (cont’d)<br/>I have. She should too.</center>
<p>Willow softens her tone. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>People like Buffy, and…and me…assume<br/>intimacy means 
      friendship, and respect.<br/>People shouldn’t have to ask first,<br/>“Are 
      you going to be eyeing other<br/>prospects tomorrow?” 
      <p>PARKER<br/>And people shouldn’t have to preface<br/>casual sex with, 
      “Just so you know,<br/>I’ll never grow any older with you.”<br/>Takes the

      what we did.<br/>(beat)<br/>But I am sorry Buffy’s hurting.<br/>And if I

<p>Cro-Mags still on the loose. At a road now. They spin, mouths gaping 
      open, in awe of the bright street lamps. Cro-Mag Hunt ventures out into 
      the road. ZOOM…ZOOM! A CAR speeds by so fast he can hardly follow it with 
      his eyes. Suddenly compelled to chase, he raises his stick. And runs after 
      another car. The others watch. YELLING and CHEERING him on. Until… 
      <p>SCREEEEEECH!!…SMACK!! 
      <p>Cro-Mag Hunt is hit by a student-type, compact CLUNKER and sent flying, 
      landing with a sick THUD on the blacktop. 
      <p>The others come toward him as he wimpers in pain, his leg broken.

      <p>Gets out of the car, stunned, yet panicky, and approaches the group. 
      <p>
<center>DRIVER<br/>I didn’t see him! Is he okay?</center>
<p>The Cro-Mags turn, growling. The Driver stops dead. These guys are not 
      exactly human-looking. 
      <p>In a blind rage, the Cro-Mags all turn and run for the Driver who bolts 
      the other way. And surprisingly, the Cro-Mags don’t give chase. Instead, 
      they turn their watch on the empty car. With their makeshift clubs, they 
      pound the hell out of it, shattering the windows, crumpling the roof, hood 
      and trunk. 
      <p>Cro-Mag Colm suddenly stops. Sniffs, looks.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander approaches.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You guys had enough fun for 
      one night?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yes please.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Tired.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>And was there a lesson in all 
      this?<br/>What have we learned about beer?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Foamy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Good. Just as long as we're 
      clear.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They rise, start heading off. Buffy trailing 
      her club along the ground.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Anyway, I think the boys 
      are<br/>contained for the time being.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: a minivan</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As our three pass it. Inside, each of the 
      remaining Cro-Mags Colm, Hunt and Kip. Not sitting on the seats, just 
      crouching, fiddling with the knobs, grappling with the concept of 
      "glass".</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>They'll figure out how to 
      work the<br/>door locks when the effect has worn<br/>off. And they'll just 
      think they had too<br/>much beer. Which is surely close 
      enough.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Whose van is 
      that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I dunno. Wasn't 
      locked.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER (O.S.)<br/>Buffy!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy spins, sees Parker approaching. Xander 
      and Willow let her take a few steps toward Parker, hang back discreetly. 
      Cautiously, sincerely, Parker begins…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Buffy. I… I don't know how to 
      say this. <br/>I'm sorry for how I treated you before.<br/>It was wrong of 
      me, and… I'm sorry.<br/>(beat)<br/>And, you were great tonight. 
      Really.<br/>(beat)<br/>I may not deserve this, but…<br/>Do you think, you 
      could… forgive me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy regards him. More emotion than 
      coherent thought on her face. He seems honest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">In a flash, she raises a club high over her 
      head and brings it down HARD over his. He falls to the ground, 
      unconscious.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander and Willow join her, looking casually 
      down at the unconscious form at their feet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat. They all look at each other, then 
      just casually take off, strolling out of frame.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BLACK OUT.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">END OF SHOW</font></center>
<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></td></tr></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
