<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S ROOM - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We open with a ripple of WHITE, filling the 
      screen. The ripple flows past us and settles - it's a bed sheet. BUFFY is 
      in her room (her old room, not the dorm) and she's making the bed, along 
      with somebody else.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Smell good, don't 
      they?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see holding the other end of the sheet: 
      FAITH. And the two women talk like they're old friends. They make the bed 
      slowly, in sync, like they're performing a ritual.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Clean sheets. Like 
      summer.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>I wouldn't 
      know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now they ritualistically fold in the 
      corners…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Right. I 
      forgot.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>I noticed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks at A CLOCK on the wall. Her face 
      falls.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I wish I could stay, 
      but-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>You have to 
go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's just, 
      with…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Little sis coming. I 
      know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The bed is made. Couldn't be 
      neater.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>So much to do before she gets 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(glancing at clock)<br/>Now I 
      really have to go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>So go. Don't let me 
      keep-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith stops - looks at the bed, 
      disappointed.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Damn. Just when we made it so 
      nice.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Close-up of the bedsheet. Plop! A single red 
      drop of BLOOD hits the fabric, staining it. Then another drop of blood. 
      Then another, and another. The drops start to flow…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON FAITH. Now looking down at herself, 
      maintaining her casual tone. Buffy is holding a KNIFE in Faith's stomach. 
      Faith's bleeding on the sheets. The stain spreads…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>(sighs)<br/>Are you ever gonna 
      take this thing out?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As if in answer, Buffy's expression goes 
      hard and cold-blooded as she (out of frame) RIPS the knife up, hard, 
      killing Faith. Faith's expression turns to total shock, she opens her 
      mouth to scream but before we hear a sound we-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEEP! A hospital machine, monitoring a heart 
      beat. The iridescent green line skips just a little bit higher, just once, 
      then settles down into a steady, regular beat. Continues.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We pan across the room to the sound of the 
      machine and the sound of slow, regular breathing. Rest on the sight of 
      FAITH, lying alone, hooked up on the machine in a small, lonely hospital 
      room. It's not a nightmare, but it ain't too nice. A little paint peels 
      from one of the walls, and the overhead fluorescent light clicks on and 
      off, flickering.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith breathes steadily, lying still in her 
      coma. We hold on her face and go to…</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. XANDER'S BASEMENT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Close-up of a standard issue Initiative 
      BLASTER RIFLE. It's side panel's open, exposing a vastly complicated inner 
      design of criss-crossing wires, tubes and buttons.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER (O.S.)<br/>So, here it is. The 
      latest in state-of-the-art <br/>combat technology. I gotta say, 
      it<br/>doesn't look that complicated.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks on as Xander and Willow examine 
      the blaster by workbench lamplight. Xander's holding a wrench like he's 
      about to dig in. Giles watches from a chair.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>So, you can repair 
      it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Sure. Just as soon as I get 
      my master's <br/>degree in advanced starship technology.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He throws down his wrench in disgust. 
      Buffy's disappointed.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well, why don't we 
      experiment, then? You <br/>know, press some buttons, see what 
      happens.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I'd like to veto 
      that.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(nods)<br/>Second. It's called 
      a "Blaster," Will. The word <br/>that tends to discourage experimentation. 
      Now<br/>if it was called "The Orgasminator," I'd be first to <br/>try your 
      basic button-press approach.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(a little testy)<br/>Just tell 
      me - can you fix it or not?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Working on it, working on 
      it…<br/>(mutters)<br/>But if I blow a hole into Mom's azalea patch, <br/>the 
      neighbors will not be pleased.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander switches to needle-nose pliers, goes 
      back to fiddling with the blaster. Giles approaches Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Buffy, are you sure you're all 
      right? You've been <br/>patrolling around the clock three days<br/>straight, 
      perhaps you need…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What? Some rest? I can't, 
      Giles. There's a <br/>demonoid killing machine out loose, and it doesn't 
      <br/>only work the night shift.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I was going to say you might 
      need back-up, but <br/>now that you mention it, gathering strength is a 
      <br/>good idea.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Just get the blaster working. 
      That's all the strength <br/>I need.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Are you sure?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Why, because ray guns aren't 
      in the Slayer Handbook? <br/>You haven't seen this Adam thing, Will. 
      He's<br/>the Terminator without the bashful charm. He's fast, <br/>he's 
      deadly, and the last time we met - he kicked my ass.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh. No, blast away, by all 
      means, I only meant…<br/>(small)<br/>No word about Riley?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy freezes. Closes her eyes. Just hearing 
      his name causes pain.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>They keep telling me he's 
      fine, and that's all <br/>they'll say.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Maybe they're telling the 
      truth.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Maybe, but I don't even know 
      what <br/>The Initiative version of "fine" is. They <br/>could be forcing 
      him back onto medication, <br/>or torturing him for all I 
      know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I know it's hard, but from all 
      we've seen, <br/>I doubt they'd be trying to hurt him.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>The only thing I know for 
      certain is, <br/>my boyfriend's locked away and <br/>I'm not 
      helping.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Suddenly, in the background - BZZT! - 
      Xander, holding his pliers to the Blaster, gets loudly and painfully 
      zapped. Electric blue sparks burst up his arms, making him 
jump.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>YOW!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He regains his composure as best he can, 
      gets back to work. The others continue their conversation, never 
      noticing.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Maybe Giles has a point. 
      Riley is kind of <br/>their top gun guy. It doesn't make sense <br/>that 
      they'd hurt him.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But the Initiative has a whole 
      branch of <br/>brain-washy, behavior modification guys.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>So?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>So… what happens when 
      they<br/>start not liking Riley's behavior?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Nobody thought of that before. And as they 
      ponder the nasty possibilities, we CUT TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INITIATIVE - HOSPITAL ROOM - 
      DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley's getting out of bed. The one he was 
      last seen de-toxing in in Episode 14. On his bed stand lies Buffy's scarf. 
      Riley slowly, painfully pulls a shirt on over his bandaged ribcage. His 
      right hand is now bandaged in sterile gauze.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He stands. Tests his footing. Okay. He picks 
      up the scarf and walks out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INITIATIVE - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley walks past the GUARD who's standing at 
      his hospital room doorway. The guard, confused to see him up, stands in 
      his way.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Stand down, 
      soldier.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Guard doesn't move.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Stand down before I put you 
      down.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST appears by the Guard's side. Puts a 
      friendly hand on the Guard's shoulder.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>You heard the man. At 
      ease.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Guard steps aside. Forrest walks 
      alongside Riley, who moves slowly but deliberately. Baby steps.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>The shish-kebob that walks 
      like a man. <br/>Looks like you're doing better -- walking <br/>around and 
      threatening people and all that.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Man was in my way. I got 
      places to be.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Really? Where were you 
      thinking of going?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You know where I'm 
      going.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest stops, closes his eyes and sighs. 
      Riley just keeps taking those baby steps, holding the wall for support, 
      hard purpose in his eyes.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Don't even tell me you're 
      headed<br/>for that girlfriend of yours. Look at <br/>you! One good conjugal 
      visit and <br/>you'll be back in intensive care to stay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You wouldn't 
      understand.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest catches up to Riley. Not joking 
      anymore.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>How about you explain it to 
      me, then?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM joins the two of them. Immediately 
      sees the tension.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>We all friends here, 
      fellas?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Absolutely. Riley here's 
      just about to <br/>explain why he's leaving us so very 
      quickly.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I don't explain, because I 
      don't have to. <br/>I'm the one in charge.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>(ice cold)<br/>Things 
      change.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(same temperament)<br/>Do 
      they?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Hey. In case you failed to 
      notice, we <br/>are in a world of hurt around here, and <br/>now is the time 
      for us to band together, <br/>not go flying off our separate 
      ways.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Forrest has a point, 
      Rye.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>We have a problem, we will 
      deal with <br/>that problem, and you know the most <br/>important thing of 
      the equation right <br/>now is - we keep said problem within <br/>the 
      family.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Family. Is that what we 
      are?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest and Riley just glare at each 
      other.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Step aside.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest doesn't. Riley takes one step 
      forward, then grimaces in pain. Grabs his own side. Immobilized by the 
      pain.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Close-up on Faith's face. Still in her 
      hospital bed, motionless. Except - her eyelids twitch. A dream is coming. 
      And we hear:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH (O.S.)<br/>You think it's gonna 
      rain?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. FIELD - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now we are looking up at the most perfect 
      BLUE SKY you ever saw. Tilt down to reveal Faith and MAYOR WILKINS, 
      sitting on a blanket to a perfect picnic lunch. Alone together in a field 
      under the clear blue sky.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>Nonsense. There's not 
      a cloud in<br/>the sky. Now eat your sandwich.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They eat a little.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>I don't know, it just seems 
      like it <br/>always starts raining right about now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>You're too young and 
      too pretty <br/>a girl to start wearing worry lines <br/>on your face. 
      Oop…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He notices a small, harmless GARTER SNAKE 
      slithering across the blanket. Nothing to worry about. He picks it up and 
      sets it on its way, away from them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>There now, little 
      fella. I don't<br/>know where you belong, but it's<br/>sure not here with 
      us. There you go.<br/>(to Faith)<br/>You see? There's nothing that 
      can<br/>spoil our time together.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Mayor reaches into the picnic basket, 
      fishing about…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>Now who wants cheese 
      cake?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith smiles, a little re-assured. Then 
      suddenly:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>NO!!!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We cut back to the Mayor - he's being 
      horribly, brutally HACKED APART by Buffy with her knife. He's real dead 
      real fast. Finished with his prey, Buffy whips her gaze to Faith, 
      impatient and peeved.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/><b>I told you I had things to 
      do.</b></font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith tumbles back and crawls backward away 
      from Buffy as fast as she can. It's not nearly fast enough. Buffy is on 
      her in an instant. She lifts the bloody knife high out of frame - then 
      lashes it down to strike into Faith as the thundering sound of a rainstorm 
      blasts out and we CUT TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith, still in her coma bed, lies still but 
      twitches slightly. Her eyelids flicker as if in REM sleep. And instead of 
      settling down this time, they keep flickering, faster, like something's 
      building up inside her…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. WOODS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We are in the woods. A light swings into 
      frame. It's a flashlight, held by Buffy. Xander and Willow pull into frame 
      behind her, also carrying flashlights. On patrol.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Spread out?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(nods)<br/>Not too 
      far.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>So not a 
      problem.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow and Xander fan out, out of frame. We 
      hold on Buffy as she passes a cluster of brush, comes to a clearing, 
      coming around, looking up, to see…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's P.O.V.: before her in the tree is an 
      EVISCERATED DEMON. Looking like it's been crucified, but much worse. Its 
      arms splayed out on either side, its guts are missing. It is strung up 
      like Hannibal Lecter's cell guard in "Silence of the Lambs." It's head is 
      thrown back in a silent scream of demonic agony. Willow and Xander's 
      flashlights, coming from behind, send streams of light shooting through 
      its ribcage, blasting out its open mouth and eye sockets. If it weren't so 
      horrifying, it would be beautiful. Except, it's really 
      horrifying.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith is now RUNNING, dead-out panic. She 
      passes, near-stumbling, through a Sunnydale cemetery, pursued by some 
      monster we can't see. What we can see is Faith more scared than we've ever 
      seen her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She runs past a headstone, painfully bashing 
      her knee. Limps along, looks back to see:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith's P.O.V.: Buffy's walking calmly 
      toward her, knife in hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith runs some more. Trips and falls - into 
      an OPEN GRAVE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON THE GRAVE: Faith lands painfully 
      onto the packed dirt. Tries to get up and out, but Buffy walks over like 
      she's got all the time in the world, knife dangling in her hand. Buffy 
      drops into the grave with Faith. We hold outside the grave, hearing but 
      not seeing the fight within. Grunting, punching, and finally a wet noise - 
      followed by silence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Long pause. A drop of RAIN falls. Then 
      another. Then another.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A dirt-caked HAND thrusts itself up out of 
      the open grave, clutches soft grass and pulls itself up. It is FAITH, 
      Beaten, bloodied and torn, but alive. Victorious. The drops of rain 
      escalate into a torrential RAINSTORM as she pulls herself all the way out 
      of the open grave and stands. Looks to the night sky and lets out a YELL 
      of pain and triumph and agony all at once and we CUT TO:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see a close-up of Faith's face. 
      Motionless. Calm. Still. Only her eyes move, sliding over to look at the 
      machine she's so rudely plugged into. Slowly, as if testing her motor 
      skills, Faith lifts an arm into view and looks at it like it's some 
      foreign object. She flexes fingers. Everything works. So she slowly, still 
      testing, grabs hold of her white sheet and -</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RIPS it back off her. Nothing happens. The 
      sounds of the hospital P.A. system can be heard far off down the 
      hall.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith gets up from the bed. Stops short. 
      Realizes she's still hooked up by an I.V. tube stuck in her arm. She looks 
      at it - an annoyance - and pulls it out of her arm.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith wanders out into the hall. It's empty. 
      She's been stuck in some tucked-away basement wing of the hospital. She 
      walks a bit, then is stopped short when she hears:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VOICE<br/>Excuse me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith turns to face… not what she expected. 
      A pretty young hospital VISITOR. Girl about her age, nicely dressed and

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VISITOR<br/>Well… it was a tragedy, 
      really.<br/>Lots of students died. The<br/>Principal, the 
      Mayor…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith reacts, her face setting in grim stone 
      as the camera pushes in on her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VISITOR<br/>…it's a tragedy, really. 
      They<br/>never did find out for sure what<br/>started the fire. I really

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy sits in her dorm room, watching Riley. 
      Riley seems a little nervous, pacing (as best he can), picking things up, 
      putting them back again. Looking out the window. Not entirely 
      comfortable.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Me, neither. All I had in 
      there<br/>was this one little part of you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He pulls out Buffy's scarf, the one he had 
      wrapped around his hand, from his back pocket.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's just the scarf part of 
      me, really.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm serious. Knowing you were 
      out<br/>there, that you cared…<br/>(then, abruptly)<br/>You think we're being 
      watched?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Um… I don't know. Does 
      The<br/>Initiative do that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Maybe.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She gestures for him to sit next to her. He 
      tears himself away from the window, sits beside her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You seem a little… 
      somewhere<br/>else. Anything I can do?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Give me an order. That's what

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Don't have to.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Don't I? All my life, that's 
      what<br/>I've been groomed to do. They say<br/>jump, I ask how high, and I 
      get<br/>the job done. But I don't know if<br/>it's the right job 
      anymore.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know how you feel. It's 
      like,<br/>Giles is part of this council.<br/>For years all they did was give 
      me<br/>orders.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Ever obey

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Sure.<br/>(beat, then:)<br/>I 
      mean, the ones I was gonna do<br/>anyway. The point is, I quit 
      the<br/>Council. And it scared me, but<br/>now it's okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>See, we're different that way. 
      I<br/>just suck at the whole gray area<br/>thing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's a choice. You can go 
      back,<br/>maybe make some changes from the<br/>inside, or, quit the team and 
      keep<br/>fighting demons your own way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You make it sound so simple. 
      I<br/>don't even know what my way is.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Time to find 
      out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm a soldier. You take 
      that<br/>away, what's left?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>A good man.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Pause as Riley considers this. Buffy takes 
      his face gently in her hands and kisses his forehead. He closes his eyes, 
      enjoying it. She gently keeps kissing.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(smiling)<br/>What are you 
      doing?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Find any?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Not sure. Might have to keep 
      looking.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And in between kisses, she tells 
      him:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You have been strong long 
      enough,<br/>Riley Finn. And now I'm going to<br/>help you, and we will find

      the Orderly out of the room. The Older Nurse watches them go. And the

NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The wind blows as we pass across a field to 
      find Faith, standing alone, looking grim. We see what she sees:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith's P.O.V.: The RUINS of Sunnydale High. 
      (Matte).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith just stares at it, taking in the 
      sight, what it means, then suddenly turns and walks away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE MAIN STREET - 
NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As if in a dream, Faith walks down the 
      street. The people around her are alive and well. A happy COUPLE walks by, 
      arms around each other. Faith turns to watch them go and her eye is caught 
      by the sight of a YOUNG DAD and his beautiful dark-haired DAUGHTER, 
      walking down the sidewalk hand-in-hand. The little girl skips. Faith 
      watches like it's something she used to know and is trying to remember - 
      when her reverie is broken by a group of college-age PARTYERS. One bumps 
      into her, mumbles an apology, then they head off as a group. Faith watches 
      them go, thinking…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. GILES' COURTYARD - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see Faith slip into Giles' courtyard at 
      night. She crosses stealthily, without making a sound, to Giles' window. 
      She stands outside looking in, the shadows of tree branches playing on her 
      face. We see from her P.O.V.: Through the glass, the first thing she sees 
      is BUFFY.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith reacts. After all this time, there she 
      is.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Back to P.O.V.: Fuller view this time. 
      Riley, Buffy, Giles, Willow and Xander, inside, sitting around the living 
      room, talking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It looks cozy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We find Riley and Buffy in the middle of 
      their leading a war room session on Adam. Riley, seated, has the blaster 
      cradled in his lap.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>The puzzle, it seems to me, is 
      why<br/>Adam would stay dormant the past<br/>few days.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>When he's not making 
      performance<br/>art out of other demons, that is.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>He's probably working off 
      an<br/>autonomic power-source, and<br/>because he's straight out of 
      the<br/>box, needs to charge up awhile.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay - but what's he charging 
      up for?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Based on the clues? I'll go 
      with<br/>"killing spree."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>And that's a best-case 
      scenario.<br/>I suppose a little firepower<br/>wouldn't hurt right now. 
      Here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He opens a side panel on the blaster. 
      Presses a button. It makes a humming "power-up" noise (like the 
      power-packs in "Ghostbusters.") He hands it to Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>How'd you do that? How'd he 
      do that?<br/>(grabs Blaster)<br/>Is there like an "On/Off" 
      button<br/>somewhere in here?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. GILES' COURTYARD - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith, looking in, focuses on Buffy as she 
      gives Riley a small affectionate kiss on the head. Puts her arm around him 
      as he speaks. So natural she's not even aware she's doing it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But outside - Faith is. Very aware. She 
      focuses on Riley. Back inside…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The war room continues. Riley hands the 
      blaster to Xander.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Blasters are easy. Adam won't 
      be.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Since Professor Walsh 
      designed<br/>him - is there any chance she left<br/>instructions lying

      rings.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm just 
      saying…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Having a man on the inside 
      working<br/>for us could be…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>… A really great idea. You 
      sure<br/>you want to be double-agent guy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm not exactly sure what 
      you'd<br/>call me. But I will share<br/>information. Least I can 
      do.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Riley's right. It is the 
      least he<br/>can do.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles answers the phone.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Hello? Yes.<br/>(puzzled, to 
      Buffy)<br/>It's for you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy takes the phone.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hello? Speaking. What's 
      the<br/>emergency?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Her face drops.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'll let you 
      know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She hangs up.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>What is it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Faith. She's 
      awake.<br/>(stunned, then)<br/>Beat someone up, took her clothes<br/>and 
      disappeared out of the<br/>hospital. No one knows where she 
      is.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">One silent beat of shock, then everyone gets 
      talking fast.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I'd say this qualifies for a 
      worst-<br/>timing ever award.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What do we 
do?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>You must find 
      her immediately.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But what about 
      Adam?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Yeah - I'd hate to see the 
      pursuit<br/>of a homicidal lunatic get in the<br/>way of pursuing a 
      homicidal lunatic.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Faith's not exactly 
      low-profile-<br/>girl. I'll patrol, let her make<br/>a move…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>…And then 
what?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Ooh! I have an idea. Beat 
      the<br/>crap out of her!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Good plan.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Good on paper, but Giles has 
      a<br/>point. Let's say I talk to Faith…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow holds up a finger, 
waiting…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>After I beat the crap out of 
      her…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow nods and smiles.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>…we still have to make 
      a<br/>decision. Do I turn her over to<br/>the cops? They couldn't handle 
      a<br/>Slayer even if they knew we existed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What about the 
      Council?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Been there, tried that. 
      Not<br/>unlike smothering a forest fire<br/>with napalm, as I 
      recall.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>The Initiative? They do 
      have<br/>containment facilities.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>One word? Evil.<br/>(to 
      Riley)<br/>No offense.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>There's no way around it. 
      Faith<br/>is back, and like it or not, she's<br/>my 
      responsibility.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yeah, too 
      bad.<br/>(sighs)<br/>That was the funnest coma ever.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>First thing? We have no 
      idea<br/>where Faith is right now. What<br/>she's thinking, what she's 
      feeling…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>…Who she's 
      doing…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>She could be terrified. Maybe 
      she<br/>doesn't even remember. What if<br/>she does and she's sorry, 
      hiding<br/>alone somewhere?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">This shames Xander and the group into 
      shutting up a minute.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Perhaps there's some form 
      of<br/>rehabilitation we just haven't<br/>though of yet.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>And if not, ass-kicking makes 
      a<br/>solid plan B.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Don't think I'd rule it out. 
      But<br/>first we gotta find her. Then<br/>we'll take it from 
      there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat as they all consider the

      together.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What'd you tell 
      him?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>The truth. She's my 
      wacky<br/>identical cousin from England, and<br/>every time she visits,

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It's good you guys have such 
      an<br/>honest relationship.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I told him the story. Vagued 
      up<br/>some details, but no flat-out lying.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>That's fair. How'd you 
      handle<br/>the Angel-y parts?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Did some editing. Not that 
      I'm<br/>trying to hide anything from<br/>Riley, it's just - that's a

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Any luck?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Couldn't find her. Don't

      about before.<br/>She's moved on - to the first<br/>college beefstick she 
      meets. Not<br/>only has she forgotten the "love<br/>of her life," she's 
      forgotten all<br/>about the chick she nearly killed for 
      him…<br/>(then)<br/>So, that's my dream. Well, that<br/>and some stuff about 
      cigars and a<br/>tunnel. Tell me, College girl…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith saunters up to Buffy. Leans in, close 
      and menacing.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>…What does it 
      mean?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>To me? Mostly that you 
      still<br/>mouth off about things you don't<br/>understand.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith takes this in. Then - CRACK! She 
      punches Buffy in the head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy takes it - and comes back harder. 
      Faith goes down. She kicks Buffy's legs out from under her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy hits the ground. Faith moves toward 
      her and Willow hits her with a chair. Faith staggers, then knocks the 
      chair away. She's about to go for Willow when Buffy leaps up between 
      them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The two Slayers square off in their fight 
      stances. They hear the blaring "WHOOP!" of a POLICE CAR siren.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cops get out fast and head past the gathered 
      students, making their way straight to Buffy and Faith.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith sizes up the situation 
fast.</font></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith BOLTS - straight back toward the cops. 
      They make a grab for her but she plows through them like an NFL running 
      back breaking tacklers. She runs up and over the squad car, leaps off the 
      trunk, hits the ground running.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy runs around the car, hot after 
      Faith.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CAMPUS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith runs across the campus, past an 
      ultimate frisbee game, past a couple romantically "studying" under a tree. 
      Buffy follows. Faith gets to a wall on campus, scales it fast, and jumps 
      over the side. Buffy gets to the same wall, scales it, jumps 
      over…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: The other side of the wall. Buffy 
      lands to see that Faith is nowhere to be found. Just students, 
      milling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks in every direction, no Faith.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. COMMONS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow and Tara enter the commons, blending 
      in and looking around at the same time. Willow's checking the milling

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>It's okay. Really. So, um,

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Run. Flee. Maybe

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>You said "recon." You're 
      like,<br/>cool monster fighter.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well, technically, Faith's 
      not a<br/>monster, and as for fighting? I'd<br/>be lucky if I bruise her 
      fist with<br/>my face.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Oh.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Face punching… I'm not

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Don't worry - we're sure to

      five-by-five."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>"Five-by-five?" Five-by-five

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>That's the thing - no one

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara nods, believing it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>So… we "recon" 'til 
      nightfall?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(nods)<br/>Then the ritual 
      hiding begins.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow walks out of frame, still looking. 
      Tara follows.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles and Xander walk down the street 
      together. Giles checks the streets around him for any sign of Faith. 
      Xander's a little more caught up in his running monologue:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>…the point being, I could 
      be<br/>the target here. Faith finds Mr.<br/>Xander Harris still in town - 
      odds<br/>are she goes tighter than cat gut.<br/>Lot of pent-up feelings 
      there.<br/>I'm only saying.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(barely listening)<br/>Yes, I'm 
      sure.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I can't be held responsible 
      for<br/>the effect I have on women.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>No, of course 
      not.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>See, Faith and I have a 
      little<br/>thing between us called "history."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles stops short, holds up a hand to 
      silence Xander. They stand at an alleyway entrance - and there's noise 
      coming from inside. They enter the alley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. ALLEY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander and Giles enter the alley, backlit. 
      Xander pulls a hand-held taser from under his jacket - they step forward, 
      toward the noise - to find SPIKE. Emerging from the shadows, lighting a 
      cigarette.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Spike.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>What are you doing 
      here?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Me? Hey, I'm not the one out 
      of<br/>place here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>For your information, 
      smarty,<br/>we've got a rogue slayer on our<br/>hands. Real psycho-killer, 
      too.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Sounds 
serious.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>It is. What do you 
      know?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>What do you 
      need?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Her. Dark hair, this tall, 
      name<br/>of Faith, criminally insane…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Have you seen 
      her?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>This bird after 
      you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>In a bad way, 
      yeah.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Tell you what I'll do, then. 
      Head<br/>out, find this girl, tell her<br/>exactly where all of you are, 
      and<br/>then watch as she kills you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Off Giles's and Xander's dazed 
      expressions.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Can't anyone in your damned 
      little<br/>Scoobie Club at least try to<br/>remember that I HATE YOU 
      ALL?!?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Points to his head.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>And just because I can't do 
      the<br/>damage myself doesn't stop me from<br/>aiming a loose cannon your 
      way.<br/>(beat)<br/>And here I thought my evening'd be dull.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He shoves past Xander and Giles, heading out 
      the alley.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Go ahead - you wouldn't 
      even<br/>recognize her.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Dark hair, this tall, name 
      of<br/>Faith, criminally insane - I like<br/>this girl 
      already.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike storms out of the alley, smoking. 
      Xander turns to Giles.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>We're dumb.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We go from day to night. And in the night 
      sky, a single bright light appears. It pierces down and blinds us 
      momentarily. Rotors whirl to a loud roar. A helicopter is 
      coming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Looking up at the approaching light is the 
      Nurse from Faith's room. Her face is expressionless. She's a professional 
      and she's expecting this. She holds her cap pinched between two fingers to 
      keep it on against the approaching rotor wind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The helicopter lands. The Nurse approaches 
      it, ducking down like "M*A*S*H" doctors under the slowing 
      blades.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Three MEN get out. We don't know it yet, but 
      they are Watcher Council Special Ops (COLLINS, WEATHERBY AND SMITH). None 
      of them say a word. They are all dressed similarly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Whoever they are, you don't want them 
      around. They look deadly. Leather coats, black gloves and hats. Each one 
      carries a smart-looking leather briefcase. Each briefcase is 
      new.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They exchange some words, briefly (we can't 
      hear a thing they say) with the Nurse then march away from the tarmac as 
      the unmarked helicopter lifts back up into the sky.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE MAIN STREET - 
NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith leads up main street, looking nervous. 
      She pauses, stops before a sporting goods store. Inside the glass is a 
      KNIFE. Looks like just what she needs. She looks left, looks right, then 
      freezes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A PATROL CAR is sidling up the street, 
      slowly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith forces herself to be casual and steps 
      away from the window. She turns and walks down the street, blending in 
      with the pace of the pedestrians around her. Then she walks a little 
      faster.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The patrol car picks up just a little speed, 
      heading her way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith ducks into an ALLEY.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith presses herself against the wall of 
      the alley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The lights of the police car come, 
      illuminate her, then go. Faith breathes a sigh of relief. She doesn't move 
      for a moment. Then heads out the alley, but her path is now blocked - by 
      someone big.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's a DEMON. Huge, horns, the whole 
      bit.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEMON<br/>Faith.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith tries to get away, but it won't be 
      easy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEMON<br/>A friend sent 
      me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The demon approaches her, reaching around to 
      the small of his back. Faith looks around. No exit…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEMON<br/>I got a little remembrance 
      from…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith shoots a hand out fast as lightning, 
      grabs the Demon's neck and with a sickening twist, SNAPS it. The Demon 
      falls to the ground, dead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith starts to step over and past the Demon 
      when the police car slowly backs up for a second look. Faith starts to run 
      out the alley but stops. She looks down to the weapon in the Demon's hand. 
      It's not a weapon - it's an ENVELOPE. A thick, oversized manila one marked 
      "Office of the Mayor, Sunnydale CA." Faith picks it up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She jumps to the top of the back wall like 
      an alley cat. The searchlight swings by, illuminating her. It passes, then 
      swings back - but she is gone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. APPLIANCE STORE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see a broken door LOCK. Smashed off its 
      hinges, splintered wood around it. We go inside…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Inside an appliance store. Pass a store room 
      filled with stereo equipment, DVD players, video recorders, and various 
      electronics. We find Faith, sitting alone, her face illuminated by the 
      electric blue glow of a television set.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She's watching TV. Whatever it is, it's the 
      most interesting show she's ever watched. We hear the familiar voice of 
      MAYOR RICHARD WILKINS.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS (O.S.)<br/>Hello, Faith. 
      If you're watching<br/>this tape, it can only mean one 
      thing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Reverse angle to show the TV. Mayor Wilkins 
      is on the screen. We push in as he speaks, so he's on our screen as well. 
      He stands in his office, before the American flag.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>I'm dead. And our 
      noble campaign<br/>to bring order to the town of<br/>Sunnydale has failed, 
      utterly and<br/>completely.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He pauses, thinking, then 
      brightens:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>On the other hand - 
      heck, maybe we<br/>won! And right now I'm on some jumbo<br/>monitor in the 
      Richard Wilkins<br/>museum, surrounded by a bunch of<br/>kids sitting 
      "Indian style" and<br/>looking up at my face, filled with<br/>fear and 
      wonder. Hi, kids!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He waves happily, then straightens his tie. 
      Serious:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>But the realist in me 
      tends to <br/>doubt it. Now Faith. As I record<br/>this message, you're… 
      sleeping.<br/>And the doctors tell me you might<br/>never wake up. I don't 
      believe<br/>that. Sooner or later, you'll <br/>find the world has gone 
      and<br/>changed on you. I wish I could<br/>make the world a better place 
      for<br/>you to wake up in. But tough as<br/>it is to accept, we both have 
      to<br/>understand that even my power to<br/>protect and watch over you has 
      its<br/>limits.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Mayor looks saddened by this fact, then 
      continues:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>The hard pill to 
      swallow here is:<br/>once I'm gone, your days are just<br/>plain numbered. 
      Now, I know<br/>you're a smart and capable young<br/>woman in charge of her 
      own life<br/>but the problem, Faith, is that<br/>there won't be a place in 
      the<br/>world for you anymore. Right now,<br/>I bet you're feeling very 
      much<br/>alone. But you're never alone.<br/>You'll always have me. 
      And,<br/>you'll always have this.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Onscreen, he holds up a BOX.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>Go ahead, look in the 
      envelope.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith, dubious, looks in the 
      envelope.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>Don't worry, it won't 
      bite.<br/>(laughs)<br/>That's my job.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith reaches in, pulls out an ornately 
      carved wooden BOX. The same one the Mayor is holding onscreen.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>Open 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith opens the box, reaches in, and pulls 
      out… a DEVICE. A small but intricate-looking metallic mechanism with three 
      metal prongs that extend out and end in small, circular loops. Faith looks 
      at it curiously, holding it up to the light, turning it this way and 
      that.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAYOR WILKINS<br/>Surprise! You don't 
      get these in<br/>any gumball machine. See, when<br/>you've been around as 
      long as I<br/>have, you make friends, and some<br/>of them forge neat little 
      gizmos<br/>like the one you're holding now.<br/>And here's the good news: 
      Just<br/>because it's over for you, doesn't<br/>mean you can't go out with a 
      bang.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He laughs. She examines the 
      device.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We are in Riley's room with Buffy and Riley. 
      Buffy's locking the locks on the door. Turns to Riley.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Okay, I get it. Really. 
      "Faith<br/>bad." Do I look like I'm arguing?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Not yet, but you always make 
      that<br/>innocent face just before you start.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Figured that out, 
      huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy nods.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Damn, took Mom twelve years 
      to<br/>catch that one. All I'm saying<br/>is, if you're in trouble, I want 
      to help.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You can't.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Give me one reason 
      why.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">In answer, Buffy casually tosses Riley one 
      of the mini-Nerf basketballs lying around the room. He catches it, winces 
      in sharp pain.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Aah!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's one.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Okay, I'm not exactly action

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley, the fact that you 
      just<br/>called Faith a "gal" only proves<br/>you never met 
      her.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I've never seen anybody get 
      under<br/>your skin this way before. What<br/>did she do to you, 
      exactly?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's a long 
      story.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm from Iowa, we drive four 
      hours<br/>for a high school football game.<br/>Try me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He folds his arms and waits at the door. 
      Buffy can see he's not giving up without some spillage of the 
      beans.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I told you. She hurt me, and 
      some<br/>people I care about and did I<br/>mention the psycho-killer 
      part?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>There's something you're 
      not<br/>telling me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I have to go. She's out 
      there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>All right, I'm just saying, 
      I<br/>think you're holding out on me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She tries to get past him. He playfully 
      grabs her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy pulls back.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's not a joke, Riley. 
      There's<br/>a criminally insane woman out<br/>there with, oh, did I mention 
      -<br/><i>super powers</i> - who thinks I'm<br/>responsible for ruining her 
      life.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She comes to him, more tender.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know Faith. She'll come 
      after<br/>me, and she'll come after the<br/>people I love.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A doorbell rings. The door opens. It's JOYCE 
      SUMMERS answering the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Her smiling face goes from curious to 
      terrified.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. JOYCE'S ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith. Sitting at Joyce's vanity mirror, 
      rummaging through a drawer filled with cosmetics. She plucks out, examines 
      and rejects different shades of lipstick, one by one.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>"Ruby Sunset…"<br/>(tosses 
      it)<br/>"Burgundy Skyline…"<br/>(tosses it)<br/>"Harlot." Huh. Way to go, 
      Joyce.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see Joyce, sitting on the edge of her 
      bed, terrified. Hands in her lap. Faith gives her a smile in the 
      mirror.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Now, normally? I wouldn't 
      be<br/>going with a color this dark, but<br/>I read in some magazine, 
      eight<br/>months in a coma will damage a<br/>girl's natural skin 
      tone.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She uncaps the tube, twists the bottom so 
      lipstick pops up, and applies it luxuriously to her lips.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Good thing pale is in this 
      year.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She smacks her lips together, admires 
      herself, then kisses the mirror, leaving a big sexy lip print.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Or was it last 
      year?<br/>(shakes it off)<br/>Anyway, for real now. I want to<br/>ask you 
      something, and you gotta<br/>promise you'll be honest and not<br/>spare my 
      feelings just because I<br/>could kill you. Promise?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>I promise.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Okay: How do I 
      look?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith turns to face Joyce. She looks 
      fabulous. Raises her eyebrows, awaiting an answer. Joyce thinks about it. 
      Then:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Psychotic.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>I was shooting for "sultry," 
      but<br/>hey. Bet I know what you're<br/>thinking.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Really.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>You're thinking…<br/>(bad 
      drama)<br/>"You'll never get away with this." Warm?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Actually, I was thinking, 
      "My<br/>daughter will kill you soon."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Is that a 
fact?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>More like a 
      bet.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Whoa, you got a pair on 
      you,<br/>Joyce. I like seeing that in a<br/>woman your 
      age.<br/>(then)<br/>Guess you can afford to talk that<br/>way. In the "World 
      According to<br/>Joyce," Buffy's gonna come<br/>crashing through that door 
      any<br/>minute.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith grabs something from the vanity, runs 
      and jumps onto the bed like a little kid. Sits uncomfortably close to 
      Joyce. We see now that she's got a stack of mail in her hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>But look what I 
      found.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith starts flipping through the letters, 
      reading who they're addressed to.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>"Buffy Summers, Buffy 
      Summers,<br/>Buffy…" Lot of letters. She<br/>hasn't been by in a while, 
      huh?<br/>(off Joyce's silence)<br/>And you'd think with a crazy 
      chick<br/>like me on the loose, a crazy<br/>chick with a wicked grudge 
      against<br/>her, no less, she'd call and give<br/>you a heads 
      up.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Faith gets up, paces about the 
      room.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>But Buffy's too into her own 
      deal<br/>to remember dear ol' mom.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>You don't know the first 
      thing<br/>about Buffy. Or me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Don't I? I know what it's 
      like.<br/>You think you matter - you think<br/>you're part of something, and 
      you<br/>get dumped. It's like the whole<br/>world is moving - but 
      you're<br/>stuck. Like those animals in the<br/>tar pits? You're sinking a 
      little<br/>deeper every day, and nobody even<br/>sees…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Were you planning to slit 
      my<br/>throat anytime soon?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Faith doesn't seem to hear her. She 
      paces with growing anger and agitation.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Don't tell me you don't see 
      it,<br/>Joyce. You've served your<br/>purpose. Squirted out the 
      kid,<br/>raised her up and now you might as<br/>well be dead. Nobody 
      cares.<br/>Nobody remembers. Especially<br/>Buffy, the fabulous super 
      hero.<br/>Sooner or later you'll have to<br/>face it - she was over us a 
      long<br/>time ago. Too busy climbing onto<br/>her new boytoy to give a 
      single<br/>thought to the people that matter.<br/>(getting 
      furious)<br/>You're her <u>mother</u> and she just<br/>leaves you here to 
      <u>die</u>.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CRASH! Faith is interrupted as Buffy comes 
      shattering through Joyce's bedroom window and smashes into her. Hard 
      collision. Buffy gets to her feet first. Punches Faith hard in the face. 
      Turns to Joyce.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hi, Mom.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Hi, Honey.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith punches Buffy back. Buffy side-kicks 
      Faith, catching her under the jaw and sending her crashing into the 
      vanity. Faith regains her footing and dives at Buffy, tackling her, the 
      momentum carrying both fighters out the bedroom door and into the hallway. 
      They're gone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce rushes to her phone. Grabs the 
      receiver. Dials "911."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We CUT TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles comes in to his apartment. 
      Double-locks the door behind him. Turns on the light switch, but - no 
      light.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles tenses immediately. But before he can 
      make a move, a silhouetted hand casually reaches up to the overhead lamp 
      above his kitchen table and flicks on the light, revealing:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Three MEN. Sitting around Giles' kitchen 
      table, smoking cigarettes and making themselves a little too at home. They 
      are the three ASSASSINS from the airport. One of them, sporting a nasty 
      old scar above his right eyebrow (this is COLLINS), smiles a wicked 
      smile.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">COLLINS<br/>Hello, 
      Rupert.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles just stands there, mouth open as 
      Collins exhales a lazy plume of cigarette smoke.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S STAIRWELL - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Faith come tumbling down the 
      stairwell together, locked in combat, rolling over one another, neither 
      staying on top for long.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They finally come crashing painfully down 
      into the dining room together.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith rolls over, jostles a table, and the 
      VASE on it falls neatly into her hand. She rolls back, bringing the vase 
      smashing down - right where Buffy was.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's already standing - she kicks Faith 
      in the face. Faith rolls with it, comes up in fight stance.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Thought I'd go after the 
      clean<br/>marine, didn't you? He's a cutie.<br/>Looks like he could use a 
      good<br/>roll in the sack…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy throws a punch. Faith blocks, then 
      counterpunches, catching Buffy in the ribs. Buffy swings back - 
      connects.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You're not his type. He's not 
      big<br/>on sleaze.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She lands a left-right-hook combination, 
      staggering Faith back, toward the dining room entrance. But Faith grabs 
      Buffy by the throat, slams her back into the dining room wall. Holds her 
      there.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>He's probably just never tried 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith pulls back her fist - Buffy breaks the 
      neck-grip just as Faith lands a punch that puts a dent in the wall - Buffy 
      turns to face her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Going for the boyfriend 
      again?<br/>That's tired…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Just something to remember me 
      by<br/>once I've moved on.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith grabs Buffy and shoves her hard and 
      fast…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BAM! The two Slayers hit the dining room 
      table and go sprawling across it, sending candle holders, place mats and 
      dishes flying. Both roll over, onto their feet.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Ever occurred to you that 
      the<br/>reason we all forgot you, Faith,<br/>is 'cause we <u>wanted</u> 
      to?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith, feral, hair splayed over her face, 
      yanks a drawer from the dining room cabinet, pulling it all the way out. 
      Joyce's "good silver" goes clattering to the floor. Spoons, forks - and 
      knives. Some of them glisten - sharp.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith grabs a knife. Grins. She swipes at 
      Buffy, just missing. Buffy backs up. Faith presses the attack. Faith 
      lunges, stabbing. Buffy side-steps and Faith's knife goes plunging into 
      the wall. Buffy grabs Faith's arm and bends it the wrong direction - 
      nearly breaks it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I mean - let's face it - 
      you're a<br/>royal pain in the ass.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Suddenly, we hear the sound of SIRENS, 
      coming this way, growing louder.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>(whispers, to 
      herself)<br/>Cops…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith looks to the living room. Looks back 
      to Buffy. Buffy punches Faith so hard, Faith goes down. She doesn't stay 
      there. Hitting the floor, Faith rolls back like a gymnast and heads back 
      for the living room. Buffy follows, hurdling over the dining room 
      table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith enters, Buffy right behind her. The 
      sirens are blaring louder, and red lights start to flash in the living 
      room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith's P.O.V.: The BOX the Mayor left her 
      sits peacefully on the living room table. Faith runs for it. Buffy tackles 
      her. Faith twists out of Buffy's grip, rolls over backward and kicks Buffy 
      back into the wall. Buffy hits it hard, bringing a few knickknacks 
      shattering to the floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith spots a framed PHOTO of Buffy and 
      Joyce together in happy times. She hurls it backhand, spinning lethally 
      Buffy's way. Buffy - THWAP! - catches it perfectly. And sets the picture 
      of herself and Mom down, undamaged, away from the fight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith grabs the box. Police sirens are now 
      deafening. The whole living room is awash in spinning red light. Faith 
      opens the box.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy grabs Faith, spins her around to face 
      her. Enough of this shit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy PUNCHES Faith.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And PUNCHES her again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith extends her open hand fully out, 
      poising it to strike.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A quick close-up of Faith's hand shows the 
      Mayor's DEVICE strapped to her palm. This is what it's for. Her thumb, 
      forefinger and ring finger fit through the metallic loops. The metallic 
      mechanism rests in her palm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith GRABS Buffy with her open hand, like 
      she's giving her a joy-buzzer from Hell. And the second she makes 
      palm-to-palm contact, a small PULSE WAVE flows out of the two women's 
      hands, extending up to their elbows fast, then dissipating.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It is gone. Both women look stunned for just 
      a moment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy shakes it off first. She gets her 
      bearings on Faith and - BOOM! Punches her a third time, knocking Faith 
      out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy stands over Faith's unconscious body. 
      The police sirens are drowned out by the sound of their screeching tires 
      and radio call-in static. Footsteps. A pounding can be heard on the 
      door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy reaches down and strips the metal 
      device from Faith's hand. Examines it. Joyce comes down the stairs, takes 
      it all and, and comes to stand beside her daughter.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>You okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>All things 
      considered?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She nods.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>What is that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Weapon of some kind. Didn't 
      work,<br/>whatever it was.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She sets the device on the floor and grinds 
      it under her heel, SMASHING it. A small CGI explosion of light emanates 
      out from under the now-broken metal.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Police…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>She's their problem 
      now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>You sure you're all 
      right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy thinks, then answers:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Five-by-five.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks down upon Faith and smiles. We 
      see her lying knocked out cold.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We go to black and the title card tells us 
      this story is…</font></p>
