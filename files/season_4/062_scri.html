<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FADE UP ON:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A pastoral campus tableau. Students sitting 
      on benches talking, looking at a kiosk, milling about.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then, in the background, <u>completely 
      unnoticed</u> by the students, we see BUFFY run scared through the frame - 
      as if her life depended on it. A few beats later we see that she is being 
      pursued by a hungry-looking VAMPIRE, who also runs through 
      frame...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANOTHER ANGLE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where we see that Buffy and the vamp are 
      rapidly leaving behind the heavily traveled path and heading into a more 
      secluded part of the campus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Checks behind her. Sees that they are alone. 
      And stops. Pulls out a stake - cool as a cucumber.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(to vamp)<br/>Thanks for the 
      re-locate. I perform <br/>better without an audience.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The shocked vamp barely has time to react 
      before Buffy lunges at him, ready to make with the dust portion of the 
      program. The vamp fends off her blow and they go at it. He's big and 
      strong - but Buffy's in fine form, enjoying the fight...</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You were thinking 
      what, a little <br/>helpless co-ed before bed? <br/>(throws him)<br/>You know 
      very well: you eat this late--<br/>(he comes at her)<br/>You're gonna 
      get<br/>(stakes him)<br/>heartburn.<br/><br/>He clutches his chest in 
      uncomprehending agony.</font></center>
<p></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Get it? Heart 
      burn?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He dusts.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>That's it? That's all 
      I get?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She starts to exit, blithely 
      complaining.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>One lame-ass vamp 
      with no appreciation <br/>for my painstakingly thought out puns? <br/>I 
      don't even think the forces of darkness <br/>are trying.<br/>(to the 
      world)<br/>You could make a little effort you know... <br/>Give me something 
      to work with, here.</font></center>

      a high stair landing some distance away. His full fury at having lost the 
      Gem of Amarra to Angel informs his every word-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Watch your mouth, little girl. 
      You should <br/>know better than to tempt the fates that <br/>way. Because 
      the Big Bad is back - and <br/>this time, it's 
      GNYAARGGHHLL!!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see that Spike's screams of pain are 
      prompted by the TASER BLOW he's just suffered. He falls to the ground,

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BRONZE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY, WILLOW, OZ, and XANDER are hanging, 
      listening to the music. Oz and Willow are in a cuddly space, as per 
      usual.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It's more fun here this year, 
      isn't it? <br/>The Bronze?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(agreeing)<br/>'Cause of the 
      gloating factor alone. <br/>We're all about college now. <br/>We've got 
      heady discourse...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Curfew free nights of mom and 
      <br/>pop-less hootenanny...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Co-ed dating prospects who 
      find <br/>"townies" sexy and dangerous...<br/>(off Willow's look)<br/>What? I 
      can dream.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Right... So, if college is so 
      great - what <br/>are we doing here and why is it more fun?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Because the Bronze is nice 
      and familiar. <br/>It's like a big comfy blanky.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I was under the impression that I 
      was <br/>your big comfy blanket. </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You're my <u>person</u> 
      blanky. This is my <br/><u>place</u> blanky. With all the shock of the 
      <br/>new it's nice to know that there's one <br/>spot we can come back to 
      where things <br/>are predictable and-<br/><br/>GILES<br/>(interrupting 
      her)<br/>Hello, all.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy starts to rise, on alert.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Giles. 
Trouble?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Oh no - don't get up Buffy. 
      It's nothing <br/>like that. I just thought I'd pop by... <br/>Anybody for a 
      latte? On me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(to Willow)<br/>So much for 
      your predictable blanky <br/>theory, Will.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Everyone makes room for Giles. He 
      sits.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Splendid. It's been ages since 
      I've <br/>been out to hear a band...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The youngsters can't help but share a look. 
      He catches it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES (cont'd)<br/>Don't look that way. 
      I'm quite "with it" <br/>when it comes to music - and I have <br/>the record 
      albums to prove it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(bemused)<br/>But it's your 
      cutting edge 8-tracks that <br/>keep you ahead of the 
scene.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>(to others)<br/>Might want to save 
      the scoffing, gang. <br/>I've seen the collection, and Giles was <br/>an 
      animal in his day.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I guess... If the Stones are 
      still rolling, why can't Giles?<br/><br/>WILLOW<br/>(to Giles)<br/>Exactly, I 
      think it's brave that you're here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(a bit peeved)<br/>Well - thank 
      you, all. You've made <br/>me feel right at home.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Isn't home that empty place 
      you're <br/>trying to escape?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles would reply but he's interrupted as 
      the LIGHTS COME UP ON THE STAGE AREA AND A BAND starts playing a driving, 
      sexual tune. Then VERUCA takes the stage. Whatever she's wearing, it's 
      black and sexy... Willow notes Veruca's entrance, eyes OZ nervously. 
      Buffy, also, is keenly aware of Will's discomfort.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh. Yea... Veruca's playing 
      tonight.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Yeah. Every Wednesday. I told 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz gives Willow a quick smile - tries not to 
      notice that Veruca is, once again, directing much of her act to him. But 
      the pull between them is too strong... His glance toward her becomes a 
      stare. Buffy, protective of Willow, tries to talk over the loud 
      music-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>So Oz, what about you guy? 
      <br/>When's Dingoes playing here again?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Distracted, Oz manages-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>What? Oh - we're up next 
      Friday...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And his eyes return to the stage. Willow, 
      trying to hold it together, grabs Oz' hand. Squeezes it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(anxious/re: band)<br/>They're 
      good, aren't they?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz guiltily forces his attention back to 
      her. Downplays-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Nothing special.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah. She's quell' Fiona. 
      Color <br/>me bored.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Giles, nodding along to the music, 
      offers-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Really? I think she's rather 
      remarkable. <br/>Such a presence for someone her age...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Which is about the wrongest thing he could 
      say at the moment. Even more uncomfortable now - the others turn their 
      attention back to the performance. But Buffy steals sympathetic glances at 
      Willow, as Oz and Veruca dial in on each other again...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Hurt. Trying to pretend she's not 
      noticing.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FADE TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. OZ' ROOM - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The next AM. Oz and Willow sleep, snuggled 
      together. Willow, looking pretty darn cute in a big t-shirt, starts to 
      whimper, agitate... Finally calls out-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It's in the 
      sandblaster!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz, woken by this, smiles before his eyes 
      even open.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>What's the sandblaster, 
      Will?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Willow doesn't answer, just whimpers... 
      Oz pulls her closer to him. Gently nuzzles her ear, saying-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ (cont'd)<br/>It's a dream... Come 
      back to me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">His hands move under covers. Whatever he's 
      doing is waking her in a most pleasant fashion.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hmmmmmm....<br/>(grins)<br/>Ooooooh....<br/>(then)<br/>All 
      Geminis to the raspberry hats!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Now you're 
faking.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Am not.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But she turns around so she's facing him. 
      Opens her eyes.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Just a 
      little.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Morning.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Morning.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Bad dream?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I guess. But the waking up 
      part <br/>makes up for it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They smile. He moves some hair from her 
      forehead. Taps her head tenderly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>It's always so busy in 
      there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(suggestively)<br/>Not always. 
      A few things shut my <br/>brain up completely.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Anything I can help you 
      with?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I have to get to class right 
      now. <br/>But tonight, for sure.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I don't know about tonight. 
      Unless the <br/>extreme Jerry Garcia look turns you on.<br/>(off her puzzled 
      look)<br/>Night before the full moon.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh! That's right. And I have 
      a thing... <br/>There's a wicca group on campus I <br/>wanted to check out, 
      they have <br/>orientation on the three nights you're <br/>wolfy. It's 
      probably totally silly, but-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>(cutting her off)<br/>Go. Show 
      them how it's done.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Are you sure? You can lock 
      yourself up? <br/>I mean, it's only this one month. After <br/>orientation 
      they meet on different nights-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Will, I'll be 
      fine.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay... As long as you don't 
      mind.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>The only part I mind is being 
      away <br/>from your for three nights.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And he kisses her sweetly. The weirdness of 
      the night before forgotten. They're totally comfy again. Totally 
      adoring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LECTURE HALL/HALL - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's heading out for Psych 101 after 
      class. MAGGIE stands near her desk, handing back papers. Buffy, not 
      thrilled at the prospect of a face to face with her, quickly takes her 
      paper and makes for the door. But Maggie stops her with-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH<br/>Ms. Summers. I want you 
      to prepare <br/>to lead a discussion group next class <br/>on the paper 
      topic.<br/>(re: Buffy's paper)<br/>That was smart work.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It - I... What do 
      I-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH<br/>You have any questions, 
      bring them <br/>up with one of the TA's.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Maggie turns her attention back to her 
      business with the other students, dismissing her. Now Willow meets up with 
      Buffy - sees Buffy's stunned look as they exit into the hall.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Are you okay? How'd you 
      do?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy just hands Willow her paper. Willow 
      reads - then looks back at Buffy, thrilled for her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>That's good... I 
      mean, that's excellent!<br/>(her face falls)<br/>You did better than me... 
      This is so unfair.<br/>(thrilled again)<br/>You made me jealous of you - 
      <br/>academically! Buffy!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know - can you believe 
      it!?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They hug.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Guess Ms. Walsh isn't so 
      ogrey after all.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Except now she wants me to 
      lead a <br/>discussion group next class. Which <br/>means more work, right? 
      Shouldn't <br/>she have a better reward system? <br/>Like a cookie? Or maybe 
      a little toy, <br/>like at the dentist?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(blown away)<br/>She wants you 
      to lead a discussion group? <br/>Okay - jealous again. Jealous, jealous... 
      <br/>I'm back.<br/>(then)<br/>I'm meeting Oz at the café. You want to 
      <br/>come? I'll get you your celebratory cookie.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Great. I'm TA bound - but I'll 
      catch <br/>up with you guys. </font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With that they each move happily 
      off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. OUTDOOR CAFÉ - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The place is hopping. Oz, coffee in hand, 
      looks for a place to sit. There isn't a free table anywhere. Then he 
      stops, sensing-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who sits with her lunch at the table near 
      him. Again, she's got the baby rock star look working. And she's staring 
      at him like she's been expecting him. Oz hesitates.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>What are you going to do? Sit 
      on <br/>the ground?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>My girlfriend's 
      coming.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>There's room.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz relents - sits at her table. Notices her 
      rather huge hamburger and large basket of fries. </font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Big lunch. </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>(shrugs)<br/>I like to eat. I

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Agreed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They meet eyes now, and the vibe between

      to come together - <br/>but the amps still sound dirty to 
      me...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>What are you using? 50 or 
      120?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON ANOTHER AREA OF THE CAFÉ 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where Willow arrives, sees them talking 
      intently. Her face falls. She almost walks off. But she stops and collects 
      herself. Approaches them with forced good cheer.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hey!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz makes room for Willow. Gives her a kiss. 
      Veruca nods to her, not unkindly. </font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>Hey...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There is an awkward moment of silence. Then 
      Oz channels his discomfort back into the technical conversation with 
      Veruca.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>You should be using 50. And Blue 
      <br/>Voodoo isn't your best bet if you don't <br/>dig the 
      distort.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Music talk, huh? Cool. I love 
      to listen <br/>to Oz talk about "the biz."</font></center>

      Dog...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow, desperate to weigh in, 
      offers-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Me too! That was a great 
      song. I mean, <br/>Elvis - what a guy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>(bemused)<br/>You a big Elvis 
      fan?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>The biggest. Well, I mean, 
      after Dingoes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>We were actually talking 
      amps...<br/>(off Will's embarrassment)<br/>But it's easy to get confused, 
      with the <br/>names they give them.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There is another awkward beat. Willow can't 
      help but sense the energy that suffuses Oz and Veruca's silences - and she 
      feels like she's dying a thousand deaths... Finally, Oz decides he can't 
      hang. Squeezes Willow's arm.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>(to both of them)<br/>I have to 
      bail.<br/>(to Willow)<br/>Call me later.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz goes, leaving a wildly uncomfortable 
      Willow and Veruca together. A beat. Willow's about to talk 
when-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>I should go too. Good 
      shirt.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Veruca bails and Willow looks down at her 
      pink and fuzzy Custo-type top. Feels even more foolish. Then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (O.C.)<br/>Check the rapid exits. 
      Was it me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow, crestfallen, looks up to see Buffy 
      standing near her with her coffee. Buffy takes a seat.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Me. I don't speak 
      "muscianese."<br/>(then)<br/>Why didn't you tell me I look like a <br/>crazy 
      birthday cake in this shirt?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh. I thought that was the 
      point.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Buffy can see that Willow is really 
      upset - near tears.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>He thinks she's sexy. He gets 
      this blushy <br/>thing going on behind his ears. That's <br/>for me 
      only.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(sympathetic)<br/>It doesn't 
      mean anything, Will. So Oz <br/>checks another girl. He loves 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow nods. Trying to convince 
      herself.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I know. I know. And I don't 
      want to be <br/>the kind of girl who freaks every time <br/>my boyfriend 
      notices someone else - <br/>even if she is throwing herself at him <br/>like 
      a twenty dollar ho...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Please. Ten dollar ho. 
      Fifteen, max.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I mean, I have wrong feelings 
      for other <br/>guys sometimes...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You have them. But you don't 
      act <br/>on them.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No. In fact, I feel guilty 
      about them. I flog and punish.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>See? I'm sure Oz is flogging 
      and <br/>punishing himself-<br/>(stops)<br/>This is sounding so wrong before 
      I <br/>even finish.<br/>(then)<br/>Point is - you're both human. But I 
      <br/>promise you, in a few days it'll be <br/>like - Veruca 
      who?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You think?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Absolutely. Oz just isn't the 
      type to stray.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(still worried)<br/>Not 
      tonight, anyway. He'll be locked <br/>in a cage...</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CRYPT - DUSK</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz enters an old crypt, which he and the 
      others have converted into a CAGE by drilling a wall of bars into the 
      stone. There is a door in the wall of bars that Oz now moves through. He 
      closes the door and it locks automatically. (The row of buttons under the 
      knob hold a combination Oz can reach around and do once he's 
      unwolfed.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Maggie moves down the dimly lit walkway, 
      enjoying the fresh air. Stops when she HEARS SOMETHING MOVE in the bushes 
      nearby. A beat passes - then she keeps walking. But the noise persists.

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH<br/>Hello?</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">No reply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Really scared now, Maggie heads for the 
      distant parking lot as fast as she can... But the faster she moves - the 
      faster the thing moves. Maggie breaks into a run. It's no use. One of the 
      bushes ahead leaps OZ WOLF. Snarling, hideous - and hungry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Maggie SCREAMS and takes off in the opposite 
      direction. She's actually pretty damn fast, but she's no match for OZ WOLF 
      - who gains on her rapidly. Desperate, Maggie tosses her briefcase at the 
      creature, to little effect. Then she tries a fake, taking a corner at the

      petrified, looks behind her to see Oz Wolf coming around the corner. She's 
      surrounded. For a horrible, blood curdling moment, she contemplates the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And indeed wolves attack - EACH OTHER. It 
      appears that their interest in Maggie is secondary to their desire to tear 
      the crap out of one another. Maggie takes a moment to comprehend the

      seeing her. The most significant being overwhelming guilt.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Hey. New look.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(re: his outfit)<br/>You 
      too.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz takes a beat to get what she's talking 
      about. Then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Oh. Laundry day... kinda came and 
      went.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow puts her stuff down. They hug, but 
      it's off... awkward.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hey. I'm sorry if I was weird 
      yesterday. <br/>With you and Veruca.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>(tighter)<br/>I didn't notice 
      anything.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You didn't? Cause I felt all 
      spazzy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>No.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow tries to take heart at this. She 
      moves closer to him, her tone growing flirtatious.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh. Good. Guess I've been 
      worrying <br/>for nothing again. Me and my busy 
      head...<br/>(hinting)<br/>Always thinking, thinking, 
      thinking...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Now you can stop. Everything's 
      fine.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow realizes she's not getting her 
      message across.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well. Maybe you can... help 
      me stop.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Oz gets it. This is not good.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I've got about half 
      an hour...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow starts to rub his back sensually. His 
      shirt lifts up and we see - although she does not - the SCRATCH MARKS ON 
      HIS BACK. </font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>And I'd really, 
      really appreciate <br/>anything you can do.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She leans in, kisses him... It causes such a 
      pang of remorse in Oz that he turns his head away. Willow is 
      stricken.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>What? What's 
      wrong?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Sorry, I-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You don't want 
      to?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>It's not that. I do. 
      But...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow, hurt, stands.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No. It's fine. I don't have 
      that much <br/>time anyway-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>It's just - I didn't sleep at all 
      I guess. <br/>I'm really beat.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">All Willow wants to do is get out of 
      there.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Right. Busy wolf night. Got 
      it. <br/>It's totally okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She gathers her stuff, heads for the 
      door.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Will. You don't have 
      to-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No. I should. I'll see you 
      later.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And she bails, leaving Oz feeling worse than 
      he ever imagined possible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We find Giles at his desk - but he's moved 
      his TV on top of it. He's got a book open, but it's a sham. He's 
      completely in the grip of a Jeopardy type program and talks at the 
      screen-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Treaty of 
      Westphalia!</font></center>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Moron. That dinette set should 
      be mine.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Fortunately, the doorbell rings - saving him 
      from himself. He snaps the set off and rushes to answer. When he does, 
      he's just a little too thrilled to see Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES (cont'd)<br/>Buffy. Excellent! 
      Come in.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hi...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Can I get you anything? Some 
      tea? <br/>I made an interesting mousaka last <br/>night if you're 
      hungry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Pass on the tea. And the 
      moose. But thanks.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>So. You come on business, I 
      hope?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yep. Lucky for you, people may 
      be <br/>in danger.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I didn't... I only meant - I'm 
      at the ready.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Buffy eyes the TV on Giles' desk. Goes 
      over and feels that it is warm on top. He avoids her knowing 
      look.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Clearly - we need to get you 
      kicking <br/>some monster bootie, stat. So check it - <br/>one of my 
      professors said she almost got <br/>attacked by two wild "dogs" last night. 
      <br/>Under the light of a nearly full moon.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Werewolves? Two of 
      them?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Could be.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I didn't see anything about 
      attacks in <br/>the paper or on the news. Have you <br/>spoken to 
      Oz?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>He's my next 
      stop.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Yes. Get right on that. And 
      I'll see <br/>what I can find out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy starts to go. Giles calls after her 
      eagerly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES (cont'd)<br/>And you'll report 
      back to me-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(finishing for him)<br/>ASAP. 
      Promise.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. XANDER'S BASEMENT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander sits on his futon, going through the 
      help wanted ads. Then WILLOW appears at the bottom of the basement 
      steps.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Hey, Will. Mom let you 
      in?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Uh huh... Seemed a little 
      cranky.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>We're having a little 
      landlord/tenant <br/>dispute, so I'm withholding rent. An <br/>effective - 
      and might I add thrifty - tactic.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>How come?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>She won't let me put a lock 
      on my door. <br/>I suspect she's afraid I'll start having <br/>"the 
      sex."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yeah. Parents wait until 
      you're out <br/>of the house-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Or under it-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Or under it - to start worry 
      about that <br/>stuff. And it's mostly too late...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She smiles a little sadly. It's clear she's 
      on a bummer.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>So I know why I'm sitting 
      around in a <br/>dank, sunless little room - but why you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I just... Things with Oz are 
      weird. I <br/>talked with Buffy, but I have a feeling <br/>we're in 
      guy-ville... Like I need a <br/>translator from the Y wide of 
      things.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Last time I checked I had the 
      creds. <br/>Hit me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What does it mean when a girl 
      wants <br/>to... you know...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>If you're doing it I think 
      you should <br/>be able to say it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Make love...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Wild monkey love or tender 
      Sarah <br/>McLachlan love?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Any kind. But what if the 
      girl wants <br/>to and the guy doesn't? That's a bad <br/>sign, 
      right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Could be. Or the girl caught 
      the guy in <br/>one of the 7 annual minutes when he's <br/>legitimately too 
      preoccupied to do it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But say, the girl has been 
      noticing-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Will? I think I've deciphered 
      your <br/>ingenious code.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh. Say I've been noticing Oz 
      notice <br/>somebody else. A woman.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>And this chick is noticing 
      back?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Most 
      definitely.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Well... Have you asked Oz 
      about it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Thought about it. But then 
      he'll think <br/>I'm all jealous and worried.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>But you <u>are</u>. And odds 
      are he feels it. <br/>I bet that's all there is to the weird <br/>you're 
      feeling.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow takes this in. Sees the wisdom in 
      it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay. Now that you said that 
      - I knew it. <br/>How come I didn't <u>know</u> I knew it <br/>before you 
      said it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Love. It's a logic 
      blocker.<br/>(then)<br/>Talk it out with him, Will. You'll <br/>both feel 
      better.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OFF WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Vaguely more hopeful.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CRYPT - DAY</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz is welding a sturdy new HINGE onto 
      his cage door. Now a shadow falls near him. He turns. Buffy's standing 
      over him.<br/><br/>BUFFY<br/>Got out, huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Yeah... Any news about 
      attacks?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No. But I did hear about a 
      person being <br/>chased by <u>two</u> "wild dogs."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Two? Really?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He looks at her - and she glimpses more fear 
      and worry in his expression than she's ever seen before.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You don't remember anything 
      like that, <br/>do you? Another wolf?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>(shakes his head)<br/>As soon as 
      the change comes - I'm <br/>gone. It's like a total 
      blackout.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Must be 
spooky.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>It is.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">That's the extent of his confession. He 
      turns back to the cage.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ (cont'd)<br/>Do me a 
      favor?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Sure.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Give this thing a 
      go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy nods. Gives the cage a few good hits 
      and kicks.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Seems good to 
      me...<br/>(then/teasingly)<br/>If I find werewolf #2 on patrol tonight - 
      <br/>you may have a roomie.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz can't muster a smile for that one. 
      Manages-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Thanks.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy starts to leave - but stops before she 
      hits the door.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oz?<br/>(off his look)<br/>Are 
      you alright? If possible, you seem <br/>even more monosyllabic than 
      usual.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I'm okay. Thanks.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CRYPT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Back to the terribleness of that last 
      moment. Willow's pinched cry and the sound of her thermos clattering on 
      the cold stone floor wake both Oz and Veruca. Oz is horrified, but Veruca 
      looks as if she's enjoying Willow's realization.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Willow-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow turns her back to them, raises 
      shaking hands to her face.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh my God... Oh my 
      God...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Behind her, Oz scrambles to get dressed. 
      Veruca leisurely locates her long coat, which is still intact... Oz does 
      the combo on the lock and exits the cage. Moves to Willow.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I know what you saw. It was... I 
      had to - <br/>I had to lock her up with me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow looks at him, trembling with shock 
      and upset, scoffs-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I bet. </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>She's like me. A 
      wolf.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Veruca appears at the door of the cage, 
      buttoning the coat - which is all she has on. Willow, crying now, turns 
      away again - can't look.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(laughs darkly)<br/>Well, I 
      knew you two had a lot in <br/>common, but...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz moves to touch her, calm her... But 
      Willow, surprising herself, yells-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/><u>Don't</u> touch 
      me!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>She was going to hurt somebody. 
      <br/>I didn't have a choice-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(cutting him off)<br/>But you 
      did! You could have told somebody. <br/>Your "solution" conveniently put 
      you <br/>two alone together all night.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz balks - while Veruca smiles at this. Says 
      to Oz-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>Girl's got a 
      point.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz angrily turns on her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Leave.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>I was just 
      saying-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/><u>Now</u>!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Veruca clearly bruised by his dismissal. 
      Grabs the last of her things and bolts. There's a beat after she goes. 
      Willow is sobbing. Oz, pained and desperate, can only say-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ (cont'd)<br/>I'm 
      sorry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Why didn't you talk to me? I 
      knew. <br/>I <u>knew</u>, you jerk! And you sat there, <br/>telling me 
      everything was fine? <br/>That's as bad as... As...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She gestures toward the cage. But Oz' 
      expression darkens a bit at her words. He's been on the other side of 
      it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I know how it feels. I 
      remember.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh, so, what? This is 
      payback? I had <br/>this coming.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>No. That's not-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(cutting him off)<br/>Because 
      I thought that was behind us. <br/>And you know what happened with 
      <br/>Xander - it doesn't compare. Not with <br/>what you and I had - and not 
      with <br/><u>whatever</u> you've been doing with her.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I don't know what Veruca and I 
      have <br/>done. When I change - it's like I'm <br/>gone and the wolf takes 
      over.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow considers this. Then, afraid, she has 
      to ask -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But before this, when you 
      were just <br/>regular Oz - you had feelings for her, <br/>didn't 
      you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I could sense something, yes. 
      But-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She interrupts him, realizing-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But - you wanted her. Like, 
      in an <br/>animal way.<br/>(pained)<br/>Like - more than you wanted 
      me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He can't deny it. She understands his 
      silence fully before he can think of something that will make it even 
      remotely better. She takes off, devastated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GRAVEYARD - 
      DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow runs hard - trying to outrun the 
      growing pain in her chest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE STREET - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Willow moves down the main street of 
      Sunnydale, unable to stop crying. It's a busy day, people and cars 
      everywhere - but she seems oblivious to it all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANOTHER ANGLE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where we see BUFFY walking on the opposite 
      side of the street. As soon as she catches sight of Willow, she can tell 
      something is terribly wrong.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Unaware of Buffy, moves to cross the street. 
      She steps off the sidewalk - directly into the PATHWAY OF AN ONCOMING 
      CAR.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Starts to run, ,but she's too far away to 
      help.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Willow!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Turns at the sound of Buffy's voice. Doesn't 
      see the car barreling down on her. She's seconds away from being road-kill 
      when WHOOSH! - a pair of strong hands grab her and jerk her back to the 
      safety of the sidewalk. Stunned, she looks up to see RILEY holding 
      her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Willow? Are you 
      okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow just looks at him. Finally shakes her 
      head - no. Now Buffy runs up beside them. Looks to Riley 
      gratefully.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Thank you. I was too far 
      away-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>It was lucky. She almost 
      got...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(to Will)<br/>Willow. What's 
      the matter?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow is silent. She can't talk or she'll 
      lose it again.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Maybe you should get her 
      home.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy nods. Riley looks to Willow 
      kindly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY (cont'd)<br/>Whatever it is, be 
      more careful - okay? <br/>I promise - it's not worth hurting <br/>yourself 
      over.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow barely nods. Then Buffy and Willow 
      move off, Buffy mouthing a silent "thank you" to a concerned 
      Riley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY AND WILLOW'S DORM ROOM - 
      DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's later in the day. Buffy has heard the 
      whole horrible tale from Willow and has been ministering to her... Willow 
      sits on her bed, dry-eyed - but pretty shell-shocked.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I have to go. I have to find 
      Veruca <br/>before the sun sets.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow nods. Buffy starts to gather her 
      stuff.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>(firmly)<br/>I will, 
      though. And when I do this <br/>thing <u>stops</u>. She's bad news. 
      <br/>(then)<br/>Can I get you something before I take <br/>off? Kleenex? 
      Chocolate-y chocolate <br/>anything?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'll come back as soon as 
      things are <br/>taken care of. You just take it easy, 
      okay?<br/>(then)<br/>Riley was right. The main thing is - <br/>put the blame 
      where it belongs. <br/>Don't hurt yourself.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow takes this in. Nods. Buffy starts to 
      go.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She stops - nervous mother hen 
      style.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You're 
      okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'm fine. 
      Promise.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And Buffy takes off. After she goes we move 
      in close on Willow and see from her wild eyes that she's not okay in the 
      least. She nods again... Repeats Buffy's words.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Put the blame where 
      it belongs.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She gets up and drags a trunk from next to 
      her bed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON TRUNK</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow opens it. Revealing all manner of 
      SPELL MATERIAL.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. OZ' ROOM - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz is on the phone, finishing a 
      conversation.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>You haven't seen her around? 
      <br/>Okay. Thanks man.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He hangs up, worried. Then a perfunctory 
      knock announces Buffy, who steps into the room. She gets right to 
      it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Where is she?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I don't know. I already tried her 
      usual haunts.<br/>(then)<br/>But - I know the areas we're drawn to, <br/>and 
      I'm pretty sure I can follow her scent.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>We'll try that, 
      then.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy starts out. But Oz stops 
      her-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Look. You should just know 
      that-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(cutting him off)<br/>Oz. This 
      might be a good time for <br/>your trademark stoicism.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz takes this in. Nods. They move 
      out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CAMPUS LAB - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow has set up in an empty lab. She has a 
      fire going over a burner and all manner of nasty spell stuff laid out 
      before her. She starts mixing ingredients and begins an incantation - its 
      clear intent being to harm Oz and Veruca. </font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I conjure thee, by Barabbas, 
      by Satanas, <br/>and the Devil As thou art burning, <br/>let Oz' and 
      Veruca's deceitful hearts <br/>be broken.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With these words the FLAME RISES.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. WOODS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz and Buffy, now armed with a tranquilizer 
      gun, troop through the woods. The light is growing gold and soft as the 
      end of the day nears. Oz stops, breathes in Then determines a 
      direction.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>This way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He moves off. Buffy follows.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CAMPUS LAB - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow's spell gets more involved She 
      tosses more ingredients into the growing fire. Willow is really into it, 
      all her rage and pain pouring into the majik. </font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I conjure thee by the Saracen 
      Queen, <br/>and by the name of hell. Let them <br/>know no love or solace, 
      let them <br/>find no peace as well.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow appears infused with energy and a few 
      small objects around her, beakers and test tubes and such, start to 
      FLOAT.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. WOODS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz and Buffy continue their hunt, closing 
      in</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>She's right near here. I can 
      smell her.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then Buffy, turned away from him, 
      offers-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Or the dirty pile of clothes 
      she left <br/>lying on the ground. </font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz moves to her. Sure enough, they are 
      Veruca's clothes.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>They could be from the other 
      night <br/>when she-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy shoots him a warning look. But he 
      continues.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ (cont'd)<br/>-turned into a 
      werewolf.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Unless she <u>wanted</u> to 
      throw you off <br/>the scent.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They think for a moment. Look at each 
      other.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Willow.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">That's it. They take off running back toward 
      campus, each on slightly different paths Oz leading a bit</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Putting on the gas. She dodges a big tree 
      and slams into one of the MYSTERIOUS TASER GUYS, who is just as surprised 
      as she is. The impact sends them both sprawling to the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CAMPUS LAB - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow nears the end of her spell. The 
      energy building, things still going floaty. She takes a photo of Oz from 
      her pile of ingredients.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Let this image seal his fate, 
      not to <br/>love - but only hate...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But as she moves to add his picture to the 
      fire, she makes the mistake of really looking at it. She stops, stricken. 
      Then tries again to cast it into the flame - but it's too late. She can't 
      go through with it. She starts to cry all over again. The spell is 
      broken... The bad mojo drains from the room and the floaty objects fall to 
      the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then a sarcastic voice breaks her tearful 
      silence-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA (O.C.)<br/>Wow. For a minute 
      there I thought <br/>you might actually play rough.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow turns to see Veruca in the 
      doorway.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>Sometimes you have to, you 
      know, <br/>to keep what's yours.<br/>(darkly)<br/>Sometimes you have to 
      kill.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Veruca closes and BLOCKS the door. It's 
      the only way in or out of the room. She looks out the window.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA (cont'd)<br/>Well what do you 
      know? Sun's <br/>almost down.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, just recovering from her fall, sees 
      the MYSTERY MAN already up and disappearing into the woods. She looks for 
      Oz, but sees that he is gone too. Frustrated, she scrambles to her feet 
      and takes off in the direction Oz went.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CAMPUS LAB - DUSK</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow and Veruca face off. Willow is 
      shaking with rage and fear, and Veruca is relishing every moment of 
      it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>Can't say I'm surprised you 
      didn't go <br/>through with your little hex. You don't<br/>have the

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You don't know what I have.

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow's heard enough. In tears, she tries 
      to dart past Veruca to the door - but Veruca catches her with a vicious 
      back hand. Sends her sprawling. Willow falls hard, dazed.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA (cont'd)<br/>Go ahead and cry - 
      but you should <br/>have seen this coming. You can't tame <br/>a wild thing. 
      He's not yours any more. <br/>He's in you, he'd be thinking about me - 
      <br/>no. Not thinking. It's deeper than that.<br/>(then)<br/>Why don't you

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She'd go on but the door behind her is 
      KICKED OPEN and OZ enters, breathless and enraged. He and Veruca square

      rough, remember?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The sun has faded completely from the room 
      now and the change begins (in an acting, non make-up way - we see it 
      register on Oz' face, in his movement...)</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>You want to hurt me, hurt me. 
      <br/>But leave her out of this.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>How can I? She's the reason 
      you're <br/>living in cages. She's blinding you! <br/>When she's gone, 
      you'll be able to <br/>admit what you are-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON: OZ as Veruca circles behind him. 
      He morphs to first stage and when she comes from behind him (talking all 
      the while) she too is in first stage.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>You don't want to find out what I 
      am.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VERUCA<br/>You're an animal. Animals 
      kill.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz looks at Willow and for a moment there is 
      a gleam of hungry pleasure at her fear.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>You're right.<br/>(he turns to 
      Veruca)<br/>We kill.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He LEAPS at Veruca.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And Veruca and Oz fight viciously in their 
      mostly human forms. But before long the f<u>ull transformation overcomes 
      them both</u>. Willow turns away and shuts her ears against the sounds of 
      Oz and Veruca's bodies as they twist and crack. Meanwhile, Veruca and Oz 
      continue to battle throughout the grotesque metamorphosis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she huddles in a corner. The wolves 
      blocking her exit. This is a bad dream...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON VERUCA AND OZ</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As the battle continues and Oz Wolf gains 
      the advantage. He gets a jaw lock on Veruca's neck and violently BITES 
      HER. She SHRIEKS WITH PAIN, a horrible death knell...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">When he is finished, and Veruca's body lies 
      inert, Oz Wolf turns toward Willow. His maw is bloodied and his eyes are 
      the cold eyes of a killer - there is no recognition there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who turns - faces the giant beast crouching 
      low in front of her, baring its razor-like teeth. Nearly out of her mind 
      with grief and terror now, she says in a tiny voice-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oz?..</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She reaches a trembling hand out, as if to 
      stroke him... Without missing a beat - OZ LUNGES toward her, going for the 
      kill. But he is SNATCHED away from Willow only milliseconds before her 
      certain death.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANOTHER ANGLE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And we see that BUFFY has arrived just in 
      time. The gun is slung on her back - no time to go for it. She has Oz Wolf 
      by the hind legs and drags him away from Willow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There is a brief fight between slayer and 
      wolf. But Buffy manages to kick him upside the head, dazing him long 
      enough to use the tranquilizer gun and sedate him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat as OZ WOLF stumbles, then passes out. 
      Then Buffy rushes to Willow and gathers her into her arms. They don't 
      speak, just hold onto each other...</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DISSOLVE TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - DAY</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Giles sit at his dining room 
      table, having tea. The mood is subdued.<br/><br/>GILES<br/>I'm not sure I 
      understand.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>There was so much going on 
      with Oz <br/>and Will - there still is - but I thought <br/>you should know 
      about this.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>So this fellow in the woods - 
      he was <br/>in military garb?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And he was toting some serious 
      weaponry...<br/>(then)<br/>Thing is, I saw some other guys dressed 
      <br/>exactly like him on Halloween night. <br/>I assumed they were in 
      costume...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>But maybe they were 
      working.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I wanna know what's up. Guy 
      got in <br/>my way; I almost didn't catch up to <br/>Oz in time. As it is, I 
      was too late to...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>You saved 
      Willow.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I think right now she wishes I 
      hadn't... <br/>I've never seen her like this before, <br/>Giles. It's like 
      it hurts too much to <br/>even form words.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>But you've felt that way 
      yourself, <br/>and you got through it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well, I ran away and went to 
      hell - and <br/>then I got through it. I'm kind of hoping <br/>Willow won't 
      use me as a model.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Fair enough.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I just don't know how they're 
      gonna <br/>deal with this.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles has no reply. They sit in 
      silence.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DISSOLVE TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. OZ' ROOM - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The room appears empty except for a duffle 
      bag on the bed. There's a knock on the door and then Willow, looking 
      exhausted and scared, pokes her head in.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hello?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz moves out of his closet, a pile of 
      clothes in his arms. He looks at her evenly - his manner full of pained 
      resolve.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Hi.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow, numb with fear, knows exactly what's 
      happening. But she has to ask. Has to hear him say it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What are you 
      doing?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I'm going.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Now?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz nods.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>That's - that's your 
      solution?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>That's my 
      decision.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Don't I get any say in 
      this?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>No.<br/>(then)<br/>Veruca was right 
      about something. <br/>The wolf is inside me all the time. And <br/>I don't 
      know where the line is anymore - <br/>between me and it. Until I figure out 
      <br/>what that means, I shouldn't be around <br/>you - or 
      anybody.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>That could be a problem. 
      'Cause, people? <br/>Pretty much a planetary epidemic.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz stuffs the rest of his things into his 
      duffle bag.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I'll find 
      someplace.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well how long 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I don't know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He closes his bag and turns to her. A beat 
      as it sinks in. For both of them. This is goodbye. Maybe 
      forever.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(desperate)<br/>Oz... Don't 
      you love me...?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>My whole life, I've never loved 
      <br/>anything else.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She starts to cry. A long beat. It's killing 
      Oz to do this, but it's the only way. Finally, he reaches out to her - 
      tentatively. She doesn't stop him. He kisses her forehead. And then they 
      stay like that, forehead to forehead, for a long time.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh God... 
      Oz...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Finally, Oz knows he won't go if he waits 
      another moment. He kisses her again quickly - one last time - then grabs 
      his bag and leaves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. OZ' HOUSE - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz exits his house and gets into his 
      van.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. OZ' VAN - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz starts the van. Hesitates... Turns the 
      key and stops the van...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. OZ' ROOM - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow stands crying exactly where he left 
      her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. OZ' VAN - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz finds his resolve. He starts the van 
      again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. OZ' HOUSE - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The van travels down the road, turns - and 
      is gone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. OZ' ROOM - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Watching her tears stain the carpet... Her 
      heart breaking...</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BLACK OUT.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">END OF SHOW</font></center>
