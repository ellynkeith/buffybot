WILLOW'S DORM ROOM -- NIGHT (DAY 1) <br/><br/>The lights are off, save Buffy's 
bedside that throws a romantic glow over the two on the bed. <br/><br/>Buffy and 
Riley are kissing. Like good cocoa, it's both hot and sweet. They pause, 
speaking between kisses... <br/><br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>We're not expecting anyone, are we? <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Willow 
said she was gonna be at <br/>the science library all night. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Is 
that right? <br/></center><br/><br/>They kiss, hard, Riley starting to pull up 
Buffy's shirt -- and Willow bursts in. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Apparently not. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>We got trouble. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>What's up? <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>I was in the rec room... came 
<br/>in through the window... <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Vampire? <br/><br/>WILLOW 
<br/>Vampires don't breathe fire. <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. HALL OUTSIDE REC ROOM 
-- MOMENTS LATER -- NIGHT <br/><br/>The three of them move quickly toward the rec 
room, Buffy with her weapons bag. She pulls out a crossbow, hands it to Riley as 
they talk. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>I should call for back up. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>No time. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>She indicates the far door. Riley heads for it. Buffy comes 
to the near door, whispering with Willow as she puts her hand on the knob. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>I wanna make this fast. I really <br/>had better 
things to do tonight <br/>than kill. <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. DORM REC ROOM -- 
CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT <br/><br/>Buffy flings the door open, hand on an axe in her 
bag. <br/><br/>Suddenly, the lights come on. Giles, Xander, Anya and approximately 
10 N.D. dorm mates jump out from behind couches, pinball machines... 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>CHORUS OF VOICES <br/>SURPRISE!! <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy stops in her 
tracks, hand coming out of the bag. <br/><br/>ANGLE: RILEY enters from the other 
door, equally surprised, and stashing her crossbow behind a chair. 
<br/><br/>Willow comes up next to the speechless Buffy. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>WILLOW <br/>Guess you won't be killing <br/>anything tonight after all. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>(smile plastered on her face) <br/>Don't be so sure...

1) <br/><br/>Buffy's birthday party. Music plays. People talk and laugh and eat. A 
ping-pong table is loaded with soda and a "Happy Birthday Buffy" cake. Buffy and 
Willow are cutting the cake. <br/><br/>Giles, Xander and Anya stand to one side 
and watch the party. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>This is rather like an activities <br/>room we had back at 
public school. <br/>One time I got up to a bit of a <br/>prank with the dart 
board-- <br/><br/>ANYA <br/>(to Xander) <br/>I'm bored. Let's eat. <br/><br/>XANDER 
<br/>Anya! We talked about this. <br/><br/>ANYA <br/>(to Giles) <br/>I'm sorry. That 
was rude. Please <br/>continue your story. I hope it <br/>involves treacle and a 
headmaster. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Go eat. <br/></center><br/><br/>Xander smiles 
apologetically at Giles as Anya drags him away. Giles looks a little lost until 
Willow joins him. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>WILLOW <br/>Hey, Giles. Having a good time? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Yes. There 
are a lot of new faces <br/>here, aren't there? <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Uh-huh. Mostly 
from the dorm. <br/>And a couple of Riley's friends. <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy 
joins them, Riley in tow. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Hey, Giles. <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles gives Buffy a warm hug. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Happy Birthday. Nineteen. It's <br/>Hard to believe, isn't it? 
I-- <br/></center><br/><br/>He might be about to say more, but Buffy is impatient. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Giles, I want you to meet someone. <br/>This is Riley Finn. My 
boyfriend. <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy sneaks a quick glance back at Riley, 
checking how he's reacting. He's beaming. Buffy beams. Willow beams. Giles is 
taken aback. This is the first he's hearing of this. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>(shakes his hand) <br/>Very nice to meet you, Mr. Giles. 
<br/>Did you help plan this? It was <br/>quite a surprise. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>First 
of many. You've been... <br/>dating long? <br/></center><br/><br/>Someone taps on 
Willow's arm, pulls her into a neighboring conversation. She steps away. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>(to Riley) <br/>Giles used to be the librarian at <br/>my high 
school. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>I've seen the library. It's gone <br/>downhill since 
you left. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>(laughs) <br/>Yes. I'm embarrassed to say I 
<br/>actually miss it at times. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>So, you're retired? 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>Sorry? <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>(mistake...) <br/>Or, you're working 
somewhere <br/>else now? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Well, not... between projects just 
<br/>now, personal... <br/></center><br/><br/>Riley tries to help. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>Oh, I know how that is. My dad <br/>was out of work a while 
back. He <br/>sells farm equipment. It was rough. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>I see. 
<br/><br/>RILEY <br/>He was great about it though -- <br/>didn't want to, you know, 
lie <br/>around the house, watching TV-- <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Riley! Look at this. 
Giles <br/>doesn't have any cake! <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Oh, hey. I'll get you a 
piece. <br/></center><br/><br/>Riley moves away. <br/><br/>EXT. XANDER'S HOUSE -- DAY 
(DAY 2) <br/><br/>The next day. <br/><br/>INT. XANDER'S BASEMENT -- DAY (DAY 2) 
<br/><br/>Xander and Anya look on as SPIKE smokes and packs items into bag: a 
carton of cigarettes, containers of blood, a radio. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>XANDER <br/>You own nothing. This shouldn't <br/>take so long. 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Hang on, let a fellow get <br/>organized. <br/><br/>XANDER 
<br/>That's my radio! <br/></center><br/><br/>Xander grabs the radio out of Spike's 
hands. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE <br/>And you're what? Shocked and <br/>disappointed? I'm evil! 
<br/><br/>ANYA <br/>So, what kind of place are you <br/>looking for? <br/><br/>SPIKE 
<br/>Dunno. Maybe a crypt. Someplace, <br/>you know, dark and dank. But not <br/>as 
dark and dank as this. <br/><br/>ANYA <br/>It's pretty depressing, isn't it? 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>I've known corpses with a fresher <br/>smell. In fact, I've 
been one. <br/></center><br/><br/>Spike flicks his cigarette ash onto the floor. 
Xander points to the ashtray sitting right next to him. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>XANDER <br/>Ashtray. Not getting any... more <br/>like an ashtray. 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Piss off. <br/></center><br/><br/>Spike flicks his cigarette butt 
at Xander. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>XANDER <br/>That's it. Let's go. <br/><br/>ANYA <br/>Wait. I want to give 
you <br/>something for your new place. <br/></center><br/><br/>Anya picks up a lamp, 
hands it to Spike. <br/><br/>
<center><br/>XANDER <br/>That's my lamp! <br/><br/>ANYA <br/>A gift is traditional. I 
read <br/>about it. <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>That's among <i></i>. With bitter 
<br/>enemies, we don't give them my <br/>lamp. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Not gonna have 
electricity anyway. <br/>It's a crypt, remember? <br/></center><br/><br/>Xander 
takes the lamp, puts it back where she got it. <br/><br/><br/>ANYA <br/>
<center>What about running water? A <br/>fridge to keep your blood fresh? 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>No... <br/></center><br/>
<center>ANYA <br/>That's gonna just suck. You <br/>should get a hotel room or 
<br/>something. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>(to Xander) <br/>Demon girl's got a point. Need 
<br/>fresh blood. If I had a few bob <br/>for a room with an honor bar... 
<br/><br/>XANDER <br/>Out! Before I get the Slayer over <br/>here to kick your ass 
out! <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Don't see why she didn't come... <br/>Say goodbye, shed a 
few tears... <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>Well, she has an appointment with <br/>someone 
who's actually still scary. <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. MAGGIE WALSH'S OFFICE -- 
DAY (DAY 2) <br/><br/>CLOSE ON MAGGIE, seated at her desk. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>MAGGIE <br/>So... The Slayer. <br/></center><br/><br/>CUT OUT to Buffy 
seated in a chair across from her, shifting nervously. Riley stands over Buffy's 
shoulder. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Yep. That's me. <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>We thought you were a myth. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>(unsure what to say) <br/>Well... You were myth-taken. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>She laughs weakly at her little attempt to break the ice. 
Riley offers a slightly embarrassed smile. Maggie studies her, stonily. Buffy 
sobers. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>MAGGIE <br/>And to think, all that time you <br/>were sitting in my class- 
well, <br/>most of those times. I always <br/>thought you could have done 
<br/>better than a B-minus, but now I <br/>understand your energies were 
<br/>directed elsewhere. <br/></center><br/><br/>She stands and crosses to a window, 
her back to them. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>MAGGIE (cont'd) <br/>What I <i>don't</i> understand is how <br/>Agent 
Finn... <br/></center><br/><br/>Unseen by Maggie, Buffy stifles a giggle and points 
at Riley, mouthing "Agent Finn." Riley gestures for her to stop. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>MAGGIE (cont'd) <br/>... came to tell you all about <i></i><br/>and our... 
<br/></center><br/><br/>She turns back to face Riley, glaring disapprovingly. Riley 
straightens, his turn to be nervous. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>MAGGIE (cont'd) <br/>...<i>highly secret</i> organization. <br/><br/>RILEY 
<br/>Uh, yes, well... like I said, <br/>ma'am, we were in a combat <br/>situation 
with some... Hostiles... <br/>and she saw me in my... gear <br/>and... well, my 
cover was pretty <br/>well blown... so-- <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>So you figured why 
not tell her <br/>everything. <br/>(before he can answer) <br/>It's all right. 
We're all on the <br/>same team. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>We are? <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>Our 
goals are similar. We're each <br/>interested in curtailing the Sub- 
<br/>terrestrial menace. It's only our <br/>methods that differ. We use the 
<br/>latest in scientific technology <br/>and state-of-the-art weaponry <br/>and 
you -- if I understand this <br/>correctly -- poke them with a <br/>sharp stick. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>It's more effective than it sounds. <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>Oh, I'm 
quite sure of that. As <br/>I'm just as sure we can learn much <br/>from each 
other. I'm working on <br/>getting you clearance to come into <br/>the Initiative. 
I think you'll find <br/>the results of our operation most <br/>impressive. Agent 
Finn here, alone, <br/>has captured or killed... <br/>(to Riley) <br/>How many is 
it? <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Seventeen. Eleven vampires. Six <br/>demons. <br/><br/>BUFFY 
<br/>(trying to be impressed) <br/>Huh. Well, that is... I mean... <br/>Wow. 
Seventeen. <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>What about you? <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Me? 
<br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>How many hostiles would you say <br/>you've... slain? 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy considers, looking at Riley, then back to Maggie. 
Then as she opens her mouth to speak... <br/><br/>INT. GILES' APARTMENT -- DAY ( 
DAY 2) <br/><br/>Giles dusts his bookshelves. He happens to note a heavy, 
old-looking book. He pulls it out, checks something. He checks today's date on 
his desk calendar, counts on his fingers... <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>(working it out) <br/>The third new moon after the nine 
<br/>hundredth Feast of Delthrox. <br/>Oh... crap. <br/></center><br/><br/>TIME CUT 
TO: <br/><br/>INT. GILES' APARTMENT -- MINUTES LATER -- DAY <br/><br/>Giles is on 
the phone as he stuff things into a bag -- candles, rocks with symbols on them, 
exotic-looking knives... <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>No, we can't <i></i>for her, Willow. <br/>The Demon Prince 
Barvain is going <br/>to rise tonight... Well, where is <br/>she exactly? 
<br/></center><br/><br/>EXT. CAMPUS -- DAY <br/><br/>Buffy and Riley walk in the 
sunshine. Riley's remarkably calm, working through his awe. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>Wow. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>But those were my best stories. 
<br/>Didn't tell you the "Buffy breaks <br/>her butt" stories. <br/><br/>RILEY 
<br/>But you killed the... You did the <br/>thing with the... And you drowned, 
<br/>and then... snake! Not to mention <br/>daily slayage of.... 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy watches Riley as he thinks for a beat. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY (cont'd) <br/>Wow. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>No big. Really. Hey, who wants 
<br/>ice cream? <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Buffy, when I saw you stop the <br/>world 
from... you know, ending, <br/>I assumed that was a big week for <br/>you. Turns 
out I suddenly find <br/>myself... needing to know the <br/>plural of apocalypse. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>If you'd been fighting evil since <br/>you were fifteen, you'd 
have a <br/>hefty resume, too. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Fifteen? 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Riley takes this in, dealing. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>I know, 'wow' but, the point is, we <br/>have different amounts 
of experience <br/>Plus, I've got that whole preternatural <br/>slayer strength 
deal... <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>I've seen. Don't get me wrong, <br/>girls I grew up 
with could hold <br/>their own, but... I'm not even <br/>sure <i>I </i>could take 
you. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Well. That kind of depends on <br/>your meaning. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>They smile -- there's a challenge brewing. <br/><br/>EXT. 
HALL OUTSIDE MAGGIE WALSH'S OFFICE -- DAY <br/><br/>Giles knocks at Maggie's 
office door. It reads "Dr. M. Walsh. Psychology." <br/><br/><br/>
<center>MAGGIE (O.S.) <br/>Yes? <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles opens it, enters. 
<br/><br/>INT. MAGGIE WALSH'S OFFICE -- DAY <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Professor Walsh, I presume. <br/>You're hard to find. These 
halls <br/>are quite the labyrinth. I felt <br/>rather like Theseus. With the 
<br/>Minotaur. In the... labyrinth. <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>Can I help you with 
something, <br/>Mr... <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Giles. Rupert. I'm looking for <br/>Buffy 
Summers. I'm... I'm a <br/>friend of hers. <br/></center><br/><br/>Maggie looks at 
him incredulously. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>And... I was her high school <br/>librarian. 
<br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>I'm sorry. Buffy isn't here. But <br/>if I see her... 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>Buffy has been very influenced by <br/>your course. She quotes 
you quite <br/>often. Sometimes she sounds <br/>rather like an introductory 
<br/>textbook herself. <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>I don't lecture from the textbook, 
<br/>but I'm glad she's inspired by the <br/>material. She's a bright girl. All 
<br/>she's really been lacking is <br/>encouragement in the academic <br/>setting. 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>Well, well, I think it's best to <br/>let a young person find 
their <br/>own strengths. If, if you lead a <br/>child by the hand, they never 
<br/>find their own footing. <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>And if it's true about hiking, 
<br/>ergo it must be true about life? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>That's not... I'm simply 
saying <br/>Buffy isn't the typical student. <br/>If you really got to know her, 
<br/>you'd find out she's a very <br/>unique girl. I hope you're not <br/>going to 
push her too-- <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>I think I do know her. And I have <br/>found 
her to be a unique woman. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Woman. Of course. How wrong of 
<br/>me to choose my own word... <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>She's very self-reliant, very 
<br/>independent... <br/><br/>GILES <br/>That's what I-- <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>Which is 
not always a good thing. <br/>It can be unhealthy to take on adult <br/>roles too 
early. I suspect what I'm <br/>seeing is a reaction to the absence of <br/>a male 
role model. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>The absence of a-- <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>Buffy 
clearly lacks a strong <br/>father figure. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>I... I... I... I... 
<br/><br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>I'm sorry. I have things to do <br/>now. I'll tell Buffy 
her friend <br/>was looking for her. <br/></center><br/><br/>She goes back to her 
desk. Giles exits, fuming. <br/><br/>EXT. CEMETERY -- NIGHT (DAY 2) <br/><br/>Giles 
leads Willow and Xander through the cemetery... <br/><br/><br/>
<center>WILLOW <br/>This prince demon guy was supposed <br/>to rise at sunset. So 
aren't we like... <br/>late? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Yes, well, if I hadn't had to 
search <br/>the globe for our Miss Summers <br/>and do battle with that 
harridan... <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>And if you hadn't gotten lost on <br/>campus 
afterwards... <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Never mind. I'll take care of it <br/>myself. 
Vanquished a few demons <br/>without her in my day. Of course, <br/>it shouldn't 
surprise me if we <i></i><br/>entirely too late. Demon on the <br/>loose, carnage 
everywhere-- <br/></center><br/><br/>They enter: <br/><br/>INT. CRYPT -- CONTINUOUS 
-- NIGHT <br/><br/>The place is still and quiet and neat and empty. No carnage. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>XANDER <br/>Your better demons will clean up <br/>after themselves. 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>I... I don't understand. There <br/>should be... ruptured 
earth, <br/>broken stone... <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles sets his bag in the 
shadows near the door. He speaks as he sets out ritual items: a candle, an 
inscribed stone... <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>Apparently, it hasn't happened <br/>yet. A bit of 
luck. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Or, you know what I bet? I bet <br/>the Initiative took 
care of it. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Who? <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>Riley and his guys. 
Probably all <br/>over it. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>It has that "too neat" look. They 
<br/>must've cleaned up. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>What? <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>They read hot 
spots. Areas of <br/>otherwordly energy. I'm sure <br/>they picked up this place 
days ago. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Stop. Both of you. What's the <br/>Initiative and 
what does it have <br/>to do with Buffy's new boyfriend? <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>You 
know... I'm sure you know... <br/>Riley, he's one of the commandos... 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>What? Oh, that's bloody marvelous! <br/>After I've spent weeks 
trying to get <br/>a single scrap of information on our <br/>mysterious 
demon-collectors, no one <br/>bothered to tell me that <i>Buffy is <br/>dating 
one</i>! Who else knows this? <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>No one! No one else knows this. 
<br/>(beat) <br/>Anya. That's it. <br/></center><br/><br/>Beat. <br/><br/><br/>WILLOW 
<br/>
<center>And Spike. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Spike?! <i></i>knew? <br/><br/>XANDER 
<br/>Only the basic stuff. Riley's a <br/>commando. Professor Walsh is in 
<br/>charge-- <br/><br/>GILES <br/><i>Professor Walsh</i>? That... fishwife? 
<br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>She's not so bad once you get to-- <br/>(off Giles' glare) 
<br/>So, the demon's probably a little <br/>late. We'll just, you know... 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>(the energy drained out of him) <br/>Forget it. You two can 
leave. <br/>I'll stay a little longer, just in <br/>case. <br/><br/>WILLOW 
<br/>You're sure? We could stay... <br/><br/>GILES <br/>No. Go. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Willow and Xander exit. Left alone, Giles starts gathering 
up his ritual items. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>Oh, who am I kidding? Nothing's <br/>going to happen. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Giles heads toward the door. After he's gone, ETHAN RAYNE 
steps out of the shadowy corner of the crypt. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN <br/>(ominous) <br/>I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't <br/>say that at 
all. In fact, Old <br/>Ripper, I'd say something rather <br/>interesting was about 
to-- <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles, having simply retrieved his bag from near the 
door, steps back into the light. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>What did you s-- <br/></center><br/><br/>Ethan jumps, startled

<center>ETHAN <br/>Watch it! Now hang on. You want <br/>to knock the crap out of 
me, go <br/>ahead. I can't stop you. Or, you <br/>could listen to me and find out 
<br/>what's going on. <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles hesitates, hand already drawn 
back... <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>What are you on about? <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>Something bad is 
happening. Bad <br/>for both of us. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Well, bad for you, yeah. 
<br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>No, no. You have to listen. <br/>You're going to need time to 
<br/>Prepare. <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. BAR -- NIGHT (DAY 2) <br/><br/>Giles and 
Ethan, in a booth. A WAITRESS puts pints in front of them and moves off. She's 
attractive in a faded-rose kind of way. <br/><br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>
<center>Brilliant. Now, isn't this more <br/>fun than kicking my arse? 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>No. <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>Oh. Well it's more fun for me. 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>Just tell me what you want to tell <br/>me. <br/><br/>ETHAN 
<br/>Tch. So cross. We used to be <br/>friends, Ripper. When'd that all <br/>fall 
apart? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>I believe it was right about when <br/>you started 
worshipping chaos. <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>Ahh. Religious intolerance. Sad, <br/>that. 
I mean, look at the Irish <br/>troubles-- <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles starts to 
leave. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Right. That's it. <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>Hold up! I'll tell you. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Reluctantly , Giles sits back down. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN (cont'd) <br/>Something's happening in the dark <br/>worlds. It's 
all rumors and whispers <br/>out there, mate. Only thing coming <br/>through clear 
is that something <br/>is harming demons and it's not <br/>the Slayer. You know 
anything <br/>about it? <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles ducks the question. 
<br/><br/><br/>GILES <br/>
<center>What are they saying? <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>Oh, you know demons, it's all 
<br/>exaggeration and blank verse. <br/>"Pain as bright as steel," that <br/>kind 
of thing. They're scared. <br/>And there's something called three- <br/>fourteen's 
got 'em scared most of <br/>all. The kind of scared that turns <br/>to angry. 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>Three-fourteen. What's that? <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>No bloody idea. 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>You're not being very helpful for <br/>a man trying not to get 
beaten-up. <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>But I am. I'm giving you a <br/>valuable warning. 
What ever's <br/>doing this, it's not respecting <br/>the old ways. I don't 
pretend to <br/>like you, Rupert, but we're a <br/>couple of old mystics, we are. 
We <br/>know what we're dealing with. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Right. That's why we 
never get <br/>into trouble. <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>This new outfit, it's blundering 
<br/>into a place it doesn't belong. <br/>It's throwing the worlds out of 
<br/>balance and that's beyond chaos, <br/>mate. We're headed, quite literally, 
<br/>for one hell of a fight. <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. GYM -- NIGHT (DAY 2) 
<br/><br/>BAM! Buffy delivers a well-placed fist to Riley's head, but he blocks 
it. Responds with a slow-speed punch that Buffy easily ducks. <br/>They get more 
serious and things move faster. He catches her around the neck with his arm, 
tries to pull her into a headlock. She spins out of it, knocking his legs from 
under him. He hits the ground rolling, comes up into a wrestler's stance. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>Are you holding back? <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Are you? <br/><br/>RILEY 
<br/>Maybe. A little. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Maybe me too. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>I'll go 
all out if you will. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>You sure? <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Here we go. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Riley pushes her back, out of his grasp. They go at each 
other, it's fast and sexy, but Buffy has mostly been blocking. Now she does one 
simple kick. It catches Riley in the chest and BLOWS HIM BACK TEN FEET. He hits 
the wall, collapses to the floor. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Riley! <br/></center><br/><br/>She runs to him, helps him up. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Are you hurt? <br/></center><br/><br/>He's checking for 
broken ribs. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>I... I'm... I don't think so. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>I didn't--I'm 
so sorry. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>It's fine. I'm good. <br/></center><br/><br/>He smiles 
at her, impressed with her. And Buffy smiles back, wonders; is he gonna be okay 
with this? <br/><br/>ITN. BAR -- LATER (NIGHT) <br/><br/>Giles and Ethan are drunk. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>You know what gets me? Here's <br/>what gets me. I fight demons 
for <br/>twenty years. Maggie Walsh comes <br/>in, six months later -- demons 
<br/>pissing themselves with fear. <br/>They never even noticed me? <br/><br/>ETHAN 
<br/>They're pretty busy. Who's Maggie <br/>Walsh? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Oh, she's 
awful. Said I was an <br/>absent male role model. Absent, <br/>my ass. And I'm 
<i></i>the man <br/>she is. <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>I don't doubt it. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>The waitress sets down full mugs, collects their empties. 
Ethan scribbles something on his napkin, hands it to her. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN (cont'd) <br/>Here, luv. M' name and number. <br/>Ring me up. I'll 
show you a time. <br/><br/>WAITRESS <br/>(off napkin) <br/>You're not Roger Moore. 
<br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>God's truth. Tell her, Ripper. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>What? Oh. 
He's not Roger Moore. <br/></center><br/><br/>The waitress walks away. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN <br/>Thanks. That was helpful. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>We've gotta face 
it. We've <br/>changed. Well, you're still <br/>self-centered and sadistic. 
<br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>(raising mug) <br/>Here's to me! <br/></center><br/><br/>They 
clink and drink. Giles continues. <br/><br/><br/>GILES <br/>
<center>But the world's passed us both by . <br/>someone snuck in and took us 
away <br/>and left these old men in our place. <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>I tried to get 
Head of Slug the <br/>other day, for a spell. Know what <br/>they told me? They 
only had <br/>synthetic. Synthetic Slug-Head? <br/>What's that? <br/><br/>GILES 
<br/>We're relics, mate. Dusty scraps <br/>of a world that doesn't exist 
<br/>anymore. I mean, the bleeding <br/>"Initiative"--their methods may <br/>cause 
problems, but they're <br/>getting it done. What am I? An <br/>unemployed 
librarian with a <br/>tendency to get knocked on the <br/>head and a drawer full 
of grotty <br/>amulets. 'S pathetic. <br/></center><br/><br/>Ethan suddenly appears 
stone sober. In a clear, dark voice: <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN <br/>(ominous) <br/>You don't' have to worry about all <br/>that 
anymore, mate. When you went <br/>to the loo I slipped a small pellet <br/>of 
poison in your drink. You'll be <br/>dead in an hour. <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles 
stares at Ethan. A beat. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN (cont'd) <br/>Just kidding. <br/></center><br/><br/>Ethan laughs. 
Giles blinks, then laughs along with Ethan. They drink. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>I'm gonna feel like hell in the <br/>morning. <br/><br/>ETHAN 
<br/>(ominous) <br/>Yes, you will. <br/>(then, drunk again) <br/>Kidding. Relax. 
Stop thinking so <br/>much and enjoy the night. We're <br/>sorcerers. The night is 
still our <br/>time. The time of magic. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>To magic! 
<br/></center><br/><br/>They drink. <br/><br/>INT. TARA'S ROOM -- NIGHT (DAY 2) 
<br/><br/>Tara is making a symbol on the floor with salt and black sand. Willow 
puts a single rose in the center of the symbol. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>WILLOW <br/>I'm glad you wanted to get <br/>together. I know it's late. 
<br/><br/>TARA <br/>I... Thanks. I was happy you <br/>Called. <br/><br/>WILLOW 
<br/>We'll start out slow. <br/><br/>TARA <br/>Okay. <br/></center><br/><br/>They sit 
down facing each other. They join hands over the rose. They close their eyes. 
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<center>TARA (cont'd) <br/>Willow? <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Yeah? <br/><br/>TARA 
<br/>Start out slow doing what? <br/></center><br/><br/>They open their eyes. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>WILLOW <br/>Oh. We're going to float the <br/>rose. Then we're going to 
use the <br/>majicks to pluck the petals off one <br/>at a time. It's a test of 
synchronicity. <br/>Our minds will have to be perfectly <br/>attuned to work as a 
single delicate <br/>implement. <br/><br/>TARA <br/>Cool. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>And it 
should be very pretty. <br/></center><br/><br/>They close their eyes. They 
concentrate. Their hair blows in a swirling breeze. The symbol on the floor 
GLOWS, the rose QUIVERS, and then LIFTS. Willow and Tara open their eyes to see 
it floating above their heads. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>TARA <br/>It worked. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Now the hard part... the 
petals... <br/></center><br/><br/>Suddenly the rose TAKES OFF... ZINGING around the 
room, bouncing off the walls and ceiling, petals flying off. The girls jump to 
their feet, and they have to duck it a couple times. Zing, zing... Finally it 
lands at Willow's feet. A battered, SMOKING, rose stem. Puzzled, she picks it 
up. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd) <br/>What the heck was that? <br/><br/>TARA <br/>I don't 
know. But... <br/>(bright side) <br/>the petals are off. <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. 
GILES' BEDROOM -- MORNING (DAY 3) <br/><br/>Outside the window, the morning sun 
shines bright, and sweet little birdies twitter. Inside, Giles is a miserable 
lump under the sheets. He GROANS. He starts to turn under the sheet, throwing it 
off him, filling the frame with white. <br/><br/>From WHITE to BLACK <br/><br/>INT. 
GILES' LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER <br/><br/>The black recedes ahead of camera... 
it is Giles' pajama bottoms. He trudges down the stairway toward a MIRROR 
mounted there. He looks blearily at himself in the mirror. Double take. He's an 
almost unrecognizable, horned, tufted eared, spiny-torsoed guy in silk pajama 
bottoms. <i>He's a demon.</i> He squints at himself. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>No. <br/></center><br/><br/>He leans in closer, resting a hand 
next to the mirror, and accidentally punches a hole into the wall. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>Oh. <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles hurries down the last 
few steps into the living room. The last few feet of banister snap off in his 
hand. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>Damn. <br/></center><br/><br/>He tosses the wood aside 
impatiently -- it knocks over a chair, breaking it. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>Ethan. You bloody rotten tosser. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Giles picks up the phone and accidentally crushes the 
receiver in his hand. He gives up and heads for the door instead. On the way he 
spots last night's shirt on the floor. He picks it up and tries to put it on. It 
tears on his spiny ridges. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>And I liked that shirt. <br/></center><br/><br/>He drips 
the shirt and grabs the blanket off the back of the sofa and heads out the door. 
He slams it behind him. It splinters. <br/><br/><br/>GILES (O.S.) <br/>Damn! 
<br/><br/><br/>INT. ROCKET CAFÉ -- MORNING (DAY 3) <br/><br/>Buffy and Willow talk 
over breakfast. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>I like pancakes. They're <br/>stackable. And waffles 'cause you 
<br/>could put stuff in the little holes if <br/>you wanted to. <br/><br/>WILLOW 
<br/>You should always have a new <br/>boyfriend. You're so fun right now. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy smiles, embarrassed. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Hey, I didn't even hear you come <br/>in last night. Where were 
you? <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Oh, chem lab, by myself. I was <br/>trying to do a spell. 
Floating a <br/>rose, when all of a sudden, <br/>(gesturing with fork) <br/>Zing! 
Zing! All over the room, <br/>like a... rose-based missile. <br/><br/>BUFFY 
<br/>Yikes. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>I know. I think there's something <br/>out there. I 
felt like, there was <br/>this presence, this dark-majiks <br/>energy blocking the 
spell. It's new. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Someone else doing majiks? <br/><br/>WILLOW 
<br/>Maybe. If so, it's someone pretty <br/>powerful. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Huh. I'll 
tell Giles about it. <br/>Oh, or maybe Maggie, she seems <br/>interested in this 
kind of stuff, <br/>learning the mystical side of the <br/>demon-hunting biz. 
<br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Talk to Giles. He's feeling a <br/>little hurt right now. How 
come <br/>you never told him about Riley <br/>being a commando? <br/><br/>BUFFY 
<br/>I did. I didn't? <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>He says no. He's feeling all 
<br/>neglected and out of the loopy. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Huh. I mean, at first I 
didn't <br/>tell, 'cause Riley said not to. <br/>Then it was -- meow- cat out of 
<br/>bag, and I forgot he didn't know. <br/>I'll make it right next time I see 
<br/>him. Tomorrow. I'm spending <br/>today with Riley. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Of 
course. I forgot that's what <br/>you always do on days when the <br/>Earth 
rotates. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Well, it's just going so great. <br/>I think. I hope. 
Last night I <br/>kicked him across the room. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Um... that's not 
good. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>We were sparring. He told me not <br/>to hold back. He's 
a little dented <br/>but I think he's okay with it. He <br/>said he was okay with 
it. You <br/>think he's okay with it? <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>I'm sure he is. And even 
if he <br/>isn't, you had to do it. I mean, <br/>he's right, you can't go around 
<br/>pretending you're less than you <br/>are. It wouldn't be right for you <br/>to 
hold back. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Right... <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>What? <br/><br/>BUFFY 
<br/>I held back a little. <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. XANDER'S BASEMENT -- DAY 
(DAY 3) <br/><br/>Giles, looking very spiny and horrible, lets himself in through 
the outside door. He looks around. Xander is asleep on the sofa bed. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>(to himself) <br/>Asleep. It's ten-thirty in the <br/>morning. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Giles shakes Xander by the shoulder. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>Xander? Xander, wake up. <br/></center><br/><br/>Xander 
starts to wake up, rolls to face Giles, eyes closed. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>XANDER <br/>(asleep) <br/>Mom? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>No, not Mom. Now you're 
going to <br/>look at me, and you might be a <br/>little... alarmed. But there's 
no need. <br/>It's me, Giles. Ethan has turned me into <br/>a demon and I need 
your help. <br/></center><br/><br/>Xander opens his eyes, looks right at Giles, 
freezes. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>Hello. Yes, it's me. <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>Yaaaa! 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Xander scrambles backwards -- up and over the back of the 
sofa. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Listen. Can't you understand me? <br/></center><br/><br/>XANDER'S 
POV: <br/><br/>Giles is saying: <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Rrr. Grrbch fffahar lagggh! <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>Demon! Demon! 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Xander looks around wildly for a weapon. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Xander, calm down! You're just-- <br/></center><br/><br/>XANDER'S 
POV: <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>--Grbr aachjk blah! <br/></center><br/><br/>Xander grabs a 
saucepan (from the shelves near the sofa). He HURLS it at Giles, grabs another. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>Hey! Ow! <br/></center><br/><br/>XANDER'S POV: 
<br/><br/>Giles roars unintelligibly, flails at the pots and pans, knocks them 
aside and breaks things. Finally Giles exits in a hurry. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>XANDER <br/>That's right, run for your life! <br/></center><br/><br/>EXT. 
SUBURBIA -- DAY <br/><br/>Xander's neighborhood. Giles runs through the yards. A 
MAN with a leaf blower stops and stares, then backs up in fear. A WOMAN carrying 
groceries from her car sees him and drops the groceries. A SMALL CHILD screams 
until its MOTHER scoops it up and runs away. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>MOTHER <br/>Call 9-1-1! <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Bloody humans... 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Giles runs for his life. <br/><br/>BLACK OUT. <br/><br/><br/>END

3) <br/><br/>Buffy, Willow, Xander and Anya walk into the courtyard. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>It had pointy things? What kind <br/>of pointy things? 
<br/><br/>XANDER <br/>The pointy kind. And tufty ears. <br/>Oh, and it might have a 
sauce-pan- <br/>shaped bruise. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Giles'll know what it was. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy has spotted Giles' splintered front door. Suddenly 
serious, she walks ahead, pushing open the broken door. <br/><br/>INT. GILES' 
APARTMENT -- NIGHT <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>(calling) <br/>Giles? <br/></center><br/><br/>Xander runs upstairs 
while the girls look downstairs, noting the broken items. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Xander isn't the only one who got <br/>a visit today. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Xander returns down the stairs. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>XANDER <br/>He's not upstairs. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Oh God, Giles... 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Okay. There was a demon and Giles <br/>is gone. But it doesn't 
mean that <br/>Giles is hurt. There's no blood. <br/>It might've just taken him 
<br/>somewhere... <br/></center><br/><br/>Anya picks up Giles' torn shirt. She holds 
it up. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ANYA <br/>I think it ate him up. <br/></center><br/><br/>EXT. CEMETERY -- 
NIGHT (DAY 3) <br/><br/>Giles wanders through the cemetery, rubbing his demony 
head and grumbling to himself. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>What kind of people let their <br/>children throw stones .}{ 
<br/></center><br/><br/>He rounds a corner and finds himself next to Spike. Spike 
holds up a measuring tape to the side of a crypt, looking at it appraisingly. He 
turns, sees Giles, smiles evilly. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE <br/>Well, what do I spy with my little <br/>eye? A demon. That 
would be... <br/>oh right... the things I can kill. <br/></center><br/><br/>Spike 
saunters over, circles Giles predatorily. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Spike. Wonderful. The perfect <br/>end to a perfect day. 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>(incredulous) <br/>Giles? <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles is flexing 
his muscle-y, demony arms. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Fine, let's get on with the <br/>fighting--You understand me? 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Of course I understand you. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>I'm speaking 
English? <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>No. You're speaking Fyarl. I <br/>happen to speak 
Fyarl. And, by <br/>the way, why the hell are you <br/>suddenly a Fyarl demon? 
'Cause <br/>I like to think I'm pretty observant, <br/>and I never saw a sign of 
it, I swear. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>It's a funny story. If funny <br/>meant horrific. 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>What, you just come over all <br/>demony this morning? 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>Matter of fact, I did. Thanks to <br/>Ethan Rayne. You've got 
to help <br/>me find him. He has to undo this. <br/>Then he needs a good 
being-killed. <br/></center><br/><br/>Spike leans against the mausoleum, lights a 
cigarette. <br/><br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>And I'm supposed to just help you <br/>out of 
the evilness of my heart? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>You, you help me and I don't, 
<br/>don't kill you. <br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE <br/>Oh, tremendously convincing. Try <br/>it again without the 
stutter. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Money. I can pay you money. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Spike stands up straight, tosses the cigarette aside. 
<br/><br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>
<center>Ooh. I like money. How much? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>A hundred dollars. 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>A hundred dollars? You'll have to <br/>to <i>a lot better 
</i>than that. <br/>(then) <br/>Two hundred. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Fine. <br/><br/>SPIKE 
<br/>Right then. What's first? I run tell <br/>the Slayer what you've gotten 
<br/>yourself into? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>No! Don't do that. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Ah... 
embarrassed. One of my <br/>favorite human weaknesses, makes <br/>the blood go to 
the skin. Little <br/>Willow does it 'specially well. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>I'm not 
embarrassed. It's just <br/>not... not necessary. When I find <br/>Ethan, I can 
clear this up without <br/>Buffy having to know that anything <br/>happened to me 
at all. <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. GILES' APARTMENT -- NIGHT (DAY 3) 
<br/><br/>Buffy, Willow and Anya are pulling books off Giles' shelf, shoving 
pictures of various demons in front of Xander. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>XANDER <br/>No... no... okay, that's a giant <br/>vulture. I'd have 
mentioned if it <br/>was a giant vulture. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Buffy, even if we 
figure out what <br/>kind of demon got Giles, how are <br/>we going to find it? 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>We'll figure it out. <br/>(to Xander) <br/>This one has tufty 
ears. <br/></center><br/><br/>They all stop when they hear someone RATTLING THE 
BROKEN DOOR. Buffy is instantly alert. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>WILLOW <br/>What was that? <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>Someone's coming in. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy pulls a stake, moves to the die of the door. It 
opens, and she finds herself about to stake... Riley. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>Buffy? <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Riley? What are you going here? 
<br/></center><br/><br/>She puts away the stake. He looks around curiously. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>There were 9-1-1 calls. From a couple <br/>different places. 
Including here. <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>You get 9-1-1 calls? <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>We 
have a tap into the system. It <br/>flags things with possible non- <br/>human 
causes. We check 'em out. <br/>What are you doing here? <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>This is 
Giles' apartment. He's <br/>missing. The calls... did anyone <br/>see what did it? 
<br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Negativ--no. Neighbors just <br/>heard, you know, growling, 
things <br/>breaking. Sounded like a struggle. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Poor Giles. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>We'll get him back. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>What are you working on? 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>We have... stuff. Pictures... <br/><br/>ANYA <br/>We have 
nothing. <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy looks down, trying to hide her fears. Riley 
takes Buffy the shoulders, looks into her eyes. As if he's trying to transfer 
his hope to her. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>I'll help. The whole Initiative. <br/>We'll do whatever you 
need. <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy is moved by the offer, the complete trust it 
represents. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Thanks. I just wish I knew what <br/>I needed. I keep thinking, 
let's <br/>ask Giles, and then I remember. <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>He'd be great right 
now. He'd <br/>find himself in a second. <br/>Nobody's cooler in a crisis. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>INT./EXT. GILES' CAR ON STREET -- NIGHT (DAY 3) 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>If you can't <i></i>third gear, <br/>don't <i></i>for third 
gear! <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles is shouting at Spike, who drives the Citroen. 
Giles is bundled under a blanket in the passenger seat. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE <br/>Doing my best. Don't know if I'm <br/>driving this thing or 
wearing it. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>It's perfectly serviceable. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Spike laughs. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE <br/>Funny. Hearing a Fyarl demon say <br/>"serviceable." Had a 
couple of 'em <br/>working for me once. They're more <br/>like "Like to crush. 
Crush now?" <br/>Strong, though. You won't meet <br/>a jar you can't open for the 
rest <br/>of your life. <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles growls. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>What was that? Did you growl? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>No. 
Listen, about Fyarl demons... <br/>do I, do I have any special powers? 
<br/>Setting things on fire with my <br/>sizzling eye beams? <br/><br/>SPIKE 
<br/>Well, you got the mucus thing... <br/><br/>Giles <br/>What? Mucus? 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Paralyzing mucus: shoots out the <br/>nose, sets up fast. Hard 
as a <br/>rock. Pretty good in a fight. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>You're making this up. 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Maybe. But, hey, you feel a sneeze <br/>coming on, you warn me. 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>Turn here. <br/></center><br/><br/>Spike turns the car. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>(alarmed) <br/>Downshift! Downshift! <br/><br/>SPIKE 
<br/>Calm down, will you? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>I'm not sure I can. I... I think 
<br/>I'm changing. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Fine with me, long's you still <br/>pay me. 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>I don't like this feeling. It's like <br/>a... a mindless need 
to destroy <br/>things. Anger. Rage. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>(wistful) <br/>Good times. 
Go with it. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>(calm) <br/>No. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>It's fun! I can't 
do it. Do it for <br/>me. Let yourself go! <br/><br/>GILES <br/>(extremely rational) 
<br/>I refuse to become a monster, just <br/>because I look like one. I have a 
<br/>soul. I have a conscience. I am a <br/>human being. <br/>(sees something, very 
calm) <br/>Ooh. Stop the car. <br/></center><br/><br/>Spike stops the car. They're 
on the street near the Sun Cinema. Maggie walks along the sidewalk. Giles hops 
out and runs at Maggie, waving his arms, ROARING like a demon maniac. Maggie 
screams and runs away. Giles gets back in the car, pleased with himself. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>(calm) <br/>Right. Let's go then. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>INT. GILES' APARTMENT -- NIGHT (DAY 3) <br/><br/>Xander looks 
at an etching of a Fyarl demon. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>XANDER <br/><i>That's </i>the thing that attacked me. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>The others close in to look at the picture as Willow reads 
all about it, paraphrasing. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>WILLOW <br/>A Fyarl demon. Sort of a foot- <br/>soldier type. Works for 
other <br/>demons lots of the time. Very <br/>strong, and... oh, hey: Mucus. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Mucus? <br/></center><br/><br/>Riley's cell phone rings or 
squawks or something. He answers it (it's a cell-phone with a walkie-talkie 
feature -- we only hear his half of a conversation): <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>Agent Finn... go ahead. <br/></center><br/><br/>As he listens... 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>(to Willow) <br/>How do I kill it? <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Silver. A 
weapon made of silver. <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>Did you just say "mucus"? 
<br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>You don't want to know. <br/></center><br/><br/>Riley is still 
listening... <br/><br/><br/>RILEY <br/>
<center>When...? Yes... <br/>(with an uncomfortable look <br/>toward Buffy) <br/>I 
understand. <br/></center><br/><br/>He terminates the connection. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY (cont'd) <br/>The demon attacked Professor <br/>Walsh. It got out of 
a small gray <br/>car. A Citroen. <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>It stole Giles' car! 
<br/><br/>XANDER <br/>Why would a demon steal a car? <br/><br/>ANYA <br/>Why would a 
demon steal <i></i>car? <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy suddenly becomes General 
Buffy. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>A demon that steals a car has a <br/>reason. It has a purpose. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>They all look at her... they see the change in her. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>But it sounds like Fyarl demons aren't <br/>really big 
independent thinkers. Willow-- <br/>the spells that have been going wrong. 
<br/>Could that be caused by someone using <br/>majiks to control a demon? Making 
<br/>this Fyarl demon attack Giles? <br/><br/>WILLOW <br/>Yeah. Yes, that would draw 
a lot <br/>of dark energy. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Willow, Xander, stay here. Whoever's 
<br/>controlling the demon may call, ask <br/>for ransom. Give 'em anything they 
<br/>want. <br/><br/>XANDER <br/>You got it. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Riley, come with me 
to the majiks <br/>shop. Maybe they needed supplies. <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy 
makes a detour on her way to the door... looks at Giles' desk. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Something silver... <br/></center><br/><br/>She grabs a 
silver letter opener from Giles' desk. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>A letter opener? That's not very <br/>sharp. <br/><br/>BUFFY 
<br/>Then I'll have to put some muscle <br/>behind it. <br/></center><br/><br/>She 
exits. Riley follows her. <br/><br/>INT. BAR- NIGHT (DAY 3) <br/><br/>Spike tosses 
back a shot and chats up the waitress from last night. Giles sits in the shadows 
at the end of the bar, hiding under his blanket. <br/><br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>
<center>Two of 'em. English like me, but <br/>older, less attractive. One of them 
<br/>gave you his number... <br/><br/>WAITRESS <br/>Oh God, Roger Moore. 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>No. Not Roger Moore-- <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles waves to get 
Spike's attention, then nods vigorously. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>(affirmatively) <br/>Ahrooog. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>(to waitress) 
<br/>Don't mind my friend. He's... <br/>insane. You got Roger's number? 
<br/><br/>WAITRESS <br/>Sorry. <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles sags in defeat. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>WAITRESS (cont'd) <br/>I mean, I took one look, saw he was <br/>staying at 
that rat trap. No thanks. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Which rat trap? <br/><br/>WAITRESS 
<br/>The one by the highway. The <br/>Sunnydale Motor Inn. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Thank 
you. You're a discerning <br/>woman. You ever been in a real <br/>crypt, darling? 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Giles pulls Spike with him as he heads out the door. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>(called back) <br/>I'll be back later. Buy you a 
<br/>drink. I'll have money! <br/></center><br/><br/>They're out the door. Giles 
slams it. It breaks. <br/><br/>INT. MAJIK SHOP -- NIGHT (DAY 3) <br/><br/>CRASH. The 
locked door is kicked in from the outside. Buffy enters, Riley follows. Buffy 
goes to the counter, rummages underneath, breaks open a drawer. Pulls out... 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Credit card slips, copies of <br/>receipts. Help me look. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>They sit on the floor, sort through them. As they look: 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>You shouldn't '}{ have done that to <br/>the door. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Don't have time to play by the <br/>rules tonight. 
<br/><br/>RILEY <br/>I have a master key. Opens every <br/>shop on main street. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Oh. Next time. Absolutely. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>(off receipts) 
<br/>I don't know what I'm looking for. <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy freezes, a 
credit card slip in her hand. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>I do. <br/>(holds it up) <br/>Ethan Rayne. <br/><br/>RILEY 
<br/>Who's that. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Professional bad guy. He's gotta <br/>be the 
one who made the demon <br/>go after Giles. At least we know <br/>who we're 
looking for. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>(into cell phone) <br/>Come in... Are you there? 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>What are you doing? <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>(into phone) <br/>This is 
Agent Finn. I need a search. <br/>Local hotel registrations matching <br/>the name 
Ethan Rayne. R-A-Y-N-E. <br/>I'll wait. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>You can do that? 
<br/><br/>RILEY <br/>It'll take a couple minutes. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Let's get in 
your car. Be ready to go. <br/></center><br/><br/>She starts to get up... 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>Buffy... earlier, when I talked to <br/>Professor Walsh? She 
gave me very <br/>specific orders. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Yeah? <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>She 
said, when we located the <br/>demon... I... I'm not supposed to <br/>bring you 
along. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Oh. <br/></center><br/><br/>She starts to head for the 
door. He follows. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>What are you doing? <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>I'm going to the car. 
And then <br/>we're going where the demon is. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Buffy-- 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>You're not taking me along. I'm <br/>going and I'm letting you 
come with <br/>me. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Buffy, it's not really your call. This 
<br/>is a military operation now. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>So get the troops to stop me, 
'cause <br/>nothing less than that's gonna do it. <br/>This demon did something to 
Giles. <br/>And I'm gonna kill it. <br/></center><br/><br/>She exits. He follows.

NIGHT (DAY 3) <br/><br/>Spike drives again, Giles in the passenger seat (no 
blanket). Giles GROWLS low in his throat. <br/><br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>
<center>How're you feeling, mate? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Like snapping necks until 
<br/>everyone's dead. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Now <i></i>sounds like a Fyarl <br/>demon. 
Good for you. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Spike? If I change all the way, find <br/>Ethan 
anyway, okay? Make him undo <br/>it. Please. Promise me. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Yeah, 
okay. Oh, wait. I mean no. <br/>Doesn't anyone get I'm still evil? <br/>(off 
rear-view mirror) <br/>Hey, picked up a tail. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Just a little 
one. Hurts to sit. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>I mean someone's following us. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Giles twists around, looks behind them. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Humvee. Military. <br/></center><br/><br/>The reflected 
light of the Humvee's headlights is in Spike's eyes now. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Lose them. Speed up. <br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>I've got it floored. 
Why'd you <br/>buy this car? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Do something! If they catch us, 
<br/>we both go into the lab. <br/></center><br/><br/>THE CAR <br/><br/>As it takes a 
turn almost skidding out of control, the Humvee right behind it. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE <br/>It's getting closer... <br/></center><br/><br/>Another Humvee 
cuts in behind them at a side street. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>And it's got a friend. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Damn! 
<br/></center><br/><br/>In frustration, Giles puts his strong demony hand through 
the passenger side window -- glass shatters. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE <br/>Sure, dismantle the getaway car. <br/>That'll scare 'em. 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>Slow down. I'll jump out. They'll <br/>follow you. 
<br/><br/>SPIKE <br/>Wait, these Commandos, they're the <br/>same guys that're after 
me too. <br/>Maybe I want you around to split <br/>their attention a bit. 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>I'll give you another hundred dollars. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>THE CAR <br/><br/>As it takes a turn, slowing marginally. The 
passenger door opens. <i>Impressively macho, Giles jumps from the moving car... 
hits the pavement... rolls!</i> The car speeds off, Humvees right behind it. 
<br/><br/>INT. ETHAN'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT <br/><br/>Cheap motel room. Two double 
beds, a dresser, a TV, not much else. Ethan is stuffing clothes into a 
hard-sided suitcase on one of those folding suitcase stands when Giles bursts 
into the room. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN <br/>Gaaah! Giles? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>(cold menace) <br/>Found you. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Ethan backs up as if from a wild dog. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN <br/>Calm down. It's okay. Good Giles. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>It's okay? 
Oh, I'm gonna rip off <br/>your arms and stuff 'em right up <br/>your-- 
<br/></center><br/><br/>ETHAN'S POV OF GILES <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>Vvrrooh, rrrraatha, hrrrrr! 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Ethan backs up more, hits the wall, cringes. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN <br/>I don't actually speak Fyarl... <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles 
lunges at Ethan, who responds in typical manly fashion by ducking and running, 
zipping around the edge of the room, climbing over the bed, the dresser, the 
other bed... <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN <br/>Don't kill me! I can't undo you <br/>if you kill me! 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Giles ROARS, grabs Ethan by the shirtfront, tosses him 
across the room. Ethan scrambles to his feet, some distance away from Giles. 
Giles raises a hand, pressing one nostril closed threateningly: <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>I'll use my mucus! <br/></center><br/><br/>Ethan understands the 
gesture. He flinches. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN <br/>No! <br/></center><br/><br/>That's where they are when BUFFY AND 
RILEY BURST IN. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN (cont'd) <br/>Slayer! Kill it! It killed Ripper <br/>and now it's 
trying to get me! <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>(to Riley, re: Ethan) <br/>Don't let him go. 
I'll deal with <br/>him after I kill his little pet. <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy 
lunges at Giles, deals him a flying kick that throws him back and makes him 
ROAR. <br/><br/>Ethan tries to sneak out. Riley blocks him. Ethan punches, Riley 
counters efficiently, keeps him from leaving. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN <br/>She's just gonna make him angry... <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy 
and Giles fight. Giles SHOUTS in un-translated Fyarl. Buff hits him with a 
punch. He deals her one in return that throws her against a wall. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Obsolete, am I? Trying to get rid <br/>of me! Good! <i>Try!</i>
<br/></center><br/><br/>Finally, Buffy knocks him down. She looks at him, fire in 
her eyes. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>What did you do to him? <i>What did <br/>you do? 
</i><br/></center><br/><br/>A devastating kick punctuates the question. 
<br/><br/>EXT. STREET -- LOADING DOCK/INT. GILES' CAR -- NIGHT <br/><br/>Spike is 
having a great time in the car chase, grinning and taking the corners wildly. 
<br/><br/>THE CAR <br/><br/>Turns into an alley. We see one of the Humvees miss the 
turn. <br/><br/>IN THE CAR <br/><br/>Spike leans out and yells back. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE <br/>You just try and catch me, filthy <br/>commando-pigs! You just 
try-- <br/></center><br/><br/>He turns to face front again in time to see that the 
alley is being blocked by a truck backing away from a loading dock directly into 
his path. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Oh, blast. <br/></center><br/><br/>He spins the wheel 
wildly, turns, misses the truck by inches! <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Ha! Knew I could do it. Not <br/>gonna stop me-- 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Then HE CRASHES THE CAR INTO THE LOADING DOCK. Pallets of 
produce fly. <br/><br/>After a beat he crawls out of the totaled Citroen, pushing 
the wreckage of the pallets away. Spike takes off running. As he goes: 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>I can kill demons! <i></i>I can <br/>crash cars! 
<br/></center><br/><br/>He runs off into the night. As he goes: <br/><br/><br/>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd) <br/>Things are looking up. <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. 
ETHAN'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT <br/><br/>Giles gets off the floor. But Buffy FLIPS 
over the folding suitcase stand, picking it up as she goes and CLAMPING it down 
on Giles' head. She TWISTS it... <br/><br/>He ROARS and SWATS at her, knocking her 
to one side. <br/><br/>RILEY AND ETHAN: <br/><br/>Riley, still blocking Ethan, is 
distracted by the Buffy/Giles fight. He glances over, and Ethan LUNGES. Ethan 
swings at Riley, who blocks with his forearm and throws a brutal punch at 
Ethan... <br/><br/>Giles shouts in Fyarl as he kicks at Buffy's limp body, rolling 
her over onto her back. He throws his head back in a ROAR of triumph. 
<br/><br/>Buffy's eyes snap open. She braces her arms on the floor and KICKS 
straight up with both legs... catching GILES in the head and knocking him to the 
ground. She FLIPS to her feet and launches herself on him... pummels him with 
punches. She kneels on his chest. She pulls her silver letter opener from her 
jacket and presses the tip against his throat. She braces both hands on it, 
ready to drive it through his neck. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>This is for Giles. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>(confused) <br/>For me? 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy PLUNGES THE LETTER OPENER INTO GILES' CHEST. 
<br/><br/>At the same time, now face to face, she sees... <br/><br/>GILES' EYES 
wide, frozen (is he dead?) Buffy suddenly recognizes him. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Oh my God. Giles. <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles, still alive, 
nods enthusiastically. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>GILES <br/>Ahrooog! Ahrooog! <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Oh God! 
<br/></center><br/><br/>She pulls the letter opener out. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Giles! Giles! I'm sorry! Don't die! <br/><br/>GILES 
<br/>Actually I feel quite well. <br/>Except for the rage. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>I 
think he's okay. <br/>(looking at letter opener) <br/>Is this real silver? 
<br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>Prob'ly pewter. Sometimes Giles <br/>is cheap about that stuff. 
Who's <br/>for a reversal spell? <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. ETHAN'S MOTEL ROOM -- 
LATER (NIGHT) <br/><br/>Riley stands in the open doorway, talking quietly into his 
walkie-talkie. Buffy stands over Ethan, her hand wrapped around the back of his 
collar. He sits on the floor in front of a symbol and some herbs. Giles is 
wearing one of Ethan's shirts, looking at his face in the mirror to make sure 
he's all better. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN <br/>I've got to learn to just do the <br/>damage and leave town. 
It's the <br/>stay-'n-gloat gets me very time. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>(crossing to 
Giles) <br/>Giles? You okay? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Embarrassed mostly. Buffy, I don't 
<br/>know what to say. You know I'd <br/>never intentionally-- <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>I 
know. And I'm so sorry about, <br/>you know, stabbing you in the heart... 
<br/><br/>GILES <br/>How, how did you know it was me? <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>(quietly) 
<br/>Your eyes. There's only one <br/>person in the world who can look <br/>that 
annoyed with me. <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles smiles at her. A moment. 
<br/><br/><br/>
<center>ETHAN (O.S.) <br/>Is this going to go on much <br/>longer? I'd like to be 
going. <br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy crosses back over to Ethan. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Why would I let you go? <br/><br/>ETHAN <br/>Well, maybe 'cause 
you've got no <br/>choice. I'm human, you can't kill <br/>me. What's a Slayer 
gonna do to me? <br/></center><br/><br/>Riley ushers in two large, uniformed, US 
ARMY MPs. On of the MPs handcuffs Ethan. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>By the authority of the U.S. Military, <br/>you are being taken 
into custody <br/>pending a determination of your status. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>The MPs haul Ethan away. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY (cont'd) <br/>(to Buffy) <br/>They'll take Mr. Rayne to a secret 
<br/>detention facility in the Nevada <br/>desert. I'm sure he'll be rehabilitated 
<br/>in no time. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>I think I'd like to go watch them 
<br/>manhandle him into a vehicle. <br/></center><br/><br/>Giles exits. Buffy and 
Riley are left alone. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Thanks. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>I told you I'd help. <br/><br/>BUFFY 
<br/>You did. If I got here any later-- <br/>If Giles killed Ethan, I'd never 
<br/>have gotten him back. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>You'd find some other way. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Buffy shakes her head. After a beat: <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY (cont'd) <br/>You're really strong. Like, <br/>Spiderman strong. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Yes. I don't stick to stuff, but, yeah. <br/><br/>RILEY 
<br/>And... you're in charge. You're, <br/>like, make the plan, execute the 
<br/>plan, no one giving you orders. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>I'm a Slayer. 
<br/></center><br/><br/>She looks at him, asking the question without asking it. He 
smile, making a decision. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>I like it. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Yeah? <br/></center><br/><br/>Their 
gaze holds a beat. Then Riley nods, yes. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>RILEY <br/>(play it straight) <br/>But give me another oh, week to get 
<br/>ready and... I'll take you down. <br/></center><br/><br/>A beat and he breaks a 
smile, she smiles. Much mutual liking. <br/><br/>INT. GILES' APARTMENT -- DAY (DAY 
4) <br/><br/>Buffy sits on the arm of the sofa and looks on while Giles hooks up a 
new phone. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY <br/>Nice phone. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Yes. Fabulous technology. You 
<br/>see, if anyone has any information <br/>I need to know, they can simply 
<br/>tell me about it through this <br/>ingenious speaking tube. I'm very 
<br/>excited about it. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>I'm sorry, Giles. I really thought 
<br/>I'd told you about Riley and the <br/>Initiative... 
<br/></center><br/><br/>Finished with the phone, Giles moves around to sit in a 
chair near Buffy. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>... and I know that doesn't really <br/>help. It won't 
happen again. <br/>I'll tell you everything. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>Buffy, I don't 
want to ask you to <br/>betray any confidences, and I <br/>certainly don't want to 
interfere... <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>Uh-oh. You have but-face. <br/>(off his confused 
look) <br/>You're about to say "but..." <br/><br/>GILES <br/>But... this Initiative. 
I'm <br/>concerned. Ethan's not exactly a <br/>reliable source, but I'm not sure 
<br/>he's wrong about them. <br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>I'm not dating the Initiative. 
<br/>I'm dating Riley. And he's a <br/>good guy, Giles. <br/><br/>GILES <br/>I 
believe that, but... he's part <br/>of something we don't really <br/>understand. 
<br/><br/>BUFFY <br/>You sure you're not just saying <br/>I shouldn't date Riley 
because <br/>you don't like his boss? <br/><br/>GILES <br/>No, that's not what I'm 
saying at <br/>all... although I do hate her quite <br/>a lot. I want you to have 
your <br/>personal life, just... just keep <br/>your eyes open. Make sure you 
<br/>know what you're getting into. <br/></center><br/><br/>INT. HALLWAY -- THE 
INITIATIVE -- DAY (DAY 4) <br/><br/>Riley and Maggie walk down the h }{all 
together. <br/><br/><br/>
<center>MAGGIE <br/>So she walks in and the rules <br/>just suddenly... break. 
<br/><br/>RILEY <br/>Um... pretty much. <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>Be careful with her. She 
reacts <br/>on instinct. There's no <br/>discipline there. Her loyalties <br/>are 
uncertain. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>You won't be disappointed in her. <br/>She's good at 
what she does, and <br/>she has the... the truest soul I've <br/>ever known. 
<br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>(amused) <br/>Oh no. Spontaneous poetic <br/>exclamations. Lord 
spare me <br/>college boys in love. <br/><br/>RILEY <br/>I'm just saying she'll work 
out. <br/>You'll be proud of her. <br/><br/>MAGGIE <br/>You want to know what I 
think? <br/>(beat) <br/>I think you're probably right. <br/></center><br/><br/>Riley 
exits down the hallway. Maggie punches in a complex code and enters a room. As 
she enters we get a quick glimpse of a large form under a sheet on an examining 
table. The door closes, blocking our view. <br/><br/><i>On the door: room number 
314</i>. <br/><br/>BLACK OUT. <br/><br/><br/>END OF SHOW <br/>
