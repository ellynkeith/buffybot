      walking amid Riley's ash and rubble laden campsite. She looks around,

      <br/>In turmoil. I understand, <br/>brother. We have a lot to

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>Nothing. It was Mother -

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>Actually, the chip is here. 
      <br/>Tied directly into your central <br/>nervous system through the 
      <br/>thoracic nerve. This is phase <br/>one of your preparation. It <br/>lay 
      dormant until the time <br/>came. I simply activated it,

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>Disappointed by demonkind, 
      <br/>we turn to humans. Smart, <br/>adaptive, but emotional and weak. 
      <br/>Blind. There is imperfection <br/>everywhere. Something must <br/>be 
      done. Who will deliver us?</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>Mother. She creates me - 
      <br/>demon strength, human will, <br/>high-grade titanium. Evolution 
      <br/>through technology. I am the new <br/>standard for all living beings 
      and <br/>our mother knew that. She saw <br/>our future, yours and 
      mine.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley looks up at that.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>She saw that you are necessary. 
      <br/>She saw the role you will play <br/>by my side. Stand 
      up.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley obeys. Adam grips his shoulders, 
      fraternally.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>You see, we <u>are</u> 
      brothers, after all.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (O.S.)<br/>Warms the cockles of my 
      <br/>non-beating heart seeing you <br/>lads together.</font></center>

      cave's entrance.</font></p>
<p>

      Spike.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Yeah, well, I'm not much the 
      <br/>"being sent for" type. I'm more <br/>of a "I did my part, so get this 
      <br/>chip outta my head" kinda guy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike notices Riley and goes to him. Spike 
      snaps his fingers in his face, pushes against his chest - Riley can't 
      move.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Slightly stiffer than usual. 
      It's <br/>subtle, but I like it. What's with him?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>I activated his 
      chip.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

      Adam.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>She's separated from her 
      friends. <br/>They want nothing to do <br/>with her. She's all 
      alone.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>That's how I want her. 
      <u>Where</u> <br/>I want her is down in the Initiative.<br/>(to 
      Riley)<br/>She will ensure that as many demons <br/>die as humans. She will 
      achieve <br/>maximum carnage before she is <br/>too weak to go 
      on.</font></center>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Right. The Initiative. But 
      getting <br/>her there, that's what the bleeding <br/>disks are for, in'it? 
      The little witch <br/>gives her the info and - pop - Alice <br/>heads back 
      down the rabbit hole.</font></center>

<p></p>
<p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy stealthily, carefully, makes her way

      SQUEALS startle her, as do the occasional sound of FALLING PEBBLES 
      bouncing off the cave walls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She comes to a widening in the cave. This

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A well-concealed door SLIDES AWAY 
      revealing</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM and RILEY, standing in some secret 
      cave-like corridor. They step in. The door seals shut behind 
      them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>This is where it will all 
      happen. <br/>Where the new race begins.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">REVERSE ANGLE to see a large surgical lab, 
      with ten operating tables and several gurneys. A LARGE STEEL EXAMINATION 
      CHAIR rests against the wall, across the room. Various equipment at each 
      stations: bone saws, rib spreaders, transfusion pumps, etc.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Where are we?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>In the Initiative. There are 
      areas <br/>nobody knew about, beyond those <br/>who needed to. Mother kept 
      her <br/>secrets wellâ€¦</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Out of the corner of his eye, Riley sees 
      someone appear to his right. He turns to faceâ€¦</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MAGGIE WALSH - Ashen-faced, with mottled 
      skin, dead in the eyes, donning her usual lab coat which is now stained 
      with blood and god-knows what else. In her hands, a metal bowl.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>(to Walsh)<br/>Didn't 
      you?<br/>(to Riley)<br/>This is all as she planned it. <br/>Except she 
      thought she would be aliveâ€¦</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON RILEY's horrified expression. He stares 
      at her as she continues past himâ€¦</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY'S POV - He sees tubes (through one of 
      which is pumped a yellow-green fluid, and through another of which runs 
      red rich blood) and a steel cable protruding from her chest wound and 
      running into a BLINKING CYBERNETIC IMPLANT. (The size of a flattened 
      baseball) at the base of her skull.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Walsh joins a man, in hospital scrubs, with 
      a similar skull IMPLANT working at an operating station. The man places 
      some blood internal-organ like thing in the bowl, then turns to face 
      Adam.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's dead DR. ANGLEMAN, the tube and cable 
      running down his torso into his heart.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON RILEY, unable to move, reacts in confused 
      terror.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Are youâ€¦ is that what you're 
      <br/>going to do to me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>They are just workers. You 
      <br/>know your destiny is greater.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Walsh and Angleman move away from the table 
      and the subject they were working on sits up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON RILEY - His eyes widen as he 
      recognizes</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST. Or parts of him, attached to a 
      being that's alive and Adamized.</font></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Forrestâ€¦ No. Oh, 
      God.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">His head slowly turns to look at Riley. In 
      addition to a couple of minor cranial cybernetic implants, his lower lip 
      and jaw is all scabby demon, causing the top of his head - with the 
      Forrest features we recognize - to resemble a mask. When he speaks, his 
      voice possesses that deep, Adam-like digitized resonance.</font></p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>He's not worried you might 
      kill, oh, say, <u>him</u>?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(concerned)<br/>He's really 
      not.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SECRET LABORATORY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON ADAM</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who seems to sense somethingâ€¦ Turns to Spike 
      and Riley, full of anticipationâ€¦</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>She's coming. I can feel 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike takes this in. Riley's expression 
      registers that he understands, but he's powerless to take 
      action.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Good on you. Got a chunk of 
      <br/>prognosticating demon in there, eh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Spike jumps up on one of the operating 
      tables.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Now - if you'll just get this 
      chip outta <br/>my cranium, I'll be out of your way.<br/>(re: his 
      hair)<br/>And mind the hairline. Don't fancy <br/>fussing with a comb-over 
      once I <br/>resume my killing ways.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But to Spike's consternation - Adam doesn't 
      budge.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Come on now. We had a 
      deal.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>When she's 
here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES APARTMENT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles, Willow, Xander and Buffy look over an 
      array of weapons and spell materials, which are laid out on the coffee 
      table, couch and floorâ€¦</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>We have no lack of supplies - 
      I only <br/>wish I knew which ones would kill Adam.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>According to Riley, Adam's 
      power source <br/>comes from a uranium core embedded <br/>somewhere inside 
      his chest. Probably near the spine.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Great. So we just ask him to 
      lie down <br/>quietly while we do some exploratory surgery.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What about magic? Some kind 
      ofâ€¦ <br/>I don't know, uranium extracting spell.<br/>(squinting)<br/>I know. 
      I'm reaching.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Perhaps a paralyzing spell. 
      But I'm <br/>afraid I can't do the incantation for one of those 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Right. Don't you have to 
      speak it in <br/>Sumerian or something?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I do speak Sumerian. The 
      difficulty is, <br/>only an experienced witch can incant it <br/>- and you 
      have to be within striking <br/>distance of the subject.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>See what you 
      get for taking Spanish <br/>instead of Sumerian?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What was I 
      thinking?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>So - no problem. All we need 
      is <br/>a combo Buffy with slayer strength, <br/>Giles' multi-lingual 
      know-how and <br/>Willow's witchy power.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles shoots him a glance.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Yeah, don't tell me, I'm just 
      full of <br/>helpful suggestions.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>As a matter of fact, Xander, 
      you are.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The others now look at Giles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. LOWELL HOUSE - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">To establish.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LOWELL HOUSE - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander, Willow, Buffy and Giles move through 
      Lowell house, each carrying weapons and equipment. Their mood is tense, 
      poised for battle.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(to 
      Xander)<br/>Nervous?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>No way. I'm full of that good 
      old <br/>Kamikaze spirit.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Xander. Just because this can 
      never <br/>work is no reason to be negative.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now they arrive at the mirror that hides the 
      Initiative elevator.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Game faces, guys. We're going 
      in.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With that, Buffy unceremoniously SMASHES THE 
      MIRROR.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON BUFFY AND WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who are both wearing HARNESSES as, side by 
      side, they RAPPEL their way down the side of the elevator shaft. Buffy 
      notices that Willow looks a little frightened. A beat, then -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>How you doing?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Super. What was I thinking, 
      <br/>using stairs all this time?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay. Good.<br/>(a 
      beat/then)<br/>Willâ€¦</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Really, Buffy, it's not as 
      scary <br/>as I thought.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No. I was going to sayâ€¦ I'm 
      <br/>sorry. I hate that things have been <br/>so strained between all of 
      us.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow takes this in. Then -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It's not your fault. Spike 
      stirred up trouble.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But - I think trouble was stir 
      <br/>up-able. I think we've all sort <br/>of drifted apart this 
      yearâ€¦<br/>(off her silence)<br/>Don't you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(it's hard to admit)<br/>Maybe 
      a little. But, you know, first <br/>year of college. Hard to keep the 
      <br/>high school gang together.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But I <u>want</u> it together. 
      I miss you, <br/>and Xander - and Giles.<br/>(then)<br/>And it is my fault. 
      I've been a bad friend.<br/>I got so caught up in my own 
      stuff.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You're the slayer, Buffy. 
      Your stuff is <br/>pretty crucial.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I mean Riley. And - Riley, 
      mostly.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Both of the girls are growing more emotional 
      now.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I wasn't exactly Ms. 
      Available either. <br/>I kept secrets. I hid things from 
      everyone.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's not your fault. I mean, 
      you were <br/>going through something huge -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I wanted to tell you. But I 
      was so scaredâ€¦</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You can tell me anything, 
      Willow. <br/>I love you. You're my best friend.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Me too. I love you 
      too.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They try to rappel closer to one another, 
      hug. But it doesn't go very well. Instead they wait until they land on top 
      of the elevator - and practically fall into each other's arms.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Let's promise to never not 
      talk again -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I promise. I 
      promiseâ€¦</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now XANDER, who was following close behind 
      them, lands on the elevator. Before he knows what hit him, Buffy and 
      Willow are all over him with the hugs and kisses.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Xander!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Xander! Wonderful 
      Xander!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander reacts with confusion - then, with 
      mounting anxiety.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Xander - you know we love you, 
      right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>We do. 
      Totally.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Oh god. We're gonna die, 
      aren't we?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No - we just missed 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The girls squeeze him even more tightly. 
      Xander, sandwiched between his two hugging friends, finally goes with it 
      and grins goofilyâ€¦ Looks up at the descending Giles.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(calling up)<br/>Giles, hurry 
      up! You definitely want <br/>to get down here for this.</font></center>

alone.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike rushes back to the monitor. We see 
      what he sees: Xander, Giles, and Willow being escorted behind Buffy. 
      Spike's face falls.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>You failed me 
      again.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>That's one way of looking at 
      it.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>What's the other 
      way?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike RUNS</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Right into Forrest. Who easily holds him 
      with a vise-like grip. Spike struggles - he's going nowhere.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Oh, come on! It's not like I 
      wasn't trying!<br/>That's worth something, right?</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>I suppose... Yes - I will honor 
      our<br/>agreement and remove your chip.<br/>(to Forrest)<br/>Take his head 
      off.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest pulls Spike closer to the table, 
      when Spike manages to bring up his arm and jab his lit cigarette in 
      Forrest's eye. It burns with a SIZZLE, the pain causing Forrest to release 
      his grip. Spike takes off. Forrest starts after him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>Let him go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest stops, looks to Adam. Adam's still
