<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Picks up not long after the (next to) last 
      scene of Episode 13 ended. Buffy, Giles, Xander, Willow, Spike, and Anya 
      are discussing Buffy's announcement that Sunnydale's no longer safe for 
      any of them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(mid-explanation)<br/>...so 
      Maggie sends me down into<br/>the sewers with one of those<br/>blasto guns. 
      Next thing I know,<br/>it's raining monsters.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Hallelujah.<br/>(off their 
      looks)<br/>What? She was asking for it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(ignoring)<br/>And this 
      <u>gate</u> slams down behind<br/>me... and I try to use the gun,<br/>but it 
      goes, pffft! </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>You're saying Maggie set you 
      up?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's what I'm saying. She 
      sent <br/>me on a one-way recon. </font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The gang absorbs the fact that Maggie is of 
      the bad. Then -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Got to hand it to you, 
      Goldilocks,<br/>you have bleedin' tragic taste<br/>in men. I have a cousin, 
      married<br/>a regurgitating Frovlax demon, has<br/>better instincts than 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What does my taste in men have 
      to <br/>do with this? </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>You think Riley was off 
      knitting<br/>booties for your future offspring<br/>while Maggie was 
      stringing you up?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The others look on guiltily. They'd had the 
      same thought. But this stops Buffy. She hadn't considered it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley? You think that he had 
      <br/>something to do with this?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Probably not. But we'd be 
      remiss<br/>if we didn't think through all 
      the<br/>possibilities.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(shaken)<br/>Right... 
      Remiss.<br/>(then)<br/>I - no... I mean, no. Maggie<br/>made sure he was 
      nowhere around<br/>when she handed out the very<br/>special "make Buffy 
      dead"<br/>assignment.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Plus, Riley - he seems like 
      he <br/>wouldn't tell a white lie, let <br/>alone a whole lot of big, 
      fat<br/>dirty ones.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>That's why they call them 
      "secret" <br/>forces, Will. 'Cause they kind of<br/>keep the whole lying 
      thing to<br/>themselves.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(back on topic)<br/>All I know 
      is that Maggie has it<br/>in for me. And that means The<br/>Initiative has 
      it in for me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Scary, on so many levels. 
      </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Right. I'm guessing the 
      mad<br/>scientist isn't too keen on the<br/>fact that the entire Scooby 
      Gang<br/>knows The Initiative is up to no<br/>good.</font></center>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I still don't understand, 
      Buffy.<br/>What happened that would make <br/>Maggie want to kill 
      you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't know. She didn't dig 
      the<br/>fact that I was asking a lot of<br/>questions, that's for 
      sure.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>So - you were getting too close 
      to<br/>something.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(gravely)<br/>Clearly. I can 
      only imagine what she <br/>was so desperate to hide.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. WOODS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A quiet, misty clearing in the woods. Then, 
      in the middle of it, a steel door SLAMS OPEN, violently displacing the 
      dirt and grass that covered it. Out of this secret opening appears ADAM, 
      Maggie's experiment and killer, who crawls out and gains his feet 
      awkwardly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He lumbers forward - taking in the world 
      around him with rapt fascination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then he moves into the woods, which is

<p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy sees him and they move together, 
      extremely relieved and glad to see each other. Any doubts or questions 
      they have are clearly overshadowed by their need for each 
other.</font></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I know something went down. 
      Tell me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Maggie - she tried to kill 
      me</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley tries to process this. It's difficult. 
      As he does:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>It didn't work, but they're 
      all<br/>upset anyway. </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(hard)<br/>There's no mistake. 
      And how do <br/>you know something happened?<br/>Where were 
      you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley's spinning, trying to piece it all 
      together.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I was on a mission, but I 
      came<br/>back and... I - I'm not sure.<br/>Let's just, keep our heads. 
      Not<br/>jump to any -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But he stops, his attention drawn across the

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy follows his gaze. Sees that he's 
      looking at SPIKE, who has also tensed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley pushes back from Buffy. Even more

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's - his name is Spike. 
      It's<br/>a... really long story. But he's <br/>not bad 
      anymore.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Hey! What am I? A 
      bleedin'<br/>broken record? I'm <u>bad</u>.<br/>(to Riley)<br/>It's just, I 
      can't bite anymore,<br/>thanks to you wankers.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>We've been looking all over

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(heads for the 
      door)<br/>Leaving you swabs to your<br/>dramatics, thanks. Got my 
      stories<br/>on the telly for that.<br/>(to Riley)<br/>By the by, if you are 
      trying to <br/>kill her --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He gives Riley TWO THUMBS UP, 
      bails.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(spun)<br/>Buffy - what is 
      this? You're hiding <br/>an HST?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander, fuming now, stands - gets in Riley's 
      face a little.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Maybe you should back off and 
      let<br/>her ask the questions, Jack. Your<br/>boss just tried to make 
      monster<br/>food out of her.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley stops, realizes that everyone, save 
      Buffy, is looking at him a little accusingly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I didn't see much. I wasn't 
      there...<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>All I know is, Professor Walsh<br/>told me you 
      were dead. But then<br/>I saw you on the monitors...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley's clearly starting to flood. This is 
      all too much to digest at once.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY (cont'd)<br/>This isn't Professor 
      Walsh. There<br/>must be something making her act<br/>this way. Something, I 
      don't <br/>know, controlling her...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And it keeps coming, too fast -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>We think Buffy was becoming 
      too<br/>inquisitive. That she may have<br/>been getting close to 
      something<br/>Dr. Walsh was trying to hide. Any<br/>idea what that might 
      be?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What about 314? Maybe that's 
      it -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Maybe she was 
      trying to test you?<br/>What if it was only a drill -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Then why did she tell you I 
      was<br/>dead? Riley - this was no test -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I've heard rumors. That 
      The<br/>Initiative isn't what we've been<br/>told. That, secretly, they 
      are<br/>working toward some darker <br/>purpose... Something that 
      might<br/>harm us all -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No. That's - that's not 
      what<br/>happens there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley - </font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She reaches for him, but he pulls back - 
      reeling.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You have no right... I mean, 
      I<br/>think I would know if...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY <br/>Nobody's sure of anything 
      yet.<br/>We're just trying to sort it out -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley starts to head for the 
door.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I - I can't be here. I'll sort

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/><u>No</u>. Just - I'm 
      sorry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And he goes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OFF BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Looking after him, also feeing confused and 
      lost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. WOODS - DUSK</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Adam comes to the edge of the woods - sees a 
      house in a clearing and a BOY (7 or 8) playing with his toys in the back 
      yard. (We should note that he's playing with a cyborg type action figure 
      that isn't entirely unlike Adam himself.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Adam, intrigued with this small person, 
      moves closer. The boy looks up - sees Adam. Adam draws back, afraid the 
      kid's going to scream. But the boy doesn't - instead he drops his toy, 
      comes forward, as interested in Adam as Adam is in him. A beat - then Adam 
      speaks.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>What am I?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BOY<br/>You're a

      know. I just do.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then the boy notices Adam's arm with the

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BOY (cont'd)<br/>What's this 
      for?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Adam considers telling him. Or showing him.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's late and the campus is fairly deserted. 
      Riley walks alone, thinking. Trying to puzzle out what happened with 
      Maggie and Buff. Trying to figure out what he's going to do...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INITIATIVE - ROOM 314 - 
NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dr. Angleman enters the darkened room. He

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. ANGLEMAN<br/>Dr. 
      Walsh?<br/></font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Nothing. He moves deeper into the room. 
      Alarmed, he sees that ADAM has escaped his restraints and is not on the 
      table. Then he looks to a far wall, sees that a security panel has been 
      ripped off the wall and a number of electrical wires hang torn from 
      it.</font></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. ANGLEMAN

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Again. Nothing. Terrified, he starts to back

      intensely uncomfortable. He's clearly slept with a blanket on a plastic 
      blow-up chair. On the Girl's side, we see Buffy, Anya, and Willow, still 
      under the covers on Xander's bed - watching A ROADRUNNER CARTOON (a 
      wonderful WARNER BROTHER'S cartoon!) Buffy, worried and distracted, is 
      clearly not enjoying the animated diversion.</font></p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't know. Seems like

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'll try to remember that.

      dead.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy takes this in, stunned by the 
      news.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY (cont'd)<br/>You happy 
      now?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now she's appalled by Riley's coldness. A 
      horrible beat, then -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Happy? How can you say that? 
      Of<br/>course I'm not. What happened?<br/>Who killed her?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>That's 
      classified.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Classified? Riley 
      -<br/>(holding it together)<br/>The Polgara. It got her - then it 
      escaped.<br/>(nothing from him)<br/>Didn't it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley finally nods. Buffy can't contain her 
      hurt at his behavior. </font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I'm going to find it. 
      I'll find it and <br/>destroy it. Then you'll stop asking <br/>how "happy" 
      all this death makes me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She turns and walks away. Once she does, 
      Riley's facade cracks and it's clear that he's conflicted - feels bad 
      about hurting her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. TARA'S ROOM - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara responds to a knock at the door. It's 
      Willow. Tara reacts with happy surprise.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Howdy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I just got your message a 
      minute <br/>ago - I was in class. But I was<br/>about to call 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara stands back, welcomes Willow 
      in.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I had so much fun the other 
      night.<br/>Those spells...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Yeah, that was 
      nice.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(awkward)<br/>I hope you don't 
      think I just come<br/>over for the spells and<br/>everything. I mean, I 
      really like<br/>just talking and hanging out with<br/>you and 
      stuff.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I know 
      that.<br/>(then/smiling)<br/>But you want to do a spell.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(sheepishly)<br/>Yeah. But 
      only because it's really <br/>important. There's this - </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(gently interrupting)<br/>You 
      don't have to explain. I don't <br/>mind. Really.<br/>(shyly)<br/>I've been 
      thinking about that last<br/>spell we did all day.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(pleased)<br/>You have? 
      Oh.<br/>(then/excited)<br/>This one should be fun too. We <br/>conjure the 
      Goddess Thespia to<br/>help us locate the demonic energy<br/>in the area. 
      Shouldn't be too tricky.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara looks a little uncertain at 
      this.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>The Goddess Thespia? Are you 
      sure<br/>we're ready for that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(mock scoffing)<br/>You and 
      me? This is beneath us.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara takes this in. Finally 
      smiles.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Okay. If you say so. 
      </font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A squad of Initiative guys sweeps the 
      graveyard, heading into various crypts two at a time. Forrest and Graham, 
      itching for the kill, are among them. They enter a crypt.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CRYPT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest and Graham look around the crypt. To 
      their surprise it's lit with candles and sparsely furnished with an old 
      arm chair, a rickety TV tray and a television that's hooked up to its own 
      little generator.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>What do you think? A homeless 
      guy? </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Could be. Or a squatter of 
      the <br/>demon variety.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>But not the 
      Polgara.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Who cares. I see a demon, it 
      dies.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Graham feels the top of the TV.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Warm.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest NODS to the sarcophagus that 
      dominates the room. They drag the lid off it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON INTERIOR OF SARCOPHAGUS</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Nothing but a female skeleton in a Victorian 
      dress inside. They turn away from the sarcophagus.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>(frustrated)<br/>Damn!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As he says it a frustrated Forrest shatters 
      the TV screen with the butt of his gun.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST 
      (cont'd)<br/>Animals...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They exit. A long moment passes, then - 
      </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON INTERIOR OF SARCOPHAGUS</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where we see SPIKE emerge from under the 
      poofy skirts of the victorian dress the corpse wears (he's turned so that 
      his feet are under her head, and his head lies under his legs...) He pulls 
      himself out of the sarcophagus, looking a little shaken. That was a close 
      call.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. WILLY'S BAR - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The dingy bar looks a little different than 
      the last time we saw it. The place is still a hole - but there have been 
      small attempts at improvements; a green neon sign on one wall reads 
      WILLY'S PLACE, a snazzy pinball machine sits in one corner. The bar is 
      doing fair business - a gnarled demon sits huddled at a back table. A 
      vampire sits with another demon at the bar...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then there are a few low-life humans mixed 
      into the bunch. Everybody pretty much minding their own business. BUFFY 
      enters, finds Willy behind the bar. He's understandably less than happy to 
      see her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He gestures for her to move with him to a 
      dark end of the bar - away from the customers. He glances around 
      nervously.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>Aw man. You're killing me 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I missed you too. Joint's 
      jumping.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>Yeah, you know... I'm making 
      some<br/>changes with my life. Getting <br/>away from my old 
      image.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What, you mean, as a 
      double<br/>dealing snitch?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>Uh huh. I know you're gonna 
      think<br/>I'm blowing smoke - but after<br/>those apocalypse demons nearly 
      did<br/>me in, I had an experience of the<br/>spiritual variety 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy doesn't have any time for this 
      nonsense.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's swell, really, but I 
      still<br/>need to know if you've heard <br/>anything about a Polgara 
      demon<br/>doing some killing over the last<br/>few days.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>See - that's the thing. I 
      don't<br/>talk behind people's backs no more.<br/>(indicates the 
      sign)<br/>And I'm trying to give the joint<br/>some class. It's Willy's 
      "place"<br/>now, see? Brings in a better<br/>clientele.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy glances around the room a little 
      dubiously.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY (cont'd)<br/>And I got a deep 
      fryer. These<br/>demons just go crazy for 
      chicken<br/>fingers.<br/>(desperate)<br/>If they see me dealing with you 
      -<br/>then I'm just the same old Willy,<br/>working both sides of the 
      street.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's just about had it. Threatens 
      -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm going to have to punch 
      you,<br/>aren't I?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>(conspiratorially)<br/>Just 
      once, and it don't have to hurt - <br/>just make it look 
      good.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy hauls back, but before she hits him - 
      Willy YELLS with pain -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(sotto)<br/>Not yet. I didn't 
      touch you -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>Okay, sorry, sorry. Go 
      again.<br/>(loudly/dramatic)<br/>No! I can't talk to -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy HITS him in the face. He cries out for 
      real this time. Takes a long beat while he recovers. Buffy's all 
      business.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>The Polgara. What do you 
      know?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>(still in pain)<br/>Heard there 
      was one around a week<br/>or two back. Word was you got<br/>him, you and 
      those army guys.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And that was the last you 
      heard.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>Yeah. Far as I know he's been 
      off<br/>the streets.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy takes this in. Then - </font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What about those "army" 
      guys?<br/>What's the talk about them?<br/>Anybody mentioned something 
      called<br/>314?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>I've heard stuff. Mostly 
      stories,<br/>you know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willy stops, tenses. Buffy follows his gaze 
      and, much to her surprise, sees that RILEY has stepped into the bar. 
      Again, his expression is dark, intense. He's also looking a little ill, 
      sweaty, pale, and continues to, absentmindedly, scratch at his right hand. 
      Buffy, angry that he followed her, moves to him and speaks before he has a 
      chance.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What are you doing? Following 
      me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You told me you were tracking 
      the<br/>Polgara demon. I was going to help you.<br/>(angrily)<br/>But now I 
      see you're not hunting<br/>demons - you're socializing with<br/>them. Again. 
      I thought you were<br/>supposed to be killing these guys,<br/>not buying 
      them drinks. </font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">At that the place goes pretty much silent. A 
      number of demons turn to look at the slayer and her heavily armed friends. 
      Naturally, they react with some anxiety.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Smooth, Officer Riley. They 
      teach<br/>you those undercover moves in<br/>special forces?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm serious, Buffy. What are 
      you<br/>doing here?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willy pipes up nervously, trying to 
      help.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>Just cooling her dogs like the 
      rest of <br/>us. Now why don't you relax - </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(ignoring/to Buffy)<br/>I want 
      you to tell me. Who are<br/>you, really?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>No kidding, let me get you 
      some<br/>chicken fingers on the house -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(to Willy/hard)<br/>Hey. Think 
      you could shut up?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>I'm just saying - 
      </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I said shut up. Or maybe 
      you'd<br/>like to go back to the lab with me. <br/>I'm sure the coats would 
      love to <br/>classify a - whatever you are.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Leave him. He's human 
      -<br/>(then)<br/>Riley, you're shaking - </font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley ignores this - stays focused on 
      Willy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>So - he's human. He just 
      harbors<br/>demons.. Which makes him a good<br/>guy like 
you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now he grabs Buffy, pulls her close. Burning 
      -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY (cont'd)<br/>The truth, Buffy. 
      Now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy also hardens. She doesn't put up with 
      this crap. Not from anybody.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You have the truth. You're 
      just<br/>too screwed up to see it now <br/>because of what happened 
      to<br/>Professor Walsh. Now let me go -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But she can see that Riley isn't listening. 
      His focus has shifted to a LADY who is trying to sneak out of the bar. 
      This seems to be the straw for Riley. He loses it. </font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Hold it - you!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He casts Buffy off, grabs the lady. It's 
      clear just from looking at her that she's a drunk, but no 
demon.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY (cont'd)<br/>(to lady)<br/>No 
      leaving till I say so, got it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He holds the pistol to the poor lady's head. 
      A tense moment - everybody's frozen and terrified. Then Willy again tries 
      to intercede.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLY<br/>Hey! We got new rules in here, 
      no killing -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Riley keeps the pistol to the lady's 
      head.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Right. Except - it seems like 
      the<br/>rules don't apply much these days,do they?<br/>(to lady)<br/>Like, if 
      I shot you right now, I don't <br/>know if I'd have a corpse on my hands 
      <br/>or one pissed off vampire -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley - </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(ignoring)<br/>I mean, who do 
      you believe? First<br/>it sounds like lies. Then it sounds <br/>like 
      truth...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now the lady squeezes her eyes shut, mutters 
      a prayer... This seems to wake something inside Riley, some kind of reason 
      - he looks over to Buffy and sees her horrified expression.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley, no.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anguished, Riley turns back to the terrified 
      lady, raises the gun up - as if going to pistol whip her - then SLAMS it 
      down hard on a BOWL of nuts resting on the bar. The bowl EXPLODES from the 
      impact sending Willy cowering. The lady YELPS and staggers away. 
      </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley looks at his hands - they're shaking 
      terribly. He turns to Buffy - a look of desperation crossing his features. 
      </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON RILEY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who is sitting on Xander's bed, head in 
      hands. He's sweating and dizzy, shaking like a leaf. Buffy moves to him, 
      gently puts a blanket around his shoulders. He startles at her touch, but 
      then seems to realize that it's her and calms a bit.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Why don't you lie down? You'll 
      be<br/>more comfortable.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley pulls the blanket around him, but 
      remains sitting. Buffy notices that Riley is scratching at his hand rather 
      vigorously. She looks at his hand, gasps.</font></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(alarmed)<br/>No. You're 
      hurting yourself. Come on -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She removes the scarf she wears on her head, 
      and wraps Riley's hand in it. Looks at him tenderly.</font></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Stop, 
      okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They connect for a moment as Riley nods, 
      responding to her gentle touch. But then his look shifts to one of 
      desperation.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I thought I knew. But I 
      don't... I don't <br/>know anything.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No. Don't even think 
      that.<br/>(then)<br/>Now listen to me. You just need to <br/>get some sleep. 
      Come on, lie down.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">After a long beat, he does. Buffy covers him 
      with the blanket, which seems to have little impact on his violent 
      shaking. Buffy sits with him for a beat.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You're going to be 
      okay...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley doesn't respond to this, just closes 
      his eyes. Buffy looks at him for a moment, worried. Then she gets up and 
      crosses to the other side of the room, where Xander, Anya and Giles are 
      researching.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>How is he?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy has switched into high slayer-mode 
      now. She's ready to kick a little butt to help her boyfriend.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>This isn't just grief making 
      him act <br/>this way. Something's affecting him <br/>physically - and it's 
      getting worse.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>You think Professor Walsh 
      did<br/>something to him?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't know. But I'm ready to 
      <br/>find out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>That's going to be tough, 
      what<br/>with Maggie's deadness and all.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>She must have kept 
      records<br/>somewhere. About Riley and 314<br/>and all of it. And I doubt 
      she was <br/>the only person at the Initiative who <br/>knew what she was up 
      to.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>So what's the 
      plan?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Giles and Anya will keep 
      researching. <br/>Xander, you and I will go in undercover.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(alarmed, to Buffy)<br/>Hey, 
      remember before? No Xander.<br/>Not in a boyfriend-way or a 
      lead-<br/>him-to-certain-death-way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>He's the only one with 
      military<br/>experience.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>It's not like he was in "the 
      Nam."<br/>He was G.I. Joe for one night.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander sees her alarm, moves closer. Moved 
      by her concern.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>It's okay, Anya. I've backed 
      Buffy <br/>up before.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(meekly)<br/>Can't you find 
      another way to help<br/>these guys, like Xerox the handouts <br/>or 
      something?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I'll be careful, 
      promise.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They hug briefly then Buffy and Xander start 
      gathering weapons, military gear, etc.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(back on topic)<br/>How do you 
      plan on getting inside<br/>The Initiative, Buffy? Surely<br/>their security 
      system is almost<br/>impenetrable.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I have my clearance. I'm 
      hoping<br/>Maggie never had time to revoke it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>As for the whereabouts of 
      the<br/>Polgara demon, Buffy, I'm afraid<br/>we haven't turned up much. 
      There's <br/>been no report of him since his capture.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Then we'll just have to keep 
      looking.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. TARA'S ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara and Willow sit on the floor, surrounded 
      by candles. In front of them lies some yarn, which is laid out in the 
      shape of a square and held down by crystals at each of the four corners. 
      Willow uses a mortar and pestle to grind spell ingredients 
      together.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(re: square on floor)<br/>So 
      this square is Sunnydale?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(smiles)<br/>Right. It's like 
      a map. We each<br/>take different parts of the potion - <br/>and when we do 
      the incantation, <br/>we blow it onto the square at the <br/>exact same 
      time.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>But how does it 
      work?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>That's the cool part. When 
      the potion <br/>mixes and Thespia is called, it <br/>creates a mist over the 
      parts where <br/>the demons are. It even makes <br/>different colors for 
      different breeds.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Wow.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow finishes grinding.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You ready?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara nods - holds out her hand. Willow pours 
      some spell ingredients into it. Then pours the contents of the mortar into 
      her own hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Let's do 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They close their eyes. Concentrate for a 
      beat. Then -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Thespia, we walk in shadow, 
      walk<br/>in blindness. You are the protector <br/>of the 
      night.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Thespia, goddess, ruler of 
      all<br/>darkness - we implore you - open<br/>a window to the world of 
      the<br/>underbeing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow nods the cue to Tara, then blows her 
      spell ingredients onto the map. Tara, however, briefly opens her eyes and 
      looks for a place to stash the ingredients. Finally, she shoves them 
      between her mattresses. Holds her empty hand aloft again, as Willow 
      does.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>With your knowledge, 
      may we go in<br/>safety. With your grace, may we<br/>speak of your 
      benevolence.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat, then Willow, excited, opens her 
      eyes. Looks at the map. Nothing happened. Her expression falls.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Or 
      not.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OFF TARA</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Trying to conceal her guilt.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LOWELL HOUSE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy does the "scientist" look with glasses 
      and her hair up in a neat bun. She also has a white lab coat over her arm, 
      but it's folded so you can't really tell what it is. Xander, in commando 
      gear, covers her as they move cautiously through Lowell house. The place 
      looks pretty empty. They whisper -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Things seem 
      quiet.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Usually are this time of 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They are interrupted by a GUY RUNNING DOWN 
      THE STAIRS, they duck behind them. Go mercifully unnoticed as the guy 
      barrels out the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cautiously, they venture out again. This 
      time they make it all the way to the MIRRORED ENTRANCE TO THE INITIATIVE 
      ELEVATOR. Buffy stops near the mirror. Xander, a little confused, does the 
      same.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Buff, maybe you should check 
      the<br/>look later.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Shhh. Just -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She stops as something occurs to her. She 
      violently SHOVES Xander far away from the mirror.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Ow! What was that 
      for?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Sorry. It's just - I'm the 
      only<br/>one who can pass the retinal scan.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>The - eeeew! I don't want to 
      see that!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Buffy stands in the center of the 
      mirror. Faces it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Retinal scan, 
      Xander.<br/>(tense)<br/>In a few seconds we'll find out if<br/>my clearance 
      is still good.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The scan starts. Xander watches 
      nervously.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Or if we're about to die at 
      the hands <br/>of fifty grief-fueled military goons...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A tense moment. Then the elevator opens. 
      Buffy breathes a sigh of relief. But Xander still looks a little 
      uncertain.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Why am I not 
      entirely comforted by<br/>the arrival of the 
      man-sized<br/>microwave?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy ignores him, stepping in. Xander 
      follows. The elevator doors close.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INITIATIVE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The elevator opens. Xander covers Buffy 
      while they step out. Buffy is now wearing her lab coat, and the scientist 
      look is complete. Xander starts to lead the way, but stops - taking in the 
      enormity of the Initiative operation with amazement.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Holy moly.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I totally get it now. Can I 
      have sex <br/>with Riley too?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy just pushes him ahead. They turn a 
      corner into a -</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HALLWAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where they see a pair of guys walking toward 
      them, deep in conversation. They both tense up, not sure what to 
      do.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>(whispers)<br/>Quick. 
      Pretend to make out with me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY <br/>(also whispering)<br/>What? 
      What are you talking about?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Well, I... You know, I 
      just...in the <br/>movies, the guy and the girl have <br/>to hide 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Please. Do you think we could 
      draw <br/>more attention to ourselves?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander looks chastised - especially as the 
      approaching guys pass them without giving them a second look.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WE HOLD, while Buffy and Xander move off 
      down the hallway.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>This is the 
      Initiative, Xander.<br/>Scientists and military guys don't<br/>make out with 
      each other...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Well, hey. Maybe that's 
      what's<br/>wrong with the world. Ever think<br/>about that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. XANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON RILEY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who sleeps fitfully on Xander's bed on one 
      side of the dividing curtain, which is closed. We hear -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (O.S)<br/>I totally 
      failed...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And now we go to -</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who, frustrated, talks with Giles and Anya. 
      They sit on the other side of the dividing curtain.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It wasn't even like the spell 
      went<br/>wrong. It just - wouldn't.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Well, if it makes you feel 
      better,<br/>we didn't fare much better here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Really? Is Riley 
      okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>He's asleep, finally, but he 
      doesn't <br/>look good... And the research has <br/>been troubling as well. 
      This demon <br/>we're dealing with seems highly <br/>atypical for a Polgara. 
      The child it <br/>killed was mutilated, and there's no <br/>recorded case of 
      a Polgara ever doing <br/>such a thing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Also - Polgaras have to eat 
      about<br/>every two hours. Factor in the<br/>low I.Q. - and you've got a 
      demon<br/>who's not very low profile.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Over the following, Willow takes off her 
      jacket, moves to the curtain...</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>So - how has he been hiding 
      in<br/>Sunnydale for the last two days<br/>without anybody seeing 
      him?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Exactly -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow pulls the curtain aside. JUMP (as 
      should we) when she sees RILEY standing there. Still very ill, he appears 
      shaky and pale - and a tad demented.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh! God, you 
-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Where's Buffy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's clear from the look in his eyes and his 
      tone, that he's back in the angry place.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>She went out. Can I get 
      you<br/>something?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley moves back to the edge of the bed, 
      starts putting his shoes on.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Just tell me where she 
      is.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>You're not well, Riley. You 
      need<br/>to rest.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Did she find the Polgara? Is 
      that it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>No. We're still looking, but 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>But what?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>She went to find out what's 
      making<br/>you sick, Riley.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley burns at this.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm not sick. You're telling 
      me she <br/>went to the Initiative?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>She's just trying to help you 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley grabs the rest of his stuff. Heads for 
      the door.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>She doesn't belong 
      there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles is on the other side of the bed and 
      unable to move fast enough to stop him. Willow, closest to Riley, moves in 
      front of him. Tries to block his route to the stairs.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Riley, listen 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Stand away from the 
      stairs.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No. You're going to get her 
      killed <br/>if you -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Riley isn't even listening. He roughly 
      PUSHES HER ASIDE and she hits the concrete floor, hard. Cries out. Giles 
      and Anya are at her side now, trying to help. Riley bolts up the stairs 
      and out the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INITIATIVE - HALLWAY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander still covers Buffy while they move 
      cautiously down a hall. Then they overhear some scientists talking around 
      a corner and stop. It's DR. ANGLEMAN and a colleague.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. ANGLEMAN<br/>How many of the men are

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. ANGLEMAN<br/>It's dangerous. I don't 
      want to think <br/>about the damage our guys could do <br/>under the stress

      happening to them -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SCIENTIST #1<br/>We've located all but a

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then Angleman comes down the hallway. Buffy 
      signals for Xander to move with her as she follows after Angleman, slowly 
      closing the gap between him and them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angleman walks down the lengthy hall, then 
      turns and goes down ANOTHER LONG HALLWAY for some distance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Finally, Angleman uses his passcard to enter 
      a CLASSIFIED AREA, and Buffy and Xander stay close enough behind him that 
      they just manage to get through the door after him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INITIATIVE - CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AREA 
      - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angleman, Buffy, and Xander are now in a 
      large document vault. The first level is all file cabinets and such, while 
      the second level holds the computer data and is accessed by a CATWALK 
      which lines all four walls of the room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angleman moves to one of the file cabinets, 
      but before he gets there, Buffy grabs him, throws him against the wall. 
      Xander watches for intruders.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You know, I don't generally 
      like to kill <br/>humans - but I've learned it pays to be <br/>flexible in 
      life.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. ANGLEMAN<br/>I was wondering when 
      you'd turn up.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(mock disappointment)<br/>Oh - 
      darn - so this wasn't a surprise.<br/>(deadly)<br/>I want you to tell me 
      what you did to <br/>Riley. And after that, we can take a <br/>tour of room 
      314.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. ANGLEMAN<br/>Somebody's coming, you 
      know. I'm <br/>sure they've already seen you on<br/>the security monitors 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now we hear RILEY, as he steps in from

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(cold)<br/>Monitors are 
      non-functional at this time, sir.<br/>(stares hard at Buffy)<br/>Went down

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What? I didn't

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(interrupting)<br/>Thank God

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. ANGLEMAN<br/>Finn. Take this girl to

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley - he can tell us what we 
      need <br/>to know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley doesn't acknowledge her - but he also 
      doesn't move to stop her. Angleman becomes visibly more terrified as he 
      realizes that he has to fend for himself here.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>(roughly/to

<p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Riley has gotten upset again. Can't

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(interrupting/to

      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. ANGLEMAN<br/>She was. It's not

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>All she was trying to do was 
      help<br/>people - and this is how you want<br/>them to remember 
      her?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley. Listen - I heard 
      Angleman<br/>say that she was feeding you drugs -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley gets in her face.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No! You're doing this to me, 
      aren't <br/>you? This all started because of you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>If you'll just listen. All I'm 
      trying to <br/>do is help you get to the truth -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You want truth? Then tell 
      me!<br/>What did you do to her, Buffy?!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Stop it! I didn't do 
      anything!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley moves to grab her again but she BLOCKS 
      him and HITS HIM ONCE, he staggers back - but doesn't fall. He's starting 
      to come back at her, but Buffy backs away - not wanting this 
      fight.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Riley - stop. This is

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, Riley, Angleman and Xander look up at 
      Adam, who paces on the cat walk above them. Adam speaks with the care and 
      deliberateness of someone who is just learning the language.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>I've been thinking... About the 
      world. <br/>I wanted to see it. Learn it. I saw the <br/>inside of that boy, 
      and it was <br/>beautiful, but it didn't tell me about <br/>the world. It 
      just made me feel. So <br/>now I want to know about me. Why <br/>I feel. 
      What I am.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Adam STEPS off the catwalk, lands easily in 
      front of them. Riley, Buffy and the others react with stunned silence - 
      both to his leap and his frightening, pieced-together 
      appearance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Adam reaches into a pocket in his vest 
      and takes a FLOPPY DISK out of it that reads "ADAM"</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM (cont'd)<br/>So I came 
      home.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He slips it into a HARD DRIVE in his chest. 
      Immediately begins to process information, which he relays to the 
      others.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM (cont'd)<br/>I am a kinematically 
      redundant,<br/>bio-mechanical demonoid. Designed<br/>by Maggie Walsh. She 
      called me<br/>Adam, and I called her "Mother".</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angleman, alarmed, tries to get control of 
      the situation. Speaks to Adam as firmly as he can through his 
      fear.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. ANGLEMAN<br/>Adam. Maggie would want 
      you to<br/>stand down.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>Yes. But I seem to have a 
      design flaw.</font></center>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Buffy notes the ARM OF THE POLGARA which 
      now belongs to ADAM. Gets it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>She pieced you together out of 
      parts <br/>of other demons.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>And man. And machine. Which

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(disgusted)<br/>She wasn't your

<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Adam reaches into his vest again. Pulls out 
      another disk. "FINN". He switches it into his disc drive, starts reading 
      information.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>Riley Finn...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY AND XANDER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tense, they move to position themselves 
      between Riley and Adam, prepared to act if they have to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BACK ON RILEY AND ADAM</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Stop. Those files 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>(cutting him 
      off/interested)<br/>Oh. Mother created you too.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Maggie's not my mother. I have 
      a <br/>mother. A real -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>A birth mother. But after you 
      met<br/>Maggie, she was the one who shaped<br/>your basic operating system. 
      She<br/>taught you how to think, how to <br/>feel. She fed you chemicals to 
      make <br/>you stronger, your mind and body... <br/>She said that you and I 
      were her <br/>favorite children, her art. That <br/>makes us brothers... 
      family.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Unable to hear any more, Riley moves 
      forward, menacing. Buffy and Xander tense, ready to intervene.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No. I am not like 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Adam is completely unthreatened. Instead 
      he looks at Riley, fascinated. Moves closer, studies the expression on his 
      face.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>That's pain, isn't it? Why? 
      Because <br/>your feeding schedule, the chemicals, <br/>have been 
      interrupted? Or do you miss <br/>her? Tell me -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(reaching his limit)<br/>I'll 
      kill you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>You won't. You haven't 
      been<br/>programmed to.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(desperate)<br/>I can not be 
      programmed. I'm a man.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Again - Adam pulls out another disk. Says 
      simply -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>It's here. The plan she had for 
      us. <br/>What happens. How it ends.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>Do you want to 
      hear?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley pulls his gun. Aims it straight into 
      Adam's face. Buffy rushes forward, grabs for Riley's arm but Adam smacks 
      the gun out of his hand and knocks Buffy on her ass at the same 
      time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley reaches back and PUNCHES ADAM. This 
      doesn't seem to phase Adam a bit. He simply knocks Riley back with one 
      hand. It looks effortless - but the blow sends Riley flying. Riley lands 
      hard, dazed.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Buffy and Xander move in. Xander tries 
      to hit Adam with his gun -- Adam swings it and Xander into a wall. Adam 
      and Buffy go hand to hand. It's clear that his strength is superior to 
      hers. She barely manages to stay on her feet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then Adam notices Angleman, who is trying to 
      make his way to the door. Adam casts Buffy off him - and is on Angleman 
      before she can react.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. 
      ANGLEMAN<br/>Doctor...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">In a flash, Adam's skewer is extended and 
      thrust through Angleman's head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Riley is back on his feet. He catches 
      Adam around the neck from behind with his utility wire. He tightens the 
      wire, cutting off Adam's air supply - but Adam reaches behind him, spins 
      Riley around to face him directly and without expression he SKEWERS RILEY 
      IN THE SIDE, piercing him through.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Fueled by rage, Buffy attacks Adam again and 
      he is forced to let Riley go. Riley falls to the ground hard, in bad 
      shape.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Again, Buffy and Adam go at it. This time, 
      however, Adam is winning from the gate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He hits Buffy again and again, each blow 
      more brutal than the last. Finally, she falls - landing next to Riley. 
      Adam is moving in for the kill when he's distracted by POUNDING ON THE 
      DOOR. He turns to Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>Thank you. This was 
      interesting.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He leaves off the fight and crawls back up 
      the catwalk. He disappears through the OPEN VENT he came 
      through.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON BUFFY AND RILEY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spared, but barely. Riley got the worst of 
      it by far. He's clearly suffering. Buffy moves to him, takes his 
      hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley. Are you 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But the commandos -- with Forrest and Graham 
      -- have entered.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You got a demon in here. It 
      escaped <br/>through that vent.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's not the Polgara. It kind 
      of looks <br/>like a man -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>(disbelieving)<br/>Right, and 
      you just happened to be<br/>in the neighborhood.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(with difficulty)<br/>She's 
      telling the truth. I saw it. It <br/>killed Angleman.<br/>(to the 
      men)<br/>Go. Now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A number of the men, save Graham, Forrest, 
      and a few others, take off after Adam. The strain of speaking seems to 
      have used the last bit of Riley's energy. He's passing out as Buffy lifts 
      him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>He needs a 
      hospital.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest moves forward, looking to Graham to 
      help him. They take Riley out of Buffy's arms, but Buffy continues to 
      grasp his hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>We'll take it from 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No. I'm going with him 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>It's a military hospital 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Back off. We take care of 
      our own<br/>around here, understand?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy stops as THREE ARMED RIFLES ARE AIMED 
      AT HER. The squad, all but Forrest and Graham, have her in their 
      sights.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Buffy...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He pulls her back. She reluctantly lets go 
      of Riley's hand. Riley stirs, feeling the connection severed. He can 
      barely speak.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Buffy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>(to Graham)<br/>Escort her

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Gun still trained - Graham moves forward, 
      takes Buffy's arm.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Let's go -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Just as Riley is taken out the door, he and 
      Buffy meet eyes - and it's clear that his animosity is gone and he wants 
      to go with her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No... Buffy -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy can barely stand her ground as Riley's

      war on the demon world.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(pained)<br/>War?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ROUGH-LOOKING DEMON<br/>With the slayer. 
      You kill other<br/>demons, and the rest of us don't<br/>hold with that. 
      Still, if I see you <br/>around here again I'll be inclined to<br/>break 
      that code. Do you understand?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike nods, painfully. The demon retreats 
      back into the bar, shutting the door as he goes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON SPIKE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As the light and the noise fade - and he 
      passes out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CAMPUS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Willow walk together, talking 
      intently among other students. Buffy's clearly worried, 
      desperate.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>...no word from 
      Riley?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Nothing. The Initiative 
      probably<br/>has him locked in a medical ward... <br/>And I can't get near 
      him - not until <br/>I have a better plan than storming <br/>in there and 
      getting us all shot.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yeah. You might want to work 
      the<br/>kinks out of that one.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What am I going to do? He 
      needs<br/>help - and I'm shut out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You'll find a 
      way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But it's not like I can spend 
      all my <br/>energy going after The Initiative <br/>now. Not while Adam's out 
      there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>He's that big a 
      threat?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy remembers, appears shaken as she 
      confesses -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I could barely fight him. It 
      sounded <br/>like Maggie designed him to be the <br/>ultimate warrior. He's 
      smart, and fast... <br/>He gave the commando guys the slip <br/>with no 
      problem.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(also shaken)<br/>There's got 
      to be a flaw...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'd say the part where he's 
      pure evil <br/>and kills randomly was an oversight...<br/>(overwhelmed)<br/>I 
      shouldn't have let them take Riley. <br/>I need to be with him. I need to 
      tell <br/>him I'm...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(not so sure)<br/>I'm sure 
      he's okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>How can he be? Everything he 
      ever<br/>believed has been taken away, or... <br/>He's all alone, Will. He 
      has nothing <br/>to hold on to...</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INTITIATIVE - HALLWAY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A dimly lit hallway in the medical unit, 
      deep in the heart of the complex. Doctors, nurses, etc... pass a ROOM WITH 
      AN ARMED GUARD AT THE DOOR.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INITIATIVE - HOSPITAL ROOM - 
      DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A small, dark room. A bed. A chair. It would 
      be overly kind to say it's an unwelcoming place.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON THE BED</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where RILEY HUDDLES. He lies on top of the 
      covers in his pants only, his bandaged chest exposed. He is still pale and 
      shivering. Wet from perspiration... He rocks, clutching something tightly 
      in his hands...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSER STILL</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Until we can see that it is <u>Buffy's
