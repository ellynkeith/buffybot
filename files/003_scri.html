<p>INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY 
      <p>GILES, deeply concerned, is staring at someone we can't see. 
      <p>WIDEN TO REVEAL BUFFY, in cute CHEERLEADING OUTFIT 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You don't like the color. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I what? I don't -- Buffy, do you<br/>ignore everything I say? 
      As a<br/>rule? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, I believe that's your trick. I<br/>told you I'm going out 
      for the<br/>cheerleading squad. 
      <p>GILES<br/>You have a sacred birthright,<br/>Buffy. You have been chosen 
      to<br/>destroy Vampires, not wave pom-poms<br/>at people. As the Watcher, 
      I<br/>forbid it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And you'll be stopping me how? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Dyeh, uh, well -- by appealling to<br/>your common sense, if 
      such a<br/>creature exists. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'll still have time to fight the<br/>forces of evil, okay? But 
      I want<br/>to have a life. I want to do<br/>something normal. Something 
      safe.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>

<p>INT. ATTIC - DAY 
      <p>The windows have been boarded and taped over -- tiny pinpricks of 
      sunlight stream in to this otherwise dark place. Whatever this place is, 
      it's not safe. 
      <p>A figure moves about before us in a black, hooded robe. It pauses 
      before a bubbling cauldron, then crosses to a shelf. 
      <p>On the shelf is a doll in a cheerleading outfit. Her hands have been 
      wrapped with bits of cloth. 
      <p>The figure reaches out and takes the doll. We HOLD on the empty shelf.

<p>INT. THE GYM - DAY 
      <p>CHEERLEADING TRYOUTS reads a sign on the wall. Big banner showing the 
      FIGHTING SUNNYDALE RAZORBACKS hangs next to it. 
      <p>PRETTY GIRLS, in short skirts, twirl and warm up. 
      <p>Buffy enters with WILLOW and XANDER. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Giles didn't approve, huh? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He totally lost his water. We<br/>haven't even seen a vampire 
      in a<br/>week. I'd say he should get a<br/>girlfriend if he wasn't so old. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well, we're behind you. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>People scoff at things like school<br/>spirit -- but when you 
      see these<br/>young women giving their all like<br/>this...</p></p></p></center>
<p>AMBER, an attractive, agile girl, her feet on two chairs, slides down 
      into an extra low split. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(mesmerized)<br/>...Oooh, stretchy. Where was I? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You were pretending that seeing<br/>scantily-clad girls in 
      revealing<br/>postures was a spiritual<br/>experience. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>What do you mean, pretending?</p></p></center>
<p>Xander pulls out an I.D. bracelet. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Oh, hey. Here's a little good luck<br/>thing for the 
      tryouts... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(charmed)<br/>What is this? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(less charmed)<br/>What is that?</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy takes the bracelet, puts it on. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>This is so sweet!<br/>(reads on bracelet:)<br/>"Yours 
      always..." 
      <p>XANDER<br/>That was on there when I got it.<br/>Really. They all said 
      that.</p></center>
<p>CORDELIA, in cheerleader outfit, moves up, watches Amber stand on one 
      leg and hold the other straight up in the air. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Just look at Amber. Who does she<br/>think she is, a 
      Laker Girl? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I heard she turned them down.</p></center>
<p>A SENIOR CHEERLEADER (Cordelia two years hence) moves to the judge's 
      table with two other SENIOR CHEERLEADERS. 
      <p>
<center>SENIOR CHEERLEADER<br/>Let's begin with...<br/>(reads from 
      list)<br/>Amber Grove. If you're not<br/>auditioning move off the 
      floor.</center>
<p>Xander, Willow, Buffy, Cordelia move back. Willow spots AMY MADISON (in 
      cheerleader outfit), nice girl, a little tightly wound today. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Hi Amy. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Hi. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I didn't know you wanted to be a<br/>cheerleader. You lost a 
      lot of<br/>weight. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Had to. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Do you know Buffy? 
      <p>AMY<br/>Hi.<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Oh how I hate this, let me count<br/>the 
      ways.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy smiles, warming to Amy's honesty. 
      <p>They watch Amber's routine -- she's really good. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>She trained with Benson -- he's the<br/>best coach money can 
      buy. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>They have cheerleading coaches? 
      <p>AMY<br/>Oh yeah. You don't have...? I train<br/>with my mom, three hours 
      in the<br/>morning, three at night. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That kind of quality time with my<br/>mom would probably lead 
      to some<br/>quality matricide. 
      <p>AMY<br/>(smiles)<br/>I know it's kinda hokey... but<br/>she's really 
      great.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Cordelia, standing nearby, feigns boredom with Amber's performance, 
      turns her back. 
      <p>Everyone else watches Amber as SMOKE BEGINS TO EMANATE from her 
      pom-poms. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What the ... ? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That girl's on fire. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(back still turned)<br/>Enough with the hyperbole.</p></p></center>
<p>Amber stops, drops the pom-poms. The smoke is coming from her - and her 
      hands and forearms suddenly burst into FLAMES! Amber SCREAMS! (as do other 
      girls.) Buffy vaults to the large RAZORBACKS BANNER, rips it down and 
      tackles Amber, wrapped her tightly in it and smothering the flames. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(to Amber)<br/>It's okay, you're gonna be okay...</center>
<p>Off Buffy,

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY 
      <p>The foursome are gathered. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I've been slaying Vampires for more<br/>than a year now. 
      I've seen some<br/>pretty cringeworthy stuff, but<br/>nobody's hands ever 
      got toasted. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I imagine not. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So this is not a vampire problem. 
      <p>GILES<br/>No. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But it is <b>funky</b>, right? Not of<br/>the norm? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Quite. Spontaneous human<br/>combustion is rare, 
      and<br/>scientifically unexplainable. But<br/>there've been cases reported 
      for<br/>hundreds of years. Usually all<br/>that's left is a pile of ashes. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That's all that would have been<br/>left of Amber if it hadn't 
      been for<br/>Buffy. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So we have no idea what caused<br/>this? That's a comfort. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, that is the thrill of living<br/>on a hellmouth -- one 
      has a<br/>veritable cornucopia of fiends,<br/>devils and ghouls to engage 
      --<br/>(off their looks)<br/>Pardon me for finding the glass<br/>half full. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Any common denominator in cases of<br/>spontaneous combustion? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Rage. In most cases the person who<br/>combusted was terribly 
      angry or<br/>upset. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So maybe Amber's got this power.<br/>To make herself be on 
      fire. Like<br/>the Human Torch, only it hurts. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So I should get the skinny on<br/>Amber. See if she's had 
      any<br/>colorful episodes before. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That means hacking illegally into<br/>the school's computer 
      system -- at<br/>last something I can do.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She moves to a computer. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>I'll ask around about her. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Guys, you don't have to get<br/>involved. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>What do you mean? We're a team!<br/>Aren't we a team? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah, you're the Slayer and we're<br/>like the slayerettes. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't want you putting yourselves<br/>in danger. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I laugh in the face of danger.<br/>Then I hide till it goes 
      away. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay, well, I'm psyched for the<br/>help.<br/>(to Giles)<br/>And 
      what if we find out Amber<br/>didn't cause this herself? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Then we will have to determine who<br/>or what did. And deal 
      with it<br/>accordingly. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(off Buffy's worried<br/>look)<br/>Hey, we've fought 
      vampires!<br/>Anything else'll be a walk in the<br/>park. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I hope so... </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>

<p>INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 
      <p>There are crates strewn about. Joyce is opening them with a crowbar 
      (and some difficulty). 
      <p>Buffy enters, throws her books on the kitchen table. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hey, Mom. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Hi. How was school? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>A reverent joy. What's all this? 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>It's for the tribal art display.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy picks up a statue, looks at it. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh. Cool.</center>
<p>She sits down on the table, grabbing a donut. Watches Joyce a minute -- 
      Joyce hasn't looked back at her -- before offering: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>We had tryouts today. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Great! How'd it go? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, I didn't get to try out yet.<br/>There was an accident. 
      Pretty fierce<br/>competition, though. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>I know you'll do fine. Keep on<br/>plugging. Just have to get 
      back on<br/>the horse.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Joyce tries to pry open the crate on the table next to Buffy. It won't 
      budge. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Mom? 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>(finally looking around)<br/>Yeah? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What was I trying out for? 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>(stops, stumped)<br/>Um... some activity? I have no<br/>idea, 
      I'm sorry. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's okay. Your platitudes are<br/>good for all occasions. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>I'm distracted. I've got a lot of<br/>inventory to go through 
      here. This<br/>is my gallery's first major show.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She gives up, turns to another crate. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>It might not physically kill you to<br/>give me a 
      hand...</center>
<p>Buffy casually flips the lid off the unopenable crate with one hand. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>It was cheerleading tryouts. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Oh! Good. I'm glad you're taking<br/>that up again. Keep you 
      out of<br/>trouble. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm not in trouble, mom. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>No, not yet. I mean -- you stopped<br/>cheerleading right 
      before the<br/>trouble. So it's good you're going<br/>back --</p></p></p></center>
<p>She pulls a statue of a man halfway out of a crate, stops. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Oh, dear.</center>
<p>She puts it back. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What is it? 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Fertility statue. You don't need<br/>to see it.</p></center>
<p>Buffy heads for the fridge. Looking in: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You know, this girl Amy trains with<br/>her mom like three 
      hours a day.<br/>(closes the fridge)<br/>Sounds like her mom's really 
      into<br/>it. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>(Absently)<br/>Sounds like her mom doesn't have a<br/>whole lot 
      to do.</p></center>
<p>She exits, carrying a couple of pieces. Buffy watches her a moment, 
      then looks down into the crate with the fertility statue. Her eyes go 
      wide. 
      <p>

<p>EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY - ESTABLISHING 
      <p>
<center>SENIOR CHEERLEADER (O.S.)<br/>Despite the terrible thing 
      that<br/>happened yesterday...</center>
<p>INT. THE GYM - DAY 
      <p>Cheerleader tryouts. Buffy, Amy, Cordelia (wearing pink headband) and 
      ten or twelve others. 
      <p>
<center>SENIOR CHEERLEADER<br/>...we still have to pick 
      new<br/>cheerleaders. If you make the team,<br/>you'll find your name posted 
      in the<br/>Quad after lunch. Let's begin with<br/>group performance -- 
      Cordelia,<br/>Buffy, Amy, Morgan, Janice and<br/>Lishanne.</center>
<p>LISHANNE is an attractive African American. The five girls walk to the 
      center of the gym. Amy glares at her hands. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Why do my hands have to sweat when<br/>I get nervous? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Don't worry, you'll do great. </p></center>
<p>MUSIC UP. The girls perform a group cheer (to be choreographed.) 
      <p>It includes synchronized leaps, twirls and basketball cheer, ala: 
      <p>
<center>LISHANNE<br/>We're Sunnydale, Sunnydale 
      <p>GROUP CHEER<br/>We Never Fail, Never Fail 
      <p>LISHANNE<br/>Jump and Shoot, Swish and Score 
      <p>GROUP CHEER<br/>The Other Team Is Such a Bore<br/>YEAHHH!</p></p></p></center>
<p>Morgan is okay. Lishanne is great. Cordelia is surprisingly good, as is 
      Buffy, still a little rusty but impressive. 
      <p>Amy starts out well but tries too hard -- misses a couple of 
      synchronized moves -- and, in the big finish (each girl doing a cartwheel 
      and sliding to their knees one at a time) AMY'S HANDS slip on the floor, 
      and she careens into: 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>(to judges)<br/>You saw that, right? That 
      wasn't<br/>me.</center>

<p>INT. GYM FOYER - MOMENTS LATER 
      <p>Amy, in cheerleader outfit, depressed, stands before a big trophy 
      display case (includes cheerleader trophies and photos). 
      <p>Buffy, dressed for school, exits locker room, moves up. Looks at 
      CHEERLEADER PHOTO. Under the photo, it reads: 1977 -- TRI-COUNTY BEST. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>That's my mom. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No...<br/>(reads name)<br/>Catherine Madison. Get down 
      with<br/>your bad self. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Her nickname was Catherine The<br/>Great: she took that team and 
      made<br/>them tri-county champions, no one's<br/>ever done that before or 
      since. She<br/>and my dad were homecoming King and<br/>Queen, got married 
      right after<br/>graduation. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's kinda romantic. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Well... he was a big loser,<br/>couldn't make any money, took 
      off<br/>with Miss Trailer Trash when I was<br/>twelve. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay, that part's less romantic.<br/>My folks split up, too. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Drag, huh. He left my mom with<br/>nothing. She put herself 
      through<br/>cosmetology school, bought me<br/>everything I ever wanted and 
      never<br/>gained a single pound... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>She sounds great, Amy, but that<br/>doesn't mean you have to, 
      you know,<br/>lock step as far as the<br/>cheerleading thing --</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Amy turns to Buffy, eyes filling. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>It's just, she was the best, and I<br/>can't get my body to 
      <u>move</u> like<br/>hers. I choked in there so bad.</center>
<p>Amy looks very sad and forlorn as Willow enters. She tries to put on a 
      brave face, heads for the GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>...I gotta get changed... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(to Amy's departing back)<br/>Hi Amy...<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>She 
      okay? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>She's wiggin' about her mother...<br/>(re: photo)<br/>...the big 
      cheer queen back when. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah. Her mom's kinda... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Nazi-like? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Heil. If she gains an ounce she<br/>padlocks the fridge and 
      won't eat<br/>anything but broth. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So Mommie Dearest is really...<br/>Mommie Dearest. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>There's a bitter streak -- but<br/>Amy's nice. We used to hang 
      in<br/>Junior High. When her mom'd go on a<br/>broth kick Amy'd come to my 
      house<br/>and we'd just stuff ourselves with<br/>brownies. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Any word on Amber? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(pulls paper from<br/>bookbag)<br/>Nothing thrilling. Average 
      student<br/>-- got detention once for<br/>smoking -- regular smoking, with 
      a<br/>cigarette. Not being smoky. All<br/>pretty normal. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We'll just have to see what happens<br/>next. Maybe nothing 
      will.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>

<p>INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY 
      <p>MOVING CREEPY-CAM through the dimly lit room. Past the cold floors, the 
      metal lockers... 
      <p>Amy, alone, changes into her school clothes. Her movements are slow and 
      tired. She rubs an aching shoulder -- hears a NOISE, whips her head 
      around. HER POV - The empty locker room. Spooky. A lone shower DRIPS. 
      <p>She instinctively does up a couple of buttons on her blouse, as if to 
      protect herself, turning slowly around in a circle -- and suddenly 
      <p>CORDELIA IS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO HER 
      <p>Amy jumps, frightened. Cordelia is perfectly dressed and coiffed. She 
      holds the pink headband she wore during auditions. She speaks very quietly 
      and in a chillingly kind voice, gesturing very close to Amy's face with 
      the headband. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>I have a dream. It's me on the<br/>Cheerleading Squad, 
      adored by every<br/>Varsity male as far as the eye can<br/>see. We have to 
      achieve our dreams,<br/>Amy, otherwise we wither and die.

      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Shhh. If your supreme klutziness<br/>out there today takes 
      me out of the<br/>running you are going to be so very<br/>beyond sorry. Have 
      a nice day. </p></p></center>
<p>Cordelia hurls the headband into her own locker and SLAMS IT! She walks 
      out -- her locker swinging back open. Amy takes a breath, watching 
      Cordelia's departing back.

<p>EXT. QUAD DAY 
      <p>Kids mill about after lunch. Xander and Willow walk through them. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I told Buffy about Amber. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Cool. Was she wearing it?<br/>(off her look)<br/>The bracelet. 
      She was wearing it,<br/>right? That's pretty much like<br/>we're going out. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Except without the hugging or<br/>kissing or her knowing about 
      it. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So now I'm a figure of fun. I<br/>should just ask, right? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Won't know till you ask. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>See, this is why you're cool.<br/>You're like a guy. You're my 
      guy<br/>friend that knows about girl stuff. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh great. I'm a guy. </p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He sees the Senior Cheerleader moving towards the bulletin board, list 
      in hand. Girls begin to gather. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Hey, they're posting the list! </center>
<p>He bolts for: 
      <p>EXT. QUAD - BULLETIN BOARD - DAY 
      <p>A sizable crowd has gathered. The Senior Cheerleader posts the list and 
      goes. Girls stand on tiptoe, push and poke, trying to see. Buffy and Amy 
      are on the periphery as Xander and Willow move up. A GIRL IN TEARS breaks 
      out of the crowd, runs off. Lishanne, reading the list, jumps up and down 
      with some friends. 
      <p>
<center>LISHANNE<br/>Yess! 
      <p>AMY<br/>I can't take this... </p></center>
<p>Buffy tries to wedge into the crowd but TWO CONTENDERS step right in 
      front of her. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Spot me, I'm goin' in. </center>
<p>Xander takes a little dive into the throng, works his way to the front 
      where he finds himself nose to nose with Cordelia at the list. He lets her 
      check it out first. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Women and children first. </center>
<p>ANGLE - EDGE OF THRONG 
      <p>Cordelia emerges, triumphant. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>(to Amy)<br/>You're lucky. 
      <p>AMY<br/>I made it? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/><u>I</u> made it. </p></p></center>
<p>Cordelia moves off; Xander, rubbing his arm, emerges from the throng. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>One of those girls hit me really<br/>hard -- we have to 
      start testing<br/>for steroids --<br/>(to Buffy and Amy)<br/>-- okay, not 
      only did you make it,<br/>but you, Miss Summers, are the<br/>number one 
      alternate and Amy's the<br/>number three! </center>
<p>Amy's face falls, she turns and walks off. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Any what better way to celebrate<br/>than with a romantic 
      drive-through<br/>for two at -- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Xander, alternates are the ones who<br/>didn't make the team. 
      They only<br/>fill in if something happens to the<br/>ones who did. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(moving after Amy)<br/>Excuse me. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>For I am Xander, King of the<br/>Cretins, and all lesser 
      cretins<br/>must bow before me. </p></p></p></center>
<p>ANGLE - AMY, TRYING TO CONTROL HER FEELINGS 
      <p>As Buffy moves up. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>At least it's over. And you know<br/>what I think we 
      should do about it?<br/>Brownie pig-out, my house, now. 
      <p>AMY<br/>How many more hours a day can I<br/>practice? How much more can I 
      do?<br/>This would never have happened to<br/>my mom. Never. </p></center>
<p>Amy takes off. Buffy watches her go. 
      <p>EXT. AMY'S HOUSE - DAY 
      <p>A Sunnydale two story, a little darker and foreboding than the others 
      on the street. WE PUSH in on the house, moving up towards the attic 
      window. 
      <p>INT. AMY'S ATTIC - DAY 
      <p>Creepy, dark and strange. Walls adorned with witch and warlock 
      paraphernalia. Burning black candles. 
      <p>The floor is dominated by a large hand-painted pentagram on top of 
      which sits the classic black iron cauldron, hideous bubbling brew cooking 
      inside. 
      <p>A HAND ENTERS FRAME drops a serpent's head into the brew. We don't see 
      the robed WITCH'S face but we (dimly) HEAR HER CHANTING. 
      <p>
<center>WITCH<br/>...Lord of Darkness, Lord of<br/>Night... accept they 
      supplicant's<br/>sacrifice... </center>
<p>The Witch moves to a ROW OF DOLLS neatly lined up on the wall. Pretty 
      dolls, Barbie-types. 
      <p>The hand picks up a brunette doll. The hand brings the doll to the 
      cauldron. We now see CORDELIA'S PINK HEAD BAND in the Witch's other hand. 
      The CHANTING grows more intense as the pink headband is wrapped round and 
      round the Cordelia doll's face, tighter and tighter. 
      <p>
<center>WITCH<br/>...reap thy vengeance with keen and<br/>cruel might... 
      send thy sudden<br/>darkness out of darkest night. </center>
<p>And the hand drops the Cordelia doll in the brew. The pink headband 
      soaks up the foul-colored liquid and the little doll sinks from sight.

      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Look what I found! It's my old<br/>yearbook, from junior 
      year. Oh,<br/>look, there I am. </center>
<p>Buffy looks for a second. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Mom, I accepted that you've had<br/>sex. I'm not ready to 
      know you've<br/>had Farrah hair. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>This is Gidget hair. Don't they<br/>teach you anything in 
      history? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's cool. I gotta book -- 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Well I was thinking, I mean I know<br/>the cheerleading thing 
      didn't work<br/>out. Maybe you should think about<br/>joining the yearbook 
      staff. I did<br/>it, and it was a lot of fun. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Not really my tip, mom. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>I was photo editor. I got to be on<br/>every page. Made me look 
      much more<br/>popular than I was. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Have you seen the kids who do<br/>yearbook, mom? <b>Nerds</b> 
      pick on<br/>them. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Some of the best times I had in<br/>school were working on 
      the<br/>yearbook. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>This just in: I'm not you. I'm<br/>into my own thing. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Your own thing, whatever it is, got<br/>you kicked out of 
      school. And we<br/>had to move here to find a decent<br/>school that would 
      take you. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Quite frankly, ouch. The sting hangs in the air before Buffy grabs her 
      books and walks out. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Honey... </center>
<p>Joyce stands there a moment, upset with herself.

      noon as usual?<br/>(to Willow, re:<br/>Cordelia's

      mammal, much less a human<br/>being? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>None. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>This invisible man syndrome, a<br/>blessing in Cordelia's 
      case, a<br/>curse in Buffy's. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You're not invisible to Buffy. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Worse, I'm just part of the<br/>scenery, like an old shoe, or 
      a rug<br/>you walk on every day but you never<br/>really see -- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(trying to be helpful)<br/>-- like a pen that's all chewed 
      up<br/>and you know you should throw it<br/>away but you don't, not 'cause 
      you<br/>really like it that much but more<br/>'cause you're just so used to 
      it<br/>and -- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Will. That is the point and let's<br/>not drive it through my

      trash) 
      <p>XANDER<br/>What I have to do -- what I'm going<br/>to do -- is be a 
      <u>man</u> and ask her<br/>out. No more i.d. bracelets, subtle<br/>innuendo, 
      or Polaroids outside her<br/>bedroom window late at night --<br/>that last 
      is a joke to relieve the<br/>tension because <u>here she comes</u>.

<p>Buffy rounds a corner, heading their way. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I know I'm relieved. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Alright. Into battle I go. would<br/>you ask her out for me? 
      No. Man.<br/>Me. Battle. </p></center>
<p>ANGLE - BUFFY 
      <p>Passing Cordelia at her locker. Buffy sees Cordelia reach for her 
      combination -- her fingers miss it, find it. Buffy moves on, is 
      intercepted by:

      later, you don't<br/>mind, do you? </center>

      builds slowly in the back of his throat -- the sound of a plan going down,

      concerned. 
      <p>EXT. DRIVER'S ED - DAY 
      <p>Orange cones are set up in a little course on the blacktop. A DRIVER'S 
      ED car, MR. POLE, the beleaguered TEACHER, two STUDENTS. Cordelia walks

<p>Cordelia slams on the brakes, jams the car through every gear until she

      <p>The car SCREECHES forward.

<p>Cordelia does as she's told, yanking the wheel, stomping on the brakes. 

      <p>Cordelia's car launches into a nasty skid, right off the blacktop, onto 
      the grass, careening out of control now <u>towards the street</u>.

      <p>Mr. Pole and the KIDS IN BACK SCREAM bloody murder. 
      <p>EXT. STREET - DAY 
      <p>Cordelia's car skids into the street and stops. A car swerves around 
      them, tires squealing, HORN BLARING. 
      <p>
<center>MR. POLE<br/>Everyone out! </center>
<p>Cordelia, Pole, the students scramble out. Mr. Pole and the students 
      run. Cordelia looks around, completely disoriented.

      <p>Dark and murky, dimmest shape of a UPS size <b>truck bearing down on

<p>ANGLE - Buffy, Xander, Willow. Giles holds a witchcraft text. We see AN 
      ENGRAVING of SCARY WITCHES in SACRED CIRCLE in the woods.

      still afford a house<br/>in Sunnydale.

      <p>WILLOW<br/>Maybe because... they met her. Did<br/>I say that? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Then why was Amber set ablaze? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yeah, those guys don't hang. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>They're both cheerleaders.

      <p>BUFFY<br/>She's desperate to get on that<br/>team... I get the feeling 
      she'd do<br/>anything to make her mom's dream<br/>come true. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Now I do want to make sure I've got<br/>this right. This witch 
      is casting<br/>horrible, disfiguring spells so<br/>that she can be a 
      cheerleader. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Your point being? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Priorities. Really, if I had the<br/>power of the black mass 
      I'd set my<br/>sights a little higher than making<br/>the pep squad. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I think you're underestimating the<br/>amount of pressure a 
      parent can lay<br/>on you. If you're not a picture<br/>perfect carbon copy 
      they tend to<br/>wig. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Cheerleading was kind of her mom's<br/>last hurrah. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>We still gotta stop Amy. We should<br/>grab her before --

      ugly<br/>things. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>All right, you're a high school<br/>girl, you're desperate to 
      make the<br/>team and please your mom, you turn<br/>to witchcraft. What's

      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>I can't. </center>
<p>He puts the scalpel down. Willow takes it, makes (off camera) a quick 
      neat incision. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>One eye of newt... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Wow, you've got a killer streak<br/>I've never seen before. 
      Hope I<br/>never cross you. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I do too, then I'd have to carve<br/>you up in neat little 
      pieces. </p></p></center>
<p>She holds up the scalpel, gives him her sweet "Willow" smile.

      coming with the hair? </center>

<center>LISHANNE<br/>(sarcastically)<br/>Isn't this exciting? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(small laugh)<br/>Oh yeah. </p></center>
<p>Buffy reaches Amy at another big desk with Bunsen burner, beakers, etc. 

      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Help. Which is the hydrochloric<br/>acid and which is the 
      ammonium<br/>hydroxide? 
      <p>AMY<br/>Well, the bottle that says<br/>hydrochloric acid is usually 
      the<br/>hydrochloric acid. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Read the bottles -- what a concept. </p></p></center>
<p>Buffy drops her pen, bends down to pick it up, as she does, her hand 
      slips INSIDE AMY'S purse, grabs some hair off Amy's brush. 
      <p>ANGLE - BUFFY STRAIGHTENS UP 
      <p>Amy's looking at her -- did she see the hair grab? 
      <p>Buffy moves back to her seat (in front of Willow and Xander.) Keeping 
      her back to them, she reaches back, drops the hair in front of Willow who 
      adds it to a chemical mix on a Bunsen burner. 
      <p>Amy glances at them. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(through his teeth)<br/>Smile and wave to the nice witch. 
      </center>
<p>Willow hands the beaker to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>All set. You have a plan? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spill it on her, try and make it<br/>look natural. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>We'll be right behind you. Only<br/>farther away. </p></p></center>
<p>Buffy heads for Amy's desk with beaker. As she does, 
      <p>
<center>DR. GREGORY<br/>Lishanne, can you tell me why these<br/>chemicals 
      have this reaction? </center>
<p>Buffy casually spills a drops or two on Amy's arm. Buffy looks at: 
      <p>ANGLE - AMY'S ARM 
      <p>The drops do turn blue, but we tilt up to see Amy's eyes locked on 
      someone else. 
      <p>ANGLE - LISHANNE 
      <p>We see her from behind, starting to shake, to spaz out. 
      <p>
<center>DR. GREGORY<br/>Lishanne? Are you -- Oh my god. </center>
<p>She knocks a few beakers over as she stumblingly rises and turns, 
      grabbing at the first thing she sees -- which is Amy. Amy is brought face 
      to face with Lishanne -- WHO HAS NO MOUTH. Amy backs away, terrified by 
      what she sees.

<p>Amy finds her mother, CATHERINE MADISON, late thirties, very well

      <p>WILLOW<br/>And if we can't get our hands on<br/>it?

<center>GILES<br/>Collect those dolls, and all the<br/>personal -- </center>
<p>something LEAPS at him from the trunk, SCREECHING -- a black cat. Giles 
      jumps back as the cat hits the floor and takes off out of the room. 
      <p>Giles takes a moment to recover himself. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Nice kitty...<br/>(looking in the trunk)<br/>What were you 
      guarding? Yes... </center>
<p>He pulls out the book. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>This is it. </center>
<p>INT. AMY'S LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER 
      <p>Giles comes back down with the book, Catherine with the box of 
      talismans. 
      <p>Buffy is back on the couch. She looks ghastly, but she looks up to 
      Giles with hope. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Did we find? 
      <p>GILES<br/>We found. </p></center>
<p>He gently helps her to her feet. He hands the book to Catherine and 
      picks Buffy up. 
      <p>
<center>CATHERINE<br/>Where are you going? 
      <p>GILES<br/>We're going to school. And you're<br/>coming with us. </p></center>

<p>INT. THE GYM - EVENING 
      <p>We hear students CHEERING as the school basketball team takes the 
      floor. 
      <p>The camera is in steady motion, following the team, sweeping across the 
      stands, racing by the cheerleaders. The last one is Amy. 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. SCIENCE LAB - EVENING 
      <p>They enter, Giles placing Buffy in a chair as Catherine drops the box 
      on a table. He squats before Buffy, looks her in the eyes. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I'm going to stop this. </center>
<p>ANGLE: BUFFY'S POV 
      <p>the figure of Giles is a colorful BLUR. The room seems to teeter and 
      shift around him, his VOICE a bizarre and deep echo. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I promise. Just hang on. </center>
<p>He stands up (we are no longer in her POV), digs in the box for the 
      book. 
      <p>
<center>CATHERINE<br/>How is she? 
      <p>GILES<br/>We only have a few minutes. </p></center>
<p>Giles pulls the book out of the box, starts looking through it. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Let's see... I'll need lead,<br/>sulphur, some sort of 
      diacetate... </center>
<p>He goes over to the glass cabinet with the chemicals in it. It's 
      locked. Casually, still looking down at the book for reference, he picks 
      up a metal beaker and smashes the glass. He looks in and starts picking 
      out vials of useful substances. 
      <p>
<center>CATHERINE<br/>What should I do? </center>
<p>He turns to her. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Find me a frog. </center>

<p>INT. THE GYM - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>The game has started, the kids in the stands CHEERING. The cheerleaders 
      are on the sideline, doing steps. 
      <p>ANGLE: AMY 
      <p>Is right there with them, last on the left. She is beaming. 
      <p>ANGLE: THE CROWD - AMY'S POV 
      <p>They are a ROARING mass, an appreciative audience. A joyful noise. 
      <p>And she moves in SLOW MOTION, the camera circling LOW around her, as 
      she relives her greatest glory. 
      <p>ANGLE: THE STANDS 
      <p>The camera whips across the fans to find Xander and Willow up off to 
      the side. 
      <p>They alone are silent, their eyes never leaving Amy.

<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. SCIENCE LAB - A BIT LATER 
      <p>Giles has something bubbling in a beaker, a Bunsen burner under it. 
      <p>Catherine is nearby, reluctantly prying out a dead frog's eyes. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Right. </center>
<p>He throws in a powder, and begins: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>(reading)<br/>The center is dark.<br/>(in 
      Latin)<br/><u>centrum est obscurus</u>.<br/>(reading)<br/>The darkness 
      breathes.<br/>(in Latin)<br/><u>tenebrae respiratis</u>.<br/>(reading)<br/>The

<center>GILES<br/>Hear me. </center>

      <p>Amy is still strutting in step, still basking in her glory.

      <p>The appreciative crowd is before us, and then suddenly it becomes 
      <p>ANGLE: CATHERINE'S POV 
      <p>the lab. A table. A frog. 
      <p>It's just a flash, and then it's the audience again. Amy starts, wide 
      eyed, and nearly messes up. 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Catherine is reeling just as Amy was, shaking off the momentary change.

      <p>GILES<br/>(reading)<br/>Unlock the gate, let the darkness<br/>shine. Cover 
      us with holy fear.<br/>Show me. </p></center>
<p>He barks the order again, "show me", but this time in Arabic (<u>waar

      <p>The cheerleaders are forming a pyramid, Amy at the top. She is up there 
      when: 
      <p>ANGLE: CATHERINE'S POV 
      <p>flashes before us again. This time it's clearer; we can see Giles, and 
      the whole room. Our gaze sweeps over to include the dying Buffy. 
      <p>Amy SCREAMS -- and falls, wrecking the whole pyramid. The girls tumble 
      about, the fans LAUGHING a bit. 
      <p>
<center>SENIOR CHEERLEADER<br/>Amy, what's your problem? </center>
<p>Amy stands, primal fury on her face. The cheerleader backs off. 
      <p> </p>
<p>Amy RUNS out of the gym. 
      <p>ANGLE: XANDER AND WILLOW 
      <p>They see her go.

      His voice is not even human to her anymore. 
      <p>ANGLE: CATHERINE 
      <p>She is still reeling from the flashes. She looks up suddenly.

<center>WILLOW<br/>Amy! 
      <p>AMY<br/>Get out of my way! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Wait! I needed to talk to you. I<br/>can help you. </p></p></center>
<p>The look Amy gives her raises one's hair. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Help me? With what? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well, you know, all your...<br/>witchcraft. I know a 
      really<br/>good... cauldron... do you actually<br/>ride a broom or -- 
      </p></center>
<p>Xander is sneaking up behind Amy. She SPINS suddenly and glares at him. 
      She mutters something under her breath and he stops, suddenly unable to 
      breathe. Drops to his knees. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Xander! </center>
<p>Amy turns and PUNCHES Willow, knocks her to the ground.

      dark, release<br/>the unworthy... Take of mine<br/>energy and be sated!

<p>INT. HALL OUTSIDE LAB - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Amy arrives, tries the door. 
      <p>Catherine sees the door rattle, startles back in terror 
      <p>ANGLE: AMY 
      <p>Smashes the emergency glass and pulls out an axe. 
      <p>ANGLE: GILES 
      <p>Pulls his dripping hands out. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Be sated! Release the unworthy! </center>

      <p>hits the door, burying itself above the lock. 
      <p>ANGLE: GILES 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Release! </center>
<p>ANGLE: BUFFY 
      <p>Her eyes flutter shut, her head slumping over. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Release! </center>
<p>INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>And the door BURSTS OPEN, An axe wielding Amy running in. She takes one 
      quick look around, heads for Buffy -- 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>RELEASE! </center>
<p>Amy raises the axe -- there is a flash of light --<br/>--and she stops. 
      Lowers it as 
      <p>ANGLE: BUFFY 
      <p>stands, completely restored. She and Amy look at each other in wonder. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Amy? </center>
<p>And Catherine FLIES into frame, SCREAMING and tackling Buffy. The woman 
      has gone completely apeshit. Giles comes at her and she just LOOKS up at 
      him -- 
      <p>-- and a desk MOVES at him, knocking him down. 
      <p>Catherine stands, comes toward the cowering Amy. Nothing but hate in 
      her gaze. 
      <p>
<center>CATHERINE<br/>You. You little brat. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Mom, please... </p></center>
<p>She is retreating, raising the axe more for protection than anything 
      else. Catherine merely cocks her head and the axe FLIES out of Amy's hand 
      and into her own. Amy stifles a scream. 
      <p>
<center>CATHERINE<br/>Raise a hand to your own mother?<br/>Who gave you 
      birth, who gave up her<br/>life, her LIFE so you could drag<br/>your 
      worthless carcass around and<br/>call it living? </center>
<p>She SLAMS the axe into a table top. 
      <p>Amy looks from the axe to her mother. 
      <p>ANGLE: CATHERINE'S HANDS 
      <p>Something is happening -- energy begins emanating from them -- like 
      sparks, only black. Something very powerful is brewing in her. 
      <p>
<center>CATHERINE<br/>You were never anything but<br/>trouble. I'll put you 
      where you'll<br/>never make trouble again. </center>
<p>Buffy appears right behind Catherine. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hey, guess what? </center>
<p>Catherine turns. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I feel better. </center>
<p>ANGLE: Catherine flies over a table, hits the ground with all attendant 
      smashing of glass things. 
      <p>Buffy comes around the table and Catherine pops back up, wired with 
      fury. 
      <p>
<center>CATHERINE<br/>That body was mine! Mine! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh, grow up. </p></center>
<p>Catherine throws her head back in a mystical shriek --- and Buffy is 
      flung back over the teacher's desk. She rises to see Catherine shaking, 
      about to cast the spell. 
      <p>
<center>CATHERINE<br/>I shall look upon my enemy -- </center>
<p>Her arms CRACKLE with energy -- she opens her eyes and they are glowing 
      darkly- she throws her arms forward with the final phrase -- 
      <p>
<center>CATHERINE<br/>-- I shall look upon her and the<br/>dark place will 
      have her soul!<br/>Corsheth! Take her! </center>
<p>And Buffy SWINGS her leg over the table and BREAKS the support for the 
      mirror above -- it comes down, hitting the table at an angle, still 
      supported on the other side. 
      <p>It's too late for Catherine to stop. The spell shoots out of her arms 
      at her own reflection. It bounces right back at her. 
      <p>She SCREAMS. Glows. Energy singing around her, wrapping her up. 
      <p>Then there's nothing. 
      <p>Giles, no longer pinned, gets up, creeps forward with Amy. Buffy comes 
      from behind the desk. They all look around them, but they are alone. After 
      a while... 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Well, that was interesting. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Are you guys okay? 
      <p>AMY<br/>(feelingly)<br/>I'm fine. </p></p></center>
<p>Buffy smiles at her. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I think all the spells were<br/>reversed. Of course, it's 
      my first<br/>casting, I may have got it wrong. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You save my life. You were a god. 
      <p>GILES<br/>One doesn't want to be immodest,<br/>but I am not unsatisfied 
      -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Giles, stop being so proper.<br/>You're in America. Brag. 
      </p></p></p></center>
<p>And they head for the door, Giles obliging: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Well, it was the first time and some of<br/>those 
      incantations are quite<br/>tricky. And I was somewhat<br/>interpretive with 
      the<br/>ingredients -- </center>
<p>A FIGURE LEAPS OUT at Amy, tackles her. 
      <p>It's Xander. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>I got her! I got her! Cut her<br/>head off! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Xander, what are you doing? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Saving you. </p></p></center>
<p>Buffy pulls him off Amy. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>But she's evil! 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, it wasn't exactly her. 
      <p>AMY<br/>It was my mom. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Oh. </p></p></p></center>
<p>It takes a moment for him to realize he has no idea what they're 
      talking about. Willow runs in now, carrying a baseball bat. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Where is she? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Willow! It's cool. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It is? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Oh yeah. I took care of it. </p></p></p></center>

      <p>JOYCE<br/>I've been thinking a lot about<br/>where you're coming from, 
      how to<br/>relate to you, and I've come to a<br/>simple conclusion. I don't 
      get it.<br/>What you want, what you're<br/>thinking. Not a clue. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm inscrutable, huh? 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>You're sixteen. I think there's a<br/>biological imperative 
      whereby I<br/>can't understand you because I'm<br/>not sixteen. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Do you ever wish you could be?<br/>Sixteen again? 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>There's a frightful notion. Go<br/>through all that 
      again.<br/>(shudders)<br/>No even if it helped me understand<br/>you.

<p>Buffy kisses her on the cheek --

      anywhere, wants<br/>to spend total quality time<br/>together.<br/>I'm like, 
      "Dad, I can go out, it's<br/>perfectly safe." He's got all this<br/>guilt at 
      leaving me with mom and<br/>he's being a total pain. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're loving it. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Every single minute. </p></p></center>
<p>Cordelia breezes by with the other cheerleaders as they get out of the 
      gym. We see Amber and Lishanne -- all recovered. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Hey, I'm really sorry you guys got<br/>bumped back to 
      alternate. Hold<br/>it -- wait -- no I'm not. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Well, I know I'll miss the<br/>intellectual thrill of 
      spelling<br/>words out with my arms. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Ooh, these grapes are sour. </p></p></center>
<p>She exits, passing Buffy, who is staring at the trophy case. Amy looks 
      to her, the smile leaving her face. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you<br/>actually wanted to be on the 
      squad. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, that's okay. Cheerleading is<br/>just a little too hairy 
      these days. 
      <p>AMY<br/>That's for sure. </p></p></center>
<p>For a moment they both look at Catherine's trophy. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Catherine the Great. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And there's been no sign of her? 
      <p>AMY<br/>That last spell, she said I'd never<br/>make trouble again. 
      Wherever she<br/>is, I don't think we have to worry. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Twisted. 
      <p>AMY<br/>I'm just happy to have my body<br/>back.<br/>(as they walk 
      off)<br/>I'm thinking of getting fat. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, that look is in for spring. </p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>As they leave, we stay on the trophy. TRACK in closer to the 
      cheerleading figure on top. And closer, to the impassive bronze face.
