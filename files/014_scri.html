<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT CLOSE ON: A HEADSTONE 
      <p>The engraved rock tells us that STEPHAN KORSHAK died within the last 
      couple of days and now rests below. 
      <p>Then, a YO-YO DROPS DOWN INTO FRAME in front of the death stone, spins, 
      then reels BACK UP AND OUT OF FRAME. 
      <p>A beat, then the YO-YO RETURNS. This time, WE GO BACK UP WITH IT to 
      BUFFY, atop the tombstone, keeping a bored vigil with the stringed toy in 
      one hand and a stake in the other. 
      <p>BEHIND HER, ANGEL approaches through the cemetery, UNNOTICED. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(to the grave below) <br/>Come on, Stephan, rise and 
      shine. <br/>Some of us have a ton of trig <br/>homework waiting. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Hey--</p></center>
<p>Caught off guard, Buffy SPINS, startled. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Ack! 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Is this a bad time? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(steps off the stone) <br/>Are you crazy? You don't just sneak 
      <br/>up on people in a graveyard. You make<br/>noise when you walk. You... 
      <br/>stomp, or... yodel. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>I heard you were on the hunt. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Supposed to be. But lazybones here <br/>doesn't wanna come out 
      and play. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>When you first wake up, it's a little <br/>disorienting. He'll 
      show. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's weird to think of you going<br/>through that. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>It's weird to go through. You're <br/>here alone? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, why? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>I just thought you'd have somebody<br/>with you... Xander or 
      someone. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Xander? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Or someone. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, no Xander. Why, are you jealous? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Of Xander? Please. He's just a kid. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Is it 'cause I danced with him? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>"Danced with" is a pretty loose term.<br/>"Mated with" might be 
      a little closer -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh, you're shocking! One little<br/>dance and you know I just 
      did it to<br/>make you crazy which by the way<br/>behold my success! 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>I am not jealous!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Neither of them notice as they argue that Stephan starts crawling out 
      of his grave, looking at them with ravenous glee. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh, you're not jealous. What,<br/>vampires don't get 
      jealous? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>See? Whenever we fight, you always<br/>bring up the vampire 
      thing. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I didn't come here to fight.</p></p></center>
<p>Stephan leaps on her, knocking her to the ground. She throws him off. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Oh, right. I did.<br/>(looks around,<br/>getting 
      up)<br/>Where's my stake?<br/>(to Angel)<br/>What'd you do with my stake? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>(looking around)<br/>I didn't touch your stake...</p></center>
<p>ANGLE: STEPHAN 
      <p>He grabs a shovel. Grins. 
      <p>Angel charges him and he WHACKS him in the head. Angel flies back, 
      lands hard as Buffy moves in -- 
      <p>-- Stephan swings at her but she gets inside it, raises her arm and the 
      shovel -- CRACK - splinters in half as it hits her forearm. With the other 
      arm she wrenches the half he's holding out of his grasp and SHOVES it into 
      his heart. 
      <p>He turns to DUST. 
      <p>Angel rises, rubbing his head. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>And what do you mean, "He's just a kid."<br/>Does that 
      mean I'm just a kid too?</center>
<p>Angel starts to answer, then just shakes his head. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>Look, obviously I made a mistake<br/>coming here 
      tonight...</center>
<p>Angel turns and starts away, going around the tree. Buffy quickly 
      starts after him, working to catch up. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh, no you don't. You can't just<br/>turn and walk away. 
      It takes more<br/>then that to get rid of me...</center>
<p>And suddenly, BUFFY DROPS OUT OF FRAME. 
      <p>ANGLE: LOOKING DOWN INTO AN OPEN GRAVE 
      <p>Buffy lays in an open, silk-upholstered coffin at the bottom of the six 
      foot hole. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL (O.S.)<br/>You okay?</center>
<p>Buffy looks up at Angel, who crouches at the edge of the grave above, 
      looking down. She sits up slowly, stiffly. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I wish people wouldn't leave open<br/>graves laying around 
      like this.</center>
<p>She rises from the box, looking to Angel for a hand up and out. But 
      he's standing again, scanning the cemetery. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>So another vampire has risen tonight.</center>
<p>ANGLE ON: BUFFY STIL IN THE HOLE 
      <p>At eye level with the ground around the open grave. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(soberly)<br/>I don't think so.<br/>(creeped)<br/>Whoever 
      was buried here didn't rise<br/>from this grave...</center>
<p>RACK FOCUS: 
      <p>To two shallow depressions in the grass. We don't need to know what 
      they are -- Buffy does. She jumps out of the grave. 
      <p>BUFFY'S POV - AT GROUND LEVEL 
      <p>Tracking fast through the grass (and the depressions) to a WHITE, 
      FORMAL WOMAN'S SHOE, left behind. A hand enters frame, picks up the shoe, 
      takes us to Buffy: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>...she was dragged from it.</center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
      <p>Buffy and XANDER enter. GILES, his back toward them, doesn't notice 
      their entrance. He's busy TALKING TO AN EMPTY CHAIR. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>So, what I'm proposing... and I don't<br/>mean to appear 
      indecorous... is a<br/>social engagement... a date, if you<br/>will. If 
      you're amenable...<br/>(then, edgy)<br/>Idiot! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Boy. I guess we just never realized<br/>how much you liked that 
      chair. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(turns, frustrated)<br/>Oh, I, uh, I was just working on-- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Your pick-up lines? 
      <p>GILES<br/>(busted)<br/>In a manner of speaking, yes. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Then, if you don't mind a little Gene<br/>and Roger, I would 
      leave off the <br/>"idiot" part. Being called an idiot<br/>tends to take a 
      person out of the<br/>dating mood. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Actually, it kind of turns me on. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(to Xander)<br/>I fear you.<br/>(to Giles)<br/>I'd also avoid 
      words like "amenable"<br/>and "indecorous." Speak English, not<br/>whatever 
      they speak in... 
      <p>GILES<br/>England? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. Just say, "Hey, I got a thing,<br/>you're maybe feeling a 
      thing, and<br/>there could be a thing." 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, thank you, Cyrano. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm not finished. Then you say, "How<br/>do you feel about 
      Mexican?" 
      <p>GILES<br/>About Mexicans? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Mexican! Food. You take her for<br/>food. For which you then 
      pay. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Right. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(to Giles, re: chair)<br/>So, this "chair" woman? We 
      are<br/>talking Ms. Calendar, right? 
      <p>GILES<br/>What makes you think that? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Simple deduction: Ms. Calendar is<br/>reasonably dollsome, 
      especially for<br/>someone in your age bracket; she<br/>already knows you're 
      a school librarian,<br/>so you don't have to worry about how to<br/>break 
      that embarrassing news to her... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And she's the only woman we've ever<br/>actually seen speaking 
      to you.<br/>Add it all up, it spells "duh." 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Now, is it time for us to talk about<br/>the facts of life? 
      <p>GILES<br/>I am suddenly deciding that this<br/>is none of your business. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>'Cause that whole stork thing is a<br/>smokescreen...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles pointedly changes the subject. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>So, how did things go last night?<br/>Did Mr. Korshack 
      show up on schedule? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>More or less. Angel and I took care of him. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(snorts)<br/>Angel. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>There's something else, though.<br/>I found an empty grave. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Another vampire? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, no. It was dug up, and the<br/>body was taken out. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(into it)<br/>Grave robbing. Well, that's new.<br/>Interesting. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I know that you meant to say "gross<br/>and disturbing". 
      <p>GILES<br/>(sheepish)<br/>Yes of course. Terrible thing. Must<br/>put a 
      stop to it.<br/>(feebly adds)<br/>Dammit. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So why does someone rob graves? 
      <p>GILES<br/>I'll collate some theories. Might<br/>help to know who the body 
      belonged to. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Meredith Todd. Ring a bell?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander shakes his head. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>She died very recently. And she was<br/>our age. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Drawing a blank. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, perhaps Willow can fire up the<br/>machine <br/>(points at 
      computer) <br/>and track Meredith down.</p></p></center>
<p>INT. SCHOOL LOUNGE - DAY 
      <p>A table is set up beneath a banner: "SCIENCE FAIR SIGN-UP." WILLOW is 
      writing on one of the clipboards. She looks up to see: 
      <p>ANGLE: A CAMERA 
      <p>Going off in her face. ERIC is an annoying, aggressive science nerd who 
      right now is taking pictures of every pretty girl who passes by. 
      <p>He turns the lens on a passing senior, looking her up and down. 
      <p>
<center>ERIC<br/>Look at those legs... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No thank you. 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>Eric, knock it off.</p></p></center>
<p>Willow glances over at CHRIS EPPS, who picks up the clipboard next to 
      her. He's shy and brainy, but he has a quiet authority. 
      <p>Chris glances up to see Willow watching him write. She reacts. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Hey, Chris. I was just wondering<br/>what you're going to 
      do this year. 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>(smiles awkwardly)<br/>Why? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well, every year, you win and I place<br/>second. I just 
      thought I'd see what<br/>I'm up against. 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>You know what the key is? If Dr. <br/>Clark doesn't understand 
      your <br/>experiment, he gives it higher marks<br/>so it looks like he 
      understands your<br/>experiment.<br/>(reads 
      Willow's<br/>clipboard)<br/>"Effects of Subviolet Light 
      Spectrum<br/>Deprivation on the Development of Fruit Flies."<br/>(smiles, 
      friendly)<br/>That should do the trick.</p></p></p></center>
<p>CORDELIA steps up beside Willow, picks up a clipboard, starts writing. 
      She is not radiating sunshine. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Okay, I'm doing this under protest.<br/>It is not fair 
      that they're making<br/>participation in the Science Fair <br/>mandatory 
      this year. I don't think <br/>anyone should have to do anything 
      <br/>educational at school if they don't <br/>want to. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(reading from<br/>Cordelia's entry)<br/>"The Tomato: Fruit or 
      Vegetable?" 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I want something I can finish in a<br/>weekend, 
      okay?</p></p></center>
<p>Just then, Eric appears and begins aggressively snapping photos of 
      Cordelia. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd) <br/>What do you think you're doing?! <br/>Stop 
      it! We're under fluorescent <br/>lights, for god's sake!</center>
<p>Cordelia turns away 
      <p>
<center>ERIC<br/>Come on. The camera loves you. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I thought yearbook nerds didn't come<br/>out of hibernation 
      till the spring. 
      <p>ERIC<br/>It's for my private collection. 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>Eric, will you quit it? </p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy enters. Eric snaps her picture. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Coming through.<br/>(then, to Willow)<br/>Hey, Willow, 
      sorry to interrupt, <br/>but.. it's the Bat Signal. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Sure, okay.<br/>(smiles to Chris)<br/>See you, Chris. Thanks 
      for the tip.</p></center>
<p>Chris smiles at Willow as she leaves with Buffy. Cordelia lingers, but 
      when she sees Eric's leer, she quickly follows. Eric watches her go, with 
      a malevolent grin. 
      <p>
<center>ERIC<br/>Cordelia is so fine. You know, she'd <br/>be just perfect 
      for us... 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>(sternly)<br/>Don't be an idiot.<br/>(turns away) <br/>She's 
      alive.</p></center>
<p>Chris crosses off, leaving Eric to continue watching Cordelia walk 
      away. Eric's creepy smile returns. 
      <p>INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
      <p>Willow settles in at the computer. Buffy et al. hover. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>This shouldn't take long. I'm <br/>probably the only girl 
      in school who <br/>has the Coroner's Office bookmarked <br/>as a "favorite 
      place."</center>
<p>Willow starts her web search as Cordelia enters. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Hi. Sorry to interrupt your little<br/>undead play 
      group, but I need to ask<br/>Willow if she'll help me with my<br/>Science 
      Fair project. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(not looking up) <br/>It's a fruit. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I would ask Chris for help, but... <br/>(a little 
      emotional)<br/>it would bring back too many <br/>memories of Daryl. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I found it...</p></p></p></center>
<p>The gang gathers around Willow at the computer screen, ignoring 
      Cordelia. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>According to this, Meredith Todd died<br/>in a 
      car accident last week. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Of course, I've learned to deal with<br/>my pain... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And how was her neck? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Fine... except for being broken. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Hello? Can we deal with my pain<br/>please? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>There there.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander, without looking at Cordelia and without feeling, pats her 
      shoulder. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>It says Meredith and two other girls<br/>in the car were 
      killed instantly.<br/>They were all on the pep squad at<br/>Fondren High, on 
      the way to a game. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You know what this means... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>That Fondren might actually beat <br/>Sunnydale in the 
      cross-town body <br/>count competition this year? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It means she wasn't killed by <br/>vampires. So somebody did 
      dig up her <br/>corpse. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Eeuw. Why is it that every<br/>conversation you people have 
      has the <br/>word "corpse" in it? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So, okay, we got us a body snatcher. <br/>What does that mean? 

      <p>GILES<br/>Here's what I've come up with: demons<br/>who eat the flesh of 
      the dead to <br/>absorb their souls.<br/>Or it could be a 
      voodoo<br/>practitioner-- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You mean, making a zombie? 
      <p>GILES<br/>More likely, zombies. For most <br/>traditional purposes, a 
      voodoo priest<br/>would need more than one. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So we should see if the other girls <br/>from this accident are 
      AWOL, too. <br/>Might help figure out what this creep <br/>has in mind if we 
      know whether he's <br/>dealing in volume. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So we dig up some graves tonight? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh boy, a field trip!<br/>(to Buffy) <br/>Are you gonna call 
      Angel? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't think so. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yeah, why bother him? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We've been sort of... never mind. As <br/>far as Angel knows, 
      I'm taking the <br/>night off. Okay? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So, we're all set, then. Say <br/>nine-ish, B.Y.O. shovel. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'll pack some food. Who likes those <br/>little powdered 
      donuts?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander raises his hand. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Cordelia? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Darn, I have Cheerleader practice <br/>tonight. Boy, I wish 
      I'd known you <br/>were gonna be digging up dead people<br/>sooner; I would 
      have cancelled. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>All right. But if you do run into <br/>the army of zombies, 
      could you page<br/>us before they eat your flesh?</p></p></center>
<p>Trying not to be affected by that idea, Cordelia exits. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Xander, Zombies don't eat the flesh <br/>of the living. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I know, but did you see her face?</p></center>
<p>ANGLE ON: THE LIBRARY'S COMPUTER SCREEN

      <p>Buffy with her back to a tombstone next to Willow. Before them, Xander 
      and Giles wield shovels, already pretty deep into the ground, and way 
      grimed from the effort. As they talk, Willow munches a little powdered 
      donut. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>He was getting all jealous and he <br/>wouldn't even admit 
      it. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Jealous of what? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Of Xander. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>'Cause you did that sexy dance with him? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(sheepishly)<br/>Am I ever gonna live that down? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(blithely)<br/>Nope. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Anyway, Angel's being totally irrational. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Love makes you do the wacky. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's the truth. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(sticks his head out)<br/>You know, this might go faster if 
      you <br/>fems picked up a shovel, too. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Sorry, but I'm an old-fashioned girl. <br/>I was raised to 
      believe the men dig <br/>up the corpses and the women have <br/>the 
      babies.<br/>(to Willow)<br/>Speaking of the wacky, what was <br/>Cordelia's 
      whole riff about painful <br/>memories? Who's Daryl? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Daryl Epps. Chris's older brother. <br/>He was a big football 
      star. All-State<br/>two years ago. A running... someone <br/>that runs and 
      catches. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Was he a studly? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Big time. All the girls were crazy <br/>for him. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And he broke Cordy's heart? Thus <br/>possibly proving its 
      existence... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>He died. Rock climbing, or <br/>something. He fell. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh, man. That's lousy. Poor Chris. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(nodding)<br/>He really looked up to his brother. <br/>It was 
      tough. Ever since then he's <br/>been... real quiet. Kind of in his <br/>own 
      world. And I hear his mother <br/>doesn't even leave the house 
      anymore.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>THUNK. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I think we're there.</center>
<p>Buffy and Willow peer over the edge of the open grave as Giles and 
      Xander quickly clear the top of the coffin. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>By the way, are we hoping to find a <br/>body, or no 
      body? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Call me an optimist, but I'm hoping <br/>to find a fortune in 
      gold dubloons. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, "body" could mean flesh eating <br/>demon or 
      corpse-mutilating pagan <br/>ritual. "No body" points more toward <br/>the 
      army of zombies thing. Take your <br/>pick.</p></p></center>
<p>Everyone looks on in anticipation as Giles and Xander each wait for the 
      other to do the honors. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Go ahead. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You're closer. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Pathetic much?</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy agilely drops down, takes a deep breath and reaches for the latch 
      that will open the top half of the hinged coffin lid. 
      <p>BLACK, INSIDE THE COFFIN. 
      <p>As the lid is opened and WE LOOK up at our quartet, who look back at 
      us. 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
      <p>Cordelia and TWO OTHER CHEERLEADERS in full uniform talk as they cross 
      the school student parking lot after practice. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Guys, if we don't have it down by <br/>tomorrow then no 
      one will be led by <br/>our cheers. Practice.</center>
<p>The other cheerleaders get in their car and drive off, leaving Cordelia 
      to cross to her car several yards away. 
      <p>She feels like someone's watching. She stops, scans the lot. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd) <br/>Hello?</center>
<p>No answer. She digs her keys from her purse as she quickens her pace to 
      her car. She looks around again. No one. 
      <p>She puts the key in the lock, then hears a WHOOSH sound. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd) <br/>Xander Harris, if this is your idea of a 
      joke...</center>
<p>Another SOUND. Closer. 
      <p>Cordelia juggles her keychain, fumbles it to the ground. The keys 
      glance off her shoe and skitter under the car. <p.cordelia,>p sees- she 
      car, the beneath looks as But keys. her retrieve to try crouches now, wig 
      maximum at&gt;FEET, two, standing right on the other side of her car. 
      <p>Cordelia freaks, leaves her keys and takes off running, away from the 
      car, toward the nearest school building. 
      <p>We see the FORM of SOMEONE coming around the car after her. 
      <p>EXT. SCHOOL/AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT 
      <p>An alleyway formed by the wall of a separate building and the main 
      school building. It's deserted, save for a couple of FOOTBALL BLOCKING 
      SLEDS and orange DRIVER'S ED. CONES stored there beside a GARBAGE 
      DUMPSTER. 
      <p>A SHADOW, Cordelia's pursuer, drifts slowly past the objects, pausing 
      for only a moment before moving along. 
      <p>Then, all is quiet. 
      <p>CLOSER ON: THE DUMPSTER 
      <p>As Cordelia slowly, tentatively sticks her head up and looks left, then 
      right into the eyes of-- 
      <p>ANGEL 
      <p>Cordelia screams, falls back. Angel smiles. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>Cordelia. This is the last place I <br/>expected you to 
      hang out. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(recovering, slowly)<br/>Oh, god... oh, god, it's 
      you.<br/>Why were you following me? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>I wasn't sure it was you at first. <br/>I'm looking for Buffy. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Buffy? Well, she's -- big shock --<br/>at the graveyard. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>She said she'd be home. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Oh, she lied. Isn't she a rascal?</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Angel reacts, affected by this, betrayed. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd)<br/>But, luck is on your side, it just so 
      <br/>happens my night's free...</center>
<p>Cordelia holds out her hand. Angel, somewhat reluctantly, takes it, to 
      help her climb out. The back of her dress gets stuck on something. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd)<br/>Hold on, my dress is caught...</center>
<p>She reaches behind her, pulls something loose. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd)<br/>There, that's...</center>
<p>Cordelia sees what she just pulled loose behind her: a human hand, 
      severed a ways below the wrist. Cordelia holds it at the wrist. Cordelia 
      screams.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - (SAME) NIGHT 
      <p>WE HEAR VOICES approaching from the hallway. The doors open as Buffy, 
      Willow, Xander and Giles return from the cemetery. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>So, both coffins empty, that makes <br/>three girls 
      signed up for the army of <br/>zombies. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Is it an army if you just have three? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, Zombie drill team then -- 
      <p>ANGEL'S VOICE (O.S.) <br/>You're back...</p></p></p></center>
<p>Angel steps from the shadows, Cordelia clinging to him with a hermetic 
      seal, her head buried in his chest. Buffy reacts. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Angel...?</center>
<p>She stops, standing right by Xander, a fact not lost on Angel. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>(greeting him) <br/>Xander. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(equally enthused)<br/>Angel. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>I thought you were taking the night off. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I was... going to. But, at the last <br/>minute- - 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Cordelia told me the truth. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>That's gotta be a first. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We were investigating... somebody's<br/>been stealing the 
      bodies of dead<br/>girls. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>I know. We found some of them. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You mean like two of the three? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>I mean, like some of them. Like <br/>parts. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(finally looking up)<br/>It was horrible. Angel saved me 
      from <br/>an arm.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Another look between Angel and Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd) <br/>God, there were parts everywhere. <br/>Why do 
      these terrible things always <br/>happen to me? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(coughing the word in<br/>to his fist) <br/>Karma! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well, so much for the zombie theory. 
      <p>GILES<br/>So much for all our theories. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't get it. Why dig up three <br/>bodies, just to chop them 
      up and<br/>throw them away again? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>What I saw didn't add up to three <br/>whole girls. I think 
      they kept some <br/>parts. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Could this get yuckier? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>They probably kept the other parts to <br/>eat. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Question answered. 
      <p>GILES<br/>But why dispose of the remains here<br/>at the school? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Maybe whoever did it had other <br/>business in the 
      neighborhood. Like, <br/>say... classes. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>This was no hatchet job. Whoever <br/>made those incisions 
      really knew what <br/>they were doing. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes, what student here would be that <br/>well-versed in 
      physiology? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I can think of maybe five or six guys<br/>in the science club. 

      <p>BUFFY<br/>Why don't you get their locker <br/>numbers, and we'll check 
      'em out. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(pitifully)<br/>No, I want to go home now. I have to 
      <br/>bathe and burn my clothes. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Everybody wave bye-bye. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I don't want to go alone. I'm still <br/>fragile.<br/>(to 
      Angel)<br/>Can you take me? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>I...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Angel turns toward Buffy. She looks away. Cordelia quickly wraps an arm 
      around Angel. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Great! I'll drive.</center>
<p>With a look back, Angel is dragged from the library by Cordelia. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>How about that? I always pegged him as a <br/>"one woman" 
      vampire. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Xander!</p></center>
<p>Willow nudges Xander, gestures toward Buffy. 
      <p>But Buffy is staring at the library door. She hasn't heard a word said 
      since the doors closed behind Angel. 
      <p>INT. CHRIS'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>CHRIS'S MOM, in a loose floral house dress, sits in a worn arm chair. A 
      cigarette, burning a quarter inch into the filter, hangs from her lips. 
      Her empty gaze is fixed on a television set OFF CAMERA. The house is 
      unkempt, dark and depressing. 
      <p>Chris enters from downstairs, carefully shutting the cellar door behind 
      him. On the door we see a sign that says: NO TRESPASSING - KEEP OUT! 
      (Typical of a teenager, it's cluttered with other signs as well, and 
      stickers and whatnot.) 
      <p>
<center>CHRIS<br/>I'm going out, mom.</center>
<p>Chris's Mom doesn't react, doesn't even acknowledge him. 
      <p>
<center>CHRIS (cont'd)<br/>I'll be back later, okay? Mom...?</center>
<p>Still nothing but cigarette smoke from Chris's Mom. After a beat, Chris 
      finally goes, leaving his Mom in her smoking world. 
      <p>ANGLE: THE TV 
      <p>We see a home vid of a football game -- a victorious Daryl Epps running 
      up to the camera, smiling. 
      <p>INT. HALL - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow and Xander are opening lockers using info from copies of a 
      computer print-out. Giles sort of hovers behind them. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>(officious)<br/>I hope you understand that as a <br/>school 
      official, I can not condone <br/>this unauthorized search. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay, your butt's covered. You want <br/>to grab a locker? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes of course.</p></p></center>
<p>Giles takes a sheet from Buffy and crosses to a locker. Buffy crosses 
      to Eric's, saying: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Okay, Eric, let's see what's on your <br/>mind.</center>
<p>Willow opens a locker. It's full of magazines. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Nothing but back issues of<br/>"Scientific 
      American."<br/>(lights up)<br/>Ooh, I haven't read this one. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Nothing remarkable here... 
      <p>XANDER (O.S.)<br/>Guys...</p></p></center>
<p>Giles and Willow cross to Xander. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Your friend, Chris Epps' locker.</center>
<p>He opens the door wider, revealing a stack of books inside. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>"Gray's Anatomy", "Mortician's Desk<br/>Reference", 
      "Robicheaux's Guide to<br/>Muscles and Tendons".</center>
<p>MOVE DOWN THE BOOKS' SPINES, with titles like <u>Gray's Anatomy</u>, 
      <u>Mortician's Desk Reference</u>, <u>Robicheaux's Guide to Muscles and 
      Tendons</u>, etc. 
      <p>Giles reaches in, pulls out a folded section of the local newspaper, 
      open to the story and NEWS PHOTO OF THE THREE DEAD PEP SQUAD GIRLS we saw 
      on Willow's computer screen before. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Fair to say, Chris is involved. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>He's into corpses, all right, but we <br/>still don't know 
      why. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yes we do.</p></p></center>
<p>She is staring at Eric's locker. Taped inside that locker door-- 
      <p>THE PICTURE OF A WOMAN 
      <p>Actually, it's a COLLAGE, with various facial features and body parts 
      torn from different MODELS in magazine ads and pasted together to form a 
      grotesque image of an "ideal" woman. 
      <p>
<div align="right">DISSOLVE TO:</div>
<p>INT. LAB (OLD SCIENCE BUILDING) - NIGHT 
      <p>ANGLE: BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF AN OPERATING TABLE 
      <p>There is a body clearly defined under the sheet on this table, (framed 
      to match the size and angle of the locker collage). 
      <p>Walking around the table is Chris. He lifts part of the sheet, hooks an 
      electrode to a foot. 
      <p>ANGLE: ERIC 
      <p>Emerges from a small darkroom off the lab, a few still-dripping photos 
      in his hands. He is singing to himself: 
      <p>
<center>ERIC<br/>(sings)<br/>I GUESS, YOU'D SAY, WHAT CAN MAKE ME<br/>FEEL 
      THIS WAY. MY GIRL... <br/>(to Chris)<br/>How's my baby? 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>She's not your baby. 
      <p>ERIC<br/>She's not gonna be anyone's baby if <br/>we don't finish her 
      soon. 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>I'm working on it. 
      <p>ERIC<br/>So am I, friend. So am I.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>As he says this he hangs the photos on a line with some others. They 
      are all photos of Sunnydale girls, including Buffy, Willow and Cordelia. 
      <p>He goes back into the dark room, passing the body and for the first 
      time we see up close: 
      <p>HER LEG 
      <p>Which has clearly been sewn together. 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>A DREAM GIRL 
      <p>That is, a fantastic looking SENIOR GIRL as she walks across-- 
      <p>EXT. QUAD - THE NEXT MORNING 
      <p>A TRIO of GEEKISH GUYS worshipfully watch her every step. 
      <p>ANGLE ON: XANDER AND WILLOW 
      <p>As they sit together on the front steps of the school. Buffy joins 
      them, watching the geek trio watching the dream girl. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Any sign of our suspects? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Not yet.</p></center>
<p>She sits, still looking at the people around her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I don't get it, why would anyone want<br/>to make 
      a girl? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You mean, when there's so many <br/>pre-made ones just lying 
      around?<br/>(shrugs)<br/>The things we do for love... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Love has nothing to do with this. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Maybe not, but I'll tell you this:<br/>People don't fall in 
      love with <br/>what's right in front of them. People <br/>want the dream. 
      What they can't have. <br/>The more unattainable,<br/>the more 
      attractive.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy reacts. This notion strikes a chord -- actually with all three of 
      them. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>And for Eric the unattainable would <br/>include 
      everyone. That's alive. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Eric's sick enough to do something <br/>like this, but what's 
      up with Chris? <br/>He seems like a human person. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't know. The thing with his <br/>brother was really hard 
      on him; <br/>He talked a lot about death. Maybe he <br/>just wants to get 
      one up on it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(hesitantly)<br/>But, it's not... doable, is it? I <br/>mean, 
      making someone from scraps? <br/>Actually making them live? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>If it is, my science project's <br/>definitely coming in 
      second this year.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles emerges from the school. He scans the ARRIVING CROWD, not 
      noticing Buffy and company. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>And speaking of love... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>We were talking about the reanimation <br/>of dead tissue. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Do I deconstruct your segues? Yeesh. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hey, Giles 
      <p>GILES<br/>Oh. Yes. Hello. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Still no sign of our mad doctors. 
      <p>GILES<br/>What? Oh. Corpses. Evil. Very <br/>good.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy turns, sees what Giles sees. MS. CALENDAR is coming. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Okay, Giles, just remember. "I'm <br/>feeling a thing, 
      you're feeling a <br/>thing." But personalize it. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(nervously)<br/>Personalize it? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>She's a techno-pagan, right? Ask her<br/>to bless your laptop 
      or something.<br/>(to the others) <br/>Come on, guys.</p></p></center>
<p>She nudges the other two and they take off. Giles turns as the trio 
      disappears into the school. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>No! Don't leave me! Oh, dear.</center>
<p>And Ms. Calendar is there, passing Giles on her way inside. 
      <p>
<center>MS. CALENDAR<br/>Good morning, Rupert. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(nods, nervously)<br/>Ms. Calendar. 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>(stops, turns back) <br/>Please, call me Jennie. "Ms." 
      <br/>Calendar is my father. 
      <p>GILES <br/>Jenny, then.</p></p></p></center>
<p>They head: 
      <p>INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>You know, uh, Jenny, I don't mean to <br/>appear 
      indecorous... no, not<br/>indecorous... 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>(smiles expectantly) <br/>Yeah...? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Oh, dear... I, uh... that is... 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR <br/>(a beat, then)<br/>Rupert, look, I have to get inside 
      to <br/>set up the computer lab... 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, what I am proposing is...</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>The SCHOOL BELL RINGS, and PEOPLE start moving inside. 
      <p>
<center>MS. CALENDAR<br/>Sorry, but I really have to go.</center>
<p>Giles nods and Ms. Calendar turns and crosses to the door. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>(to himself) <br/>Idiot...</center>
<p>Giles is startled as Ms. Calendar reappears beside him. 
      <p>
<center>MS. CALENDAR<br/>Listen, if it's important, why don't <br/>you just 
      tell me at the game? 
      <p>GILES<br/>You're going to the football game? 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>You seem surprised. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I guess I just assumed you spent your <br/>evenings downloading 
      incantations... <br/>casting bones. 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>On game night? Are you nuts? I <br/>assume you're going, 
      too. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Oh, uh, of course. 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>So, why don't we just go together? <br/>I could pick you 
      up after school, we <br/>could get something to eat on the <br/>way, if you 
      like. How do you feel <br/>about Mexican?</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles can manage no better than a twitchy nod.

<p>INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON 
      <p>Xander is playing with a visible head as Willow pores over volumes. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I still don't get how Chris could do<br/>it. Arresting 
      the cell deterioration <br/>is one thing, but...</center>
<p>Xander makes the head talk. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Hello... I want to get ahead! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Maybe an electrical current combined <br/>with an adrenaline 
      boost... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(as the head)<br/>For the love of God, somebody scratch <br/>my 
      nose!</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy enters, all business. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Well, it's official. Chris and Eric <br/>didn't come to 
      school today. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>That's not a coincidence. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Maybe they finished their project. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>God, what if it worked, what if that <br/>poor girl is walking 
      around... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Uh, poor girls, technically. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What could she be thinking? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>And what are they... going to do with <br/>her? 
      <p>GILES<br/>I don't think we have to worry about <br/>that just 
      yet.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>All turn as he enters. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>I contacted the police this morning <br/>about 
      the remains. They've just <br/>finished sorting through them. 
      <br/>Apparently, there were three heads in <br/>the dumpster. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And they only had three girls. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>So they don't have the whole, uh, <br/>package. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Heads must be no good. Hrnmmm, they <br/>seemed attractive 
      enough to me...<br/>(off their looks, <br/>with some pride) <br/>obviously 
      I'm not as sick as Chris<br/>and Eric. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Based on what the police put <br/>together, they're one step 
      away from <br/>completing their masterpiece. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>One step...</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>As the four of them contemplate this, the camera ARMS DOWN, the visible 
      head filling the frame. 
      <p>ANGLE: THE DOOR TO CHRIS'S BASEMENT 
      <p>We track slowly in at the sign that says: NO TRESPASSING - KEEP OUT! 
      (A.D.'s beware, Chris' mom may be in the shot.) 
      <p>
<center>ERIC (V.O.)<br/>We're running out of time!</center>
<p>INT. STORAGE ROOM/BASEMENT - DAY 
      <p>Chris and Eric are in a dark, cramped, cluttered room filled with 
      dust-covered pieces of furniture, boxes, etc. The room is lit only by a 
      single bare light bulb and a shaft of light angling down from a small 
      clerestory window above. 
      <p>
<center>ERIC<br/>If we wait too long, the onset of <br/>atrophy in the limbs 
      will be <br/>irreversible. 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>We can turn up the current. That'll <br/>buy us a day at least. 

      <p>ERIC<br/>We'll lose the entire body if we <br/>don't attach the head 
      soon! 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>We have time! 
      <p>ERIC<br/>We don't! The crash with the girls <br/>was lucky. But we can't 
      keep waiting <br/>for another lucky accident to just <br/>drop a head in our 
      laps. You know <br/>what we have to do! Hell, it's just <br/>one lousy girl! 

      <p>CHRIS<br/>I won't do it... I can't <br/>(softer, cracking)<br/>I can't... 
      kill anyone.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Chris turns toward a DARK, SHADOWY RECESS of the storage room behind 
      them. 
      <p>
<center>CHRIS (cont'd)<br/>(to the shadows)<br/>Please understand. I can't 
      do that. <br/>Please don't make me. 
      <p>VOICE FROM THE SHADOWS <br/>(low, eerie)<br/>But, you gave me your 
      word... you <br/>promised me, little brother...</p></center>
<p>THE VOICE slowly steps forward from the shadows. 
      <p>This big, hulking THING has ONE GREEN EYE AND ONE BROWN EYE. His face - 
      all of him that we can see - has been stitched together. The guy's a 
      walking jig-saw puzzle.

      DAY 
      <p>Daryl paces around the cluttered room like a caged animal. Chris leans 
      against a wall, a bit intimidated. Eric watches Daryl with the pride of a 
      parent watching his offspring. 
      <p>
<center>ERIC<br/>The body is perfect. And if we <br/>harvest a head tonight, 
      she'll be <br/>ready by sunrise.</center>
<p>Daryl goes to Chris, crouches down to his brother's eye level. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL<br/>When you brought me back, you <br/>promised you'd take 
      care of me. I <br/>need this, Chris. I need someone. 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>Please don't ask me to do this. <br/>Don't ask me to take a 
      life. 
      <p>ERIC<br/>I tried to tell him, if you take a <br/>life to make a new life, 
      the whole <br/>thing's a wash. No harm, no foul. 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>Maybe you could... you could go out, <br/>let people know -- 
      <p>DARYL<br/>No! Can't see me.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>His fury is sudden -- and suddenly gone. He approaches his brother. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL (cont'd) <br/>Chris, you've always been smarter <br/>than me. 
      You were the brains. <br/>You're the only one who can do this <br/>for 
      me.</center>
<p>Chris stares at him, uncertain. Daryl begins an old chant, one that 
      sounds odd and forlorn down here: 
      <p>
<center>DARYL (cont'd)<br/>Third and long, seconds to go, <br/>where do you 
      throw, where do you throw... 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>(quietly)<br/>Number five, Daryl's gonna drive.

<p>Chris nods silent acquiescence. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL (cont'd)<br/>Thank you.</center>
<p>Daryl gently kisses the top of Chris's head, then turns to Eric. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL (cont'd)<br/>Show me!</center>
<p>Eric takes his girl pix from his backpack, fans them out on a chest of 
      drawers as Daryl starts leafing through them. As Eric smiles a malignant 
      smile back toward the still bowed Chris, Daryl selects one of the photos 
      and hands it to Eric. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL (cont'd)<br/>This one.

      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Well, I've checked the obits. <br/>Nothing that would 
      make for a likely <br/>candidate. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>They're kinda picky for guys who had<br/>three heads to begin 
      with. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Formaldahyde. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Come again? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes of course. It accelerates neural <br/>decay in the brain

      <p>WILLOW<br/>As fresh as possible... <br/>(gets it)<br/>Buffy, you don't 
      think they'd... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I think anyone who cuts dead girls <br/>into pieces does not 
      get the benefit <br/>of any doubt. Let's end this thing. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Seconded. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(to Xander and Willow) <br/>You two head to Eric's. I'll try

<p>INT. CHRIS'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
      <p>As CHRIS'S MOM, with housedress and ever-present cigarette, stands 
      inside the door. She is looking at: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>I'm a friend of Chris's. Is he home?</center>
<p>Without a word, she turns, waddles away. Buffy steps inside and 
      tentatively looks about her. 
      <p>Buffy sees a small, musty room where Chris's mom has already settled 
      back into her well-worn armchair two feet in front of the television 
      screen, Buffy all but forgotten. 
      <p>The walls of the room are papered with photos of Daryl in his football 
      uniform, articles about Daryl's triumphs clipped from the sports page, 
      Daryl's framed letter sweaters, etc. 
      <p>Buffy looks around, takes it all in: Daryl Epps was a good- looking kid 
      who apparently had a full and active life. 
      <p>And this room is his SHRINE. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(a beat, then) <br/>So... is Chris home? 
      <p>CHRIS'S MOM<br/>(points to TV screen)<br/>Westbury game. November 17, 
      95.<br/>Daryl rushed 185 yards that night -<br/>four TDs. He was MVP and 
      made All <br/>City that season--</p></center>
<p>Buffy looks at the TV. An amateur videotape of a high school football 
      game plays on screen. A stack of videotapes labeled with dates and names 
      of opponents sits atop the set. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(a bit wigged)<br/>Yea, that was a great one... but 
      is<br/>Chris home? 
      <p>CHRIS'S MOM<br/>I don't know... is today a school day?<br/>(leans 
      toward<br/>screen/intense)<br/>Watch - watch this move. Daryl takes<br/>the 
      kick off, sheds one - two - three<br/>defenders! He breaks into the 
      open<br/>field for a 95 yard touch down.<br/>(matter-of-fact)<br/>He would 
      have been nineteen next<br/>week, you know.</p></center>
<p>Buffy looks down at Chris's Mom, who has never taken her eyes off the 
      television screen or taken the cigarette from her lips. After a beat, 
      Buffy starts to back out of the room. 
      <p>(NOTE: HEATING GRATE OMITTED) 
      <p>Buffy looks about her, going to head further into the house when she 
      sees the sign: 
      <p>NO TRESPASSING - KEEP OUT! 
      <p>One last look to make sure Mom is oblivious, and she opens the door. 
      <p>INT. BASEMENT/DARYL'S LAIR - SAME TIME - DAY 
      <p>Dark, deserted looking. Buffy comes down the steps slowly. She scans 
      the room, spots Eric's GIRL PHOTOS atop the chest of drawers. She picks 
      them up, starts looking through them. One of the photos has the head cut 
      off. Then she sees: 
      <p>A MEDICAL DRAWING 
      <p>Chris's work: it's of a woman's body, with muscles, joints , all kinds 
      of equations and science type stuff (English major much?) scribbled all 
      over it. And pasted over the head is the photo of CORDELIA. 
      <p>BEHIND HER, (right behind her if possible) Daryl emerges from the 
      blackness. Buffy doesn't see him, intent upon the drawing: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(under her breath)<br/>Cordelia...</center>
<p>Daryl is about to grab her when he HEARS a CREAKING FLOORBOARD 
      upstairs. Footsteps approaching. Daryl backs into the blackness from 
      whence he came. Buffy looks up towards the cellar door then leaps, spins 
      off an overhead water pipe and zips out an open clerestory window. 
      <p>Hold the darkness, finding for a moment Daryl's tortured face in it. 
      <p>INT. CHEERLEADING PREP ROOM AT THE STADIUM - NIGHT 
      <p>The two cheerleaders we saw the night before in the parking lot with 
      Cordelia are dressed and ready. Cordelia is doing last minute touch-ups at 
      one of the make-up mirrors. 
      <p>
<center>FIRST CHEERLEADER<br/>Cordelia, you coming? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I'll be right out.</p></center>
<p>The cheerleaders exit, leaving Cordelia alone. She looks in the mirror, 
      then glances down to her make-up tray. When she looks back up into the 
      mirror again, she sees-- 
      <p>CHRIS 
      <p>--standing slumped back by the lockers behind her. She jumps, then 
      recognizes him. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd)<br/>Oh, Chris! Hi. God, you scared me. 
      <br/>(concerned)<br/>What are you doing in here?</center>
<p>Chris winces, turns his head as if to avoid seeing something. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd) <br/>Is something wrong...?</center>
<p>THE CLOTH SACK that SLAMS down over Cordelia's head seems to come out 
      of nowhere. 
      <p>INT. HALL BY PREP ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 
      <p>The two cheerleaders head towards double doors, through which we can 
      hear the cheering of a good-sized crowd. 
      <p>Buffy runs up to them. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(with urgency) <br/>Joy, Lisa, where's Cordelia? 
      <p>FIRST CHEERLEADER <br/>(haughty)<br/>Cordelia's got a game to think 
      about. <br/>She doesn't need losers like you --</p></center>
<p>Buffy slaps a hand against the wall on either side of the first 
      cheerleader's head, pinning the wide-eyed girl. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(sweetly)<br/>I'm sorry... where, did you say?</center>
<p>INT. CHEERLEADING PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 
      <p>The door collapses as Buffy charges into the room. Eric looks up from 
      tying up the struggling Cordelia on the floor. 
      <p>Buffy leaps, heel kicks Eric off her, against a wall. In no mood to 
      fight, he beats a quick retreat out a back door. 
      <p>Buffy turns back, quickly removes the cloth sack hood from a nearly 
      hysterical Cordelia. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>It's okay, you're okay. He's gone. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Oh, my god, Buffy...! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He's gone. What happened? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I don't know. I was just about to go<br/>to the field when 
      Chris came in, and<br/>then somebody just jumped me.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy quickly looks around the room. No sign of anyone here. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Well, it's okay now. You're fine.<br/>Just relax, take 
      your time...</center>
<p>Cordelia rises, works to compose herself. It looks like this could take 
      awhile. But the sound of the-- 
      <p>MARCHING BAND 
      <p>--playing the SUNNYDALE FIGHT SONG out on the field drifts into the 
      room, instantly perking Cordelia. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Oh, my god! That's the fight song. <br/>It's time for 
      the cheerleader pyramid <br/>at mid-field. I have to go. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You sure you're okay to go out there? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(sense of duty)<br/>You don't understand, I have to go. 
      <br/>I'm the apex.</p></p></center>
<p>A re-energized Cordelia grabs her pompoms and springs out of the room, 
      leaving Buffy alone. After a beat-- 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(calls out)<br/>I know what you're trying to do, 
      <br/>Chris... you and Eric...</center>
<p>A beat. Nothing. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I know about the bodies from the<br/>cemetery. 
      But you haven't hurt anyone <br/>yet, you can still do the right 
      <br/>thing... </center>
<p>Finally, Chris steps from behind the row of lockers. 
      <p>Buffy sees him. He looks so small at the moment. So tortured. He 
      doesn't make eye contact with Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Listen, I don't know what it's like <br/>to lose 
      someone close to you like<br/>your brother, but I know what you're 
      <br/>trying to do is wrong. 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>I have to do it for him... He needs <br/>someone... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Who, Eric? He needs industrial <br/>strength therapy. 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>He always looked out for me... stood <br/>up for me... he's all 
      alone... <br/>everybody loved him and now he's all <br/>alone... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Who are you --</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She stops.

<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Oh my God.</center>

      touch and go whether Eric will survive. 
      <p>
<center>ERIC (cont'd)<br/>Your brother's not the only one who <br/>can 
      create life... what do you say...?</center>

      <p>GILES<br/>Well, I do find it odd that a nation <br/>that prides itself on 
      its virility <br/>feels compelled to strap on forty <br/>pounds of 
      protective gear just to <br/>play rugby. 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>(surprised)<br/>Is this your normal strategy for 
      a<br/>first date: dissing my country's <br/>national pastime? 
      <p>GILES<br/>(a beat, then)<br/>Did you say... "date"? 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>(smiles)<br/>You noticed that, huh?</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>But before the silly, schoolboy grin has a chance to spread all the way 
      across Giles' face-- 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (O.S.) <br/>Hi, Ms. Calendar. Hey, Giles.</center>
<p>Hey, look. Willow and Xander have joined us! 
      <p>
<center>MS. CALENDAR <br/>Hi, guys. What's up? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Buffy get back yet? 
      <p>GILES<br/>No.<br/>(hinting)<br/>But perhaps you should circulate down 
      <br/>nearer the field to find her. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Eric's was a bust. Nothing there. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(looks around) <br/>Yeah, nothing but a lot of computer 
      <br/>equipment and a pornography <br/>collection so prodigious it even 
      <br/>scared me.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>And, to Giles' chagrin, Xander and Willow settle in for the duration. 
      It's become a date with children. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>So... what's the score?</center>
<p>STRANGE NEW ANGLE ON: THE FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT 
      <p>At ground level. The SOUNDS of the CROWD, the BANDS, the REFEREES' 
      WHISTLES and the GRUNTING and TACKLING of the PLAYERS are strangely muted 
      here as we look out beyond the CHEERLEADERS and BENCHWARMERS to the 
      excitement of the game just beyond. We are-- 
      <p>UNDER THE BLEACHERS OF THE FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT 
      <p>In the dark and shadowy web of metal crossbeams that stripe the cavity 
      below the thousands of SPECTATORS. 
      <p>Daryl watches the High School football game through the slotted 
      openings and legs of the paying FANS above. 
      <p>He's mesmerized by the deja vu sights and sounds of the stadium. This 
      used to be his world. He drinks in every sensory image. 
      <p>There's a Phantom of the Opera quality to his reaction. 
      <p>REVERSE ANGLE: ON THE CHEERLEADERS - NIGHT 
      <p>As they face the bleachers, urging the home team on. 
      <p>At the end of the cheer, Cordelia crosses to a cooler near the edge of 
      the bleachers and draws a paper cup of water. 
      <p>Daryl GRABS her, jerking her into the dark below the stands. 
      <p>Her SCREAM is absorbed by the CHEER of the stadium full of people as 
      the Razorbacks score a touchdown on the field. 
      <p>EXT. BY THE STANDS - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and Chris move quickly toward the far end, where the Sunnydale 
      Cheerleaders are finishing a post-touchdown cheer. 
      <p>But as they draw near, it becomes apparent that Cordelia is not among 
      the leaping and cheering squad. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I don't see her. Do you?</center>
<p>
<div align="center">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. LAB (OLD SCIENCE BUILDING) - NIGHT 
      <p>The gutted room with boarded up windows still bears the carbon streaks 
      from the fire a year earlier. 
      <p>The sheet-draped Body is now joined by a second table. Cordelia 
      (blindfolded) is thrown on it by Daryl. Eric straps her in immediately. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Please... what's going on... take off<br/>the 
      blindfold, I won't scream, I<br/>promise... 
      <p>DARYL (O.S.)<br/>She's beautiful...</p></center>
<p>Eric turns to see Daryl, his back to Cordelia, lifting the sheet to 
      check out the inanimate, piecemeal body. 
      <p>
<center>ERIC<br/>No! It's bad luck for the groom to<br/>see the bride before 
      the wedding.</center>
<p>Eric hastily crosses to Daryl. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Please... just take off the<br/>blindfold, I promise I 
      won't -- 
      <p>DARYL<br/>Cordelia...</p></center>
<p>Daryl removes the blindfold. Cordelia takes one look at him and screams 
      bloody murder. 
      <p>
<center>ERIC<br/>You can scream all you want - we're<br/>in an abandoned 
      building...<br/>(scream continues; he<br/>picks up a 
      blunt<br/>object)<br/>okay, that's enough. </center>
<p>Daryl just looks at Cordelia with his sad, mangled eyes. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL<br/>You were always good to me. Always <br/>noticed me, but I 
      ignored you. I'm <br/>sorry. I'm glad that I got this <br/>second chance to 
      tell you that. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(stunned)<br/>D-Daryl...? 
      <p>DARYL<br/>I was thoughtless, I know that now. <br/>But I've changed, I've 
      learned to <br/>appreciate how much it meant that you<br/>wanted to be with 
      me. 
      <p>ERIC<br/>We're ready. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Ready? Ready for what?! 
      <p>ERIC<br/>You're going to feel a little pinch, <br/>maybe a little 
      discomfort around the <br/>neck area. But when you wake up, <br/>you'll have 
      the body of a seventeen <br/>year old. In fact...</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Eric lifts the sheet so that Cordelia can see the Body on the adjacent 
      table. (We're angled so we can't however.) 
      <p>
<center>ERIC (cont'd)<br/>...you'll have the body of several.</center>
<p>EXT. STADIUM BLEACHERS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy runs right behind the cheerleaders to Cordelia's place. She spots 
      the two POMPOMS lying on the ground several feet away at the edge of the 
      bleachers... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>He was here. Chris, where did he <br/>take her? 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>To the rest of the body. To the lab. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Where is that? 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>I promised him... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He'll kill Cordelia.<br/>(desperate)<br/>You can't just give and 
      take lives <br/>like that. It's not your job.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Chris looks up at Buffy. This hits home. 
      <p>
<center>CHRIS<br/>Please try not to hurt him. He's in <br/>the old science 
      building. Everything<br/>is set up there. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay, find Willow and Xander and Mr. <br/>Giles. Tell them 
      what's going on.</p></center>
<p>Buffy heads off. Chris watches her for a beat, worried about his 
      brother, then moves off. 
      <p>INT. LAB (OLD SCIENCE BUILDING) - NIGHT 
      <p>Eric finishes pouring gas from a five gallon drum into the generator. 
      He turns on the generator. All around the room, jerry- rigged machines hum 
      to life. Eric holds a surgical saw over a bunsen burner. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Daryl, please... you don't have to <br/>do this. 
      <p>DARYL<br/>I have to. So we can be together. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(frantic now)<br/>We can be together anyway. I'll be 
      <br/>with you. I promise.</p></p></center>
<p>He leans in to Cordelia. She can't help looking away. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL<br/>Is that right? You see anything you <br/>like?</center>
<p>He turns away, to the unfinished girl. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL (cont'd)<br/>When you're finished, you won't go <br/>out. You 
      won't go away. We'll hide <br/>together.</center>
<p>Tears start to flow down Cordelia's face. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Please...</center>
<p>Eric pulls the shiny surgical saw out of the flame, steps forward. 
      <p>
<center>ERIC<br/>Sterile enough for government work...</center>
<p>He lowers the blade towards Cordelia's neck. Cordelia SCREAMS. 
      <p>Just as the door CRASHES open and Buffy steps inside. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Buffy! Help me!</center>
<p>As Buffy looks down at Cordelia, Eric heaves the surgical saw across at 
      her. Buffy neatly catches it by the handle in midair. 
      <p>Eric, ever the coward, flees into a corner, ducking. Buffy ignores him, 
      turns to Daryl 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Daryl, listen, I know who you are. <br/>Your brother sent 
      me to stop this. 
      <p>DARYL<br/>He wouldn't do that. He loves me. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Buffy, they're crazy! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's okay, Cordelia, I'm getting you <br/>out of here. 
      <p>DARYL<br/>No, I'm not finished with her.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Daryl picks up another blade from the surgical tray, starts toward 
      Cordelia. Buffy runs, somersaults over the table with the Body, kicking 
      Daryl back and away from Cordelia. 
      <p>He's up again in an instant. He punches Buffy hard - she goes back into 
      the gurney, sends it rolling across the room. 
      <p>It hits the gas can and generator -- the can topples, spilling gas. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Buffy! 
      <p>DARYL<br/>I won't live alone!</p></center>
<p>At that moment, Eric makes a break for the door. Daryl grabs him by the 
      scruff of the neck. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL (cont'd)<br/>You have to help me! 
      <p>ERIC<br/>Let go!</p></center>
<p>Furious, Daryl hurls Eric into the wall by the door, knocking him 
      unconscious. 
      <p>Buffy starts toward Cordelia again, but Daryl lunges at her. 
      <p>She catches him with a roundhouse kick that sends him reeling. He plows 
      into a table, knocking the bunsen burner to the ground. 
      <p>ANGLE: THE POOL OF GAS 
      <p>As the bunsen burner flame ignites it, setting a fire in the middle of 
      the room. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Buffy!</center>
<p>Xander runs in, susses the sitch. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Get Cordelia!</center>
<p>He goes to the gurney, skirting around the flames. He starts to untie 
      Cordelia -- 
      <p>Daryl grabs a huge bottle of chemicals and hurls it at Buffy. She ducks 
      but the chemicals hit the wall and burst into flame, creating a wall of 
      fire, cutting Xander and Cordelia off from the door. 
      <p>Buffy rains blows on Daryl 
      <p>ANGLE: THE DOOR 
      <p>The rest of the group arrive. They react to the carnage and flames. No 
      way can they get to Xander and Cordelia on the gurney. Willow and Giles 
      pull the unconscious Eric out of the room. 
      <p>Xander looks around, thinking. He grabs the gurney, gives it a massive 
      shove-- 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>No!</center>
<p>--then dives on top of Cordelia as the table rolls back through the 
      wall of flames (saving her life) and to the door with Giles and the 
      others. 
      <p>
<center>MS. CALENDAR<br/>Buffy, get out!</center>
<p>But Daryl strikes again, knocking her against a wall. He picks up a 
      student desk, to bash Buffy's head with, when-- 
      <p>
<center>CHRIS<br/>Daryl! Don't!</center>
<p>Daryl looks across at his brother standing in the doorway. Looks down 
      at Buffy, some remaining human instinct preventing him from unloading the 
      desk. 
      <p>Then he looks across through the fire to see the flames whirling up 
      around the sheet covered Body. He freaks. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL<br/>No! She's mine!</center>
<p>Daryl barrels into the fire, which quickly engulfs him as he falls onto 
      the sheet-covered Body to shield it from the flames. 
      <p>
<center>DARYL (cont'd)<br/>Mine! 
      <p>CHRIS<br/>Daryl!</p></center>
<p>Chris bolts toward his brother, but Buffy grabs him, wraps him up, 
      holds him back. 
      <p>ANGLE ON: THE FLAMES 
      <p>As the photo chemicals fuel the conflagration to greater intensity. 
      Daryl is draped over the Body, motionless now as the fire engulfs them. 
      <p>
<div align="center">DISSOLVE TO:</div>
<p>EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - LATER - NIGHT 
      <p>We see most of the combatants, bathed in fire trucks' flashing lights. 
      The fire seems to be over by now. 
      <p>ANGLE: CHRIS AND BUFFY 
      <p>Are staring at the old science building together. After a time... 
      <p>
<center>CHRIS<br/>The first time he woke up, after... <br/>he said I 
      shouldn't have brought him <br/>back. I was just trying to look out <br/>for 
      him. Like he would have done for <br/>me.</center>
<p>Buffy decides against saying anything. Just puts her hand on his 
      shoulder. 
      <p>Angel approaches, goes up to Buffy, concerned. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>I saw the fire, figured you'd be <br/>here. Is everyone 
      okay? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. We're okay.</p></center>
<p>ANGLE ON GILES AND MS. CALENDAR: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I am sorry about all this. 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>That's okay. Although a good rule of <br/>thumb for a 
      first date is don't do <br/>anything so exciting that it will be <br/>hard 
      to top on the second date. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(ruefully)<br/>Believe it or not, since I've moved <br/>here to 
      live on top of the Hellmouth, <br/>the events of this evening actually 
      <br/>qualify as a slow night.<br/>(stops)<br/>Did you say, "second date"? 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>Ah, you noticed that too?</p></p></p></center>
<p>ANGLE ON: XANDER AND WILLOW 
      <p>As they watch Buffy and Angel, Giles and Ms. Calendar together. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Well, I guess that makes it official. <br/>Everyone's 
      paired off. Vampires can <br/>get dates. Hell, even the school 
      <br/>librarian is seeing more action than <br/>me.<br/>(shakes his 
      head)<br/>You ever feel like the world is a <br/>giant game of musical 
      chairs, and the<br/>music has stopped and you're the only <br/>one who 
      doesn't have a chair?</center>
<p>Cordelia steps up behind the two, summons her nerve. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>All the time. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Xander, I, uh, just wanted to say <br/>thanks for saving my 
      life in there. <br/>It was... really brave and heroic and <br/>all. And if 
      there's ever anything I <br/>can do to repay you... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Do you mind? We're talking here.</p></p></center>
<p>Cordelia reacts, turns and crossing off. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>(to Willow)<br/>So, where were we? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Wondering why we never seem to have <br/>dates. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Oh, yeah. So, why do you think that <br/>is?</p></p></center>
<p>EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and Angel walk along together. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>The whole thing was creepy. But at <br/>the same time... I 
      mean, he did do it <br/>all for his brother... 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Sounds like he took it a little over <br/>the edge. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Love makes you do the wacky... 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>The what? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Crazy stuff. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Oh. Crazy like a 241 year old being <br/>jealous of a high 
      school junior? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(charmed) <br/>Are you fessing up? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>I thought about it. Maybe he bothers <br/>me a little.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy turns, close to Angel. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I don't love Xander. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>But he's in your life. He gets to be <br/>there when I can't. 
      Take your <br/>classes, eat your meals, hear your<br/>jokes and complaints. 
      He gets to see <br/>you in the sunlight. 
      <p>BUFFY <br/>I don't look all that great in direct<br/>light...</p></p></center>
<p>He half-smiles at that, looks out into the sky a moment. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>It'll be morning soon. I should 
      <br/>probably...<br/>(motions: go) 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>...yeah. I've got things to...</p></center>
<p>She looks up at him for a beat. A little despair coursing through both 
      of them. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I could walk you home...</center>
<p>He holds out his hand. She takes it. They walk off. 
      <p>The camera holds them a while, until a headstone comes into the 
      foreground and we focus on that, the camera finally settling. The 
      headstone reads: 
      <p>DARYL EPPS 
      <p>1978 - 1996 
      <p>REST IN PEACE 
      <p>
