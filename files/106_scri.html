<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. MAGIC BOX - DAY (DAY 1) 
      <p>A banner tacked to the front counter reads "Halloween Bonanza!'! The 
      magic box is packed with customers (some in costume) clamoring for goodies 
      and decorations. Giles, Dawn, Willow, Tara, and Xander are helping Anya 
      with the crush. Anya, adorned in short shorts, a tee, excessively 
      feathered hair and roller skates, zips around like General Retail on 
      wheels. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>(to customer)<br/>Everything on this table's half off! 
      <br/>Including the table!<br/>(to another customer)<br/>Buy one eyeball, get 
      the second one<br/>free!</center>
<p>ON XANDER 
      <p>in full pirate regalia, including an eye patch. Xander's currently 
      explaining a jar of fire to a group of kids. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(pirate voice)<br/>Arhhh! Careful, me mateys! These 
      be<br/>fire flies spat from a volcano off<br/>the coast of Katmandu. Arhhh! 
      <p>CHUNKY KID<br/>You're not a real pirate. Real<br/>pirates live on boats 
      and don't look<br/>stupid. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Arhhh! A salty swab, eh? Maybe you<br/>be fishin' for a 
      taste... of me hook!</p></p></center>
<p>Xander thrusts his hand up at the kids. Sure enough, he's wearing a 
      fake pirate's hook. The kids squeal, including Chunky. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Hello! Ahab! A little help? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(pirate voice)<br/>And help ye shall have! Arhhh!</p></center>
<p>Xander moves over to assist Giles at the swamped register. Giles is 
      decked out in his opening day wizard robe from Season 5, sans hat. Xander, 
      Giles, and Anya are the only one of our Gang in costume. Anya skates past 
      with Dawn following alongside. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>So what are you supposed to be? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>An angel. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Oh. Shouldn't you have wings? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>This is a special kind of angel,<br/>called a "Charlie". We 
      don't have<br/>wings. We just skate around with<br/>perfect hair, fighting 
      crime.<br/>Where's your costume? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Like I'm six years old. Halloween's<br/>so lame. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>But you get to dress up and play<br/>games! Xander's gonna teach 
      me a new<br/>one after work called Shiver Me<br/>Timbers. You ever play? 
      <p>TARA<br/>(swooping in)<br/>Dawn, Willow could use some help in<br/>magical 
      texts. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(scampering off, relieved)<br/>I'm all over it. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>What about you? Ever play Shiver Me<br/>Timbers? 
      <p>TARA<br/>Not really much for the timber.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>ON WILLOW 
      <p>arguing with a woman dressed as a classic ugly witch. Willow punctuates 
      her words with a Remedial Witchcraft book. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>All I'm saying is you might want to<br/>rethink the 
      stereotype before someone<br/>turns <u>you</u> into a toad.</center>
<p>Witch Woman snatches the book out of her hand and huffs off. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>While you're at it, try pulling 
      that<br/>broomstick out of your -- Dawn! 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Don't stop the invective on account<br/>of me. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>If I see one more idiot that thinks<br/>witches are all hairy 
      moles and<br/>rotten teeth...</p></p></center>
<p>A LITTLE GIRL walks up in a witchy-poo outfit, wearing a mask adorned 
      with hairy moles and a grin crammed with rotten teeth. 
      <p>
<center>WITCHY-POO<br/>Do you have candy corn?</center>
<p>Willow instantly bursts into a huge smile. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Aw, look at you! Aren't you just the<br/>cutest little 
      thing! 
      <p>DAWN<br/>But I thought you said -- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I know, but -- look, with the nose<br/>and the hat and -- 
      aww!<br/>(to Witchy-poo)<br/>Come on. Let's fill that tummy up<br/>with 
      sugary nibblets! </p></p></center>
<p>Willow leads her off. Dawn watches her in disbelief -- until a gold 
      coin with a serpent crest catches her eye on a table next to her. She 
      glances around and furtively slips it into her pocket. She shifts into 
      extra innocent as Anya zips past. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Buffy, we're running low on Mandrake<br/>root. Check the 
      basement!</center>
<p>Buffy is just coming out of the back room carrying a box brimming with 
      Magic Box oddities. She frowns sourly at the basement door. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Okay, but don't blame me if we have<br/>this same 
      conversation over and...</center>
<p>INT. MAGIC BOX - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy comes down the stairs. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>... over and over and --</center>
<p>She hits the landing, turns -- and nearly runs into Spike. She gasps, 
      glares. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Bell. Neck. Look into it.</center>
<p>Buffy moves over to the shelves. Spike follows her. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Come with a nice leather collar, does <br/>it? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What are you doing lurking down here? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Why does everyone always think I'm<br/>lurking about? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't know. Could it have<br/>something to do with <u>the 
      lurking</u>?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike holds up a handful of vile looking weeds. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Came through the tunnels. Running<br/>low on Burba weed. 
      Stir it in with<br/>the blood, makes it all hot and spicy.</center>
<p>Buffy stares at him, a mixture of disgust and disinterest. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>What, I was gonna pay for it. I<br/>mean, no, I 
      was gonna nick it.<br/>'Cause that's what I do.<br/>I go where I please and 
      take what I<br/>want and what's your excuse anyway?<br/>Thought you had it 
      to the brim with<br/>customer disservice. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>One time deal to help out. And I<br/>mean straight time -- no 
      loop de loop<br/>mummy hand repeato vision. Where's<br/>the Mandrake 
      root?</p></center>
<p>Spike takes a bottle of misshapen, almost human looking mandrake root 
      from a top shelf, hands it to her. They're close to each other, the air 
      suddenly charged between them. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Three to a jar. They tend to go a<br/>bit wonky if you 
      cram 'em too close. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Thanks. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Feel like a bit of the rough and<br/>tumble? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(surprised)<br/>What? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Me. You. Patrolling? Hello? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(relieved)<br/>Oh, uh... I should stay. These<br/>Mandrake roots 
      aren't gonna get up<br/>the stairs themselves. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Might if you let them out. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Maybe tomorrow night, okay? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(playing it off)<br/>Not like I don't already have 
      plans.<br/>Great Pumpkin's on in twenty.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Off he goes. Buffy sighs as she heads up the stairs. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>So much easier to talk to when he<br/>just wanted to kill 
      me.</center>
<p>INT. MAGIC BOX - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
      <p>The noise of the crowd assaults Buffy as she reenters. She grimaces, 
      overwhelmed. Anya skates past, snatching the bottle of Mandrake root from 
      her. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Go help Giles!</center>
<p>Giles is hip deep in customers at the cash register. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What happened to Xander? 
      <p>GILES<br/>(ringing up customers)<br/>He kept poking me with his hook. 
      I<br/>sent him over to charmed objects.<br/>With any luck he'll poke the 
      wrong<br/>one and end up in a parallel<br/>dimension inhabited by a 
      fifty-foot<br/>Giles who squashes annoying, 
      teeny<br/>pirates.<br/>(indicating customers)<br/>We've got a ton of bagging 
      here. If<br/>you could start over here and - 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Actually, Spike had this really good<br/>idea about patrolling 
      -- 
      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy, you've been out patrolling<br/>every night this week. 
      Besides, it's<br/>Halloween. The one time a year<br/>supernatural threats 
      give it a well-<br/>deserved rest. As should you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But what about costumes taking over<br/>your personality or wee 
      little Irish<br/>fear demony thingies? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes, well, if anything calamitous is<br/>going to happen 
      tonight, history<br/>suggests it will happen to us. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So maybe I should patrol to <u>avoid</u><br/>trouble and 
      -<br/>(sags)<br/>I'm bagging.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She snaps open a bag and wades into the job. 
      <p>EXT. STREET/KALTENBACH'S HOUSE - DAY 4 
      <p>The sun is sinking. Children in costume are already out making their 
      candy rounds. KALTENBACH, a crusty old man in a crusty old suit, ambles 
      down the sidewalk with a grocery bag, softly humming "Pop Goes the 
      Weasel." 
      <p>He reaches his dilapidated house, the kind of spooky, rundown two-story 
      faux Victorian job that every town has. He ambles up to the rickety front 
      porch, passing signs that warn <u>Keep Off Lawn</u> and <u>No 
      Soliciting</u>! 
      <p>INT. KALTENBACH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
      <p>The inside of his house is a cavernous, shadowy affair filled with 
      creepy taxidermy and musty old toys from the 5Os. Santa Claus via Norman 
      Bates. Kaltenbach ambles into the kitchen, still humming "Pop Goes the 
      Weasel." 
      <p>INT. KALTENBACH'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
      <p>Kaltenbach is cooking. A huge pot boils on the stove. CHILDREN SCREAM 
      from outside. He peeks out the window, eyeing a group of kids in costume 
      running down the street, laughing and screaming. He chuckles, softly 
      singing his own version of "Pop Goes the Weasel" as he returns to his 
      cooking. 
      <p>
<center>KALTENBACH<br/>Da da da da da-da-da-da, happy<br/>Hallowe-en, Give 
      you something<br/>special this year, da da da-da da!</center>
<p>He pulls a gleaming BUTCHER KNIFE from a creaky old drawer. It catches 
      the light and gleams. The schmuck be baited.

      <p>Dawn ushers the last customer out. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(brightly)<br/>Come again...</center>
<p>She flips the CLOSED sign and sags against the door. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>in a zillion years.</center>
<p>The store looks like the aftermath of a battle. The gang's sprawled on 
      chairs and draped over counters. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Store go boom.<br/>(weak pirate voice)<br/>Arh. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(a bit choked up)<br/>That was... that was the 
      most<br/>incredible thing I have ever<br/>experienced.</p></center>
<p>Xander frowns at her. The <u>most</u> incredible? 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>(to Xander)<br/>Except for that.<br/>(to 
      gang)<br/>What you all did for me tonight, the<br/>astounding heaps of money 
      you helped<br/>me - -</center>
<p>Giles clears his throat. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>You helped <u>us</u> acquire. All I can 
      say<br/>is... I hope we make as much tomorrow! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Tomorrow? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Post holiday clearance! The<br/>cornerstone of retail!</p></p></center>
<p>The gang groans. Giles wearily rises. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Brooms all around, then? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Or I could whip up a jaunty self-<br/>cleaning incantation. 
      It'll be just<br/>like Fantasia. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes, and we all know how splendidly<br/>that turned out for 
      Mickey.</p></p></center>
<p>He hands her a broom and dust pan, moves off. Willow grumbles. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Think I'm a little more adept than a cartoon mouse. 
      <p>TARA<br/>(lightly)<br/>And you have more fingers. Which is<br/>good, cause 
      -- hey, no need to wear<br/>those big white gloves 
      to<br/>overcompensate.</p></center>
<p>Buffy is wearily straightening up the war table with Xander. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You know if you had a real peg leg,<br/>you wouldn't just 
      have a lame <br/>costume. You'd actually be lame,<br/>which is a whole 
      other--</center>
<p>She turns to Xander, but his attention's focused on Anya. She's behind 
      the cash register with wads of cash in each hand, doing the shimmy and 
      shake with Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(dancing, giggling) <br/>You do this every night? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>After I close out the register. The<br/>dance of capitalist 
      superiority!</p></center>
<p>Xander raises his eye patch so he can take Anya in with two good 
      peepers. He's totally, completely smitten. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(soft - to himself)<br/>I'm gonna marry that girl. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(flustered) <br/>Xander! She's fifteen! And my <br/>sister, so 
      don't even --<br/>(suddenly getting it)<br/>Oh. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Hey, everybody! Can I, uh, there's<br/>something Anya and I 
      want to tell you. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(shocked)<br/><u>Now</u>? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Now.<br/>(deep breath)<br/>We're getting married. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Oh my God! 
      <p>TARA<br/>Congratulations! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That's -- that's... wow.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander takes Anya in, mesmerized. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Big wow. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(tears starting)<br/>I thought you were waiting for the<br/>right 
      moment? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I did.</p></p></center>
<p>He sweeps her into his arms and plants a serious Clark Gable on her. It 
      takes her breath away. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>(swooning, to Dawn) <br/>Here, have some money.</center>
<p>She hands Dawn the cash in her hand, then goes back to the deep 
      kissing. Buffy whispers to Giles. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Did you know about this? 
      <p>GILES<br/>No. Unless I blocked it from my<br/>memory, much as I will 
      Xander's<br/>vigorous use of his tongue.</p></center>
<p>Giles takes off his glasses, cleans them. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Is that why you're always cleaning<br/>your glasses? So 
      you don't have to<br/>see what we're doing? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Reveal my secret to no one.</p></center>
<p>Buffy stares in disbelief at the lip-locked couple. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Giles, this is -- We have to do<br/>something...</center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Music blares. An impromptu engagement party is in full swing. Anya and 
      Xander are still in their costumes. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>...and he said he couldn't imagine<br/>the rest of his life 
      without me and<br/>then he gave me this!</center>
<p>Anya proudly displays her engagement ring on her finger. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Which I'll be paying for the rest of<br/>my life with 
      her. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Can I try it on?

<p>Buffy and Giles appear from the kitchen with drinks. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Where I come from this sort of thing<br/>requires much in 
      the way of libation. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(taking a drink)<br/>God save the Queen! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Sorry we couldn't do the big fancy.<br/>You kind of caught us 
      with our<br/>parties down. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>That's all right. This is just the<br/>first premarital 
      celebration. We'll<br/>have lots more. With gifts! 
      <p>TARA<br/>(laughs)<br/>Sure. Maybe we'll even have time to<br/>decorate for

<p>Willow waves her hand. The house is suddenly decorated with Japanese 
      ribbons and paper lanterns. Anya beams. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>This is so much better than the way<br/>it usually looks. 
      Thank you!</center>
<p>She hugs Willow. Tara catches Giles' look of concern. Was that bit of 
      conjuring really necessary? 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
      <p>Tara is helping Willow refill the chip bowl. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>(tentatively)<br/>The grocery store's still open. 
      We<br/>could have bought decorations. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Why bother? These are perfect -- and<br/>extra biodegradeably. 
      In a couple of<br/>hours -- poof! 
      <p>TARA<br/>No, they're -- they're great.<br/>(a beat)<br/>It's just... why 
      use magic when you<br/>can do something naturally?</p></p></center>
<p>Willow laughs Tara's concern off. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>You can also fight monsters<br/>"naturally" with sticks 
      and stones.<br/>Don't really recommend it, though. 
      <p>TARA<br/>That's different. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>How? 
      <p>TARA<br/>Because -- because you're protecting<br/>people. Keeping them 
      from being hurt. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Which makes them happy. Like pretty<br/>decorations made Anya 
      happy. 
      <p>TARA<br/>That's not the point, Will. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(exasperated)<br/>Why are you being like this? 
      <p>TARA<br/>This isn't about me. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>This is so about you. You're always<br/>coming down on me for 
      doing magic<br/>that couldn't hurt a fly. What's<br/>your problem? 
      <p>TARA<br/>Willow, I j-just want you to stop and<br/>think about what 
      you're --</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Tara spots Dawn standing in the doorway, stops. She's obviously heard 
      what they're arguing about. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Sorry. Just checking on the chips. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It's okay. We're done.</p></center>
<p>Willow takes the chip bowl and exits with Dawn. Tara sags. Yep, that 
      went well. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy has Xander in a big Slayer-powered hug. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You're getting married. <u>You</u>. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(grimacing)<br/>Me. Choking. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Seems like just yesterday you<br/>couldn't pay a girl to date 
      you. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Like I'd ever pay -- Define "date".</p></p></p></center>
<p>Mixed emotions swirl across Buffy's face. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I'm out of commission for three<br/>months and you... How 
      many other<br/>things have changed since I've been<br/>away?</center>
<p>Dawn and Willow enter. Dawn munches from the chip bowl. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>I got a tattoo. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(livid)<br/>What?! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>And that's why we told her she<br/>couldn't. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Just a little one? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Over my dead body. The kind that<br/>doesn't come back. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Fine.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She kisses Xander on the cheek. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Congratulations.<br/>(to Anya)<br/>You're so lucky, 
      finding a guy like<br/>him. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Almost as lucky as me.</p></center>
<p>Xander gives Anya a soft kiss. Buffy can't help but feel a little 
      envious of their happiness. Dawn grabs her sweater. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>See you guys tomorrow. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Tomorrow? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Yeah. I'm spending the night at<br/>Janice's, remember? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Wait -- that's tonight? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>No, it's on the other Halloween.<br/>Come on, you said I could. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, okay, I know, but now with<br/>Xander's party -- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>We're good. But you'll have to cough<br/>up extra gifts at the 
      reception. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Yes, please! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't know. Giles. . .? 
      <p>GILES<br/>It's really not up to me. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Come on. It's four blocks. I'll<br/>walk straight over. Not like 
      I'm<br/>gonna be roaming the streets. Please?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Filled with Trick or Treaters and partiers in costume. Dawn roams the 
      street, all satisfied smiles. She slips down an alley, taking a shortcut. 
      <p>EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn traipses merrily down the alley, but her smile drops as she hears 
      a disembodied MOAN further down. She peers into the gloom. Spooky spooky 
      schmuck bait. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Hello?</center>
<p>She inches forward. The MOAN sounds again. It's coming from behind some 
      stacked barrels concealed in the shadows. Dawn picks up a scrap of wood to 
      use as a club. She inches up around the barrels -- and gasps. Two costumed 
      teens are necking heavy. 
      <p>
<center>GUY<br/>Hey! 
      <p>GIRL<br/>(buttoning shirt)<br/>Perv! 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(backing away)<br/>Sorry! I thought, uh --</p></p></center>
<p>WHAM! Something grabs Dawn from behind. She yelps, whirls around. It's 
      JANICE. Fifteen, long dark hair like Dawn, and the perpetual twinkle of 
      impending mischief in her eyes. 
      <p>
<center>JANICE<br (laughing?)<br=""/>Hey, Summers. Get an eyeful of 
      the<br/>grope-fest? Maybe you are a perv. 
      <p>DAWN<br be="" i?d="" like="" losers<br="" those="" two="" watching=""/>if I were. 
      <p>GIRL<br/>(O.S.)<br/>Bite me! 
      <p>JANICE<br/>You get over the wall okay. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Yeah. My sister thinks I'm staying<br/>at your house. 
      <p>JANICE<br/>The Mominator thinks I'm at yours.<br/>Can't believe they fell 
      for that one.<br/>Like, own a TV? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(laughs)<br/>So where are we meeting? 
      <p>JANICE<br/>The park.<br/>(spooky voice)<br/>That's where all the monsters 
      gather<br/>on Halloween...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT. PARK - NIGHT 
      <p>THRASH MUSIC blares from a boom box. ZACK, 17, is standing on a swing, 
      hooting as he arcs higher and higher. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>Hoo hoo hoo! To infinity and -- </center>
<p>WHACK! An empty soda can bonks him in the head. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK (cont'd)<br/>Ow!</center>
<p>ANGLE ON JUSTIN, also 17, all American cute with a killer smile. 
      Definite air of James Dean, down to the black work boots, jeans, and 
      leather jacket -- which is pretty much standard issue for him and his 
      rowdy friends MARLA, CHRISTY, and GLENN. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>Oops. 
      <p>JANICE<br/>(O.S.)<br/>Nice shot.</p></center>
<p>Zack spots Janice and Dawn walking up. He leaps off the swing and grabs 
      Janice into a big hug. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>Hey, baby! What took ya? 
      <p>JANICE<br/>Had to stop for crimes and<br/>misdemeanors.</p></center>
<p>She kisses the spot where the soda can hit his forehead. 
      <p>
<center>JANICE (cont'd)<br/>Zack, this is my friend Dawn I was<br/>telling 
      you about.</center>
<p>Zack gives Dawn the roving eye. Yowza! 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>Hell-o!</center>
<p>Janice slugs him in the shoulder. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK (cont'd)<br/>Ow!</center>
<p>Justin sidles up. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>Hey. Justin.</center>
<p>He shakes her hand with a shy grin. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(nervous)<br/>I know. I've seen you around at a<br/>couple 
      of parties.</center>
<p>He takes Dawn in with a warm, shy smile. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>I've seen you too.</center>
<p>Dawn practically blushes to death. Justin and Zack's friends yell over 
      as they move off. 
      <p>
<center>GLENN<br/>Hey, catch you guys later! 
      <p>ZACK<br/>Alone at last. 
      <p>JANICE<br/>So what do you want to do?</p></p></center>
<p>Justin and Zack look at each other, break out into huge grins. They 
      know just the thing... 
      <p>EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Smash! An egg splatters the face of a witch cutout adorning a front 
      porch. Zack is hucking eggs at the house. Janice stands next to him, 
      looking bored. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>Yeah! Three-points! Whoo!</center>
<p>ON JUSTIN 
      <p>letting the air out of the tires of an SUV parked out front. Dawn 
      stands nervously keeping lookout. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Witches don't really look like that. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>(laughs)<br/>Got a lot of witch friends? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>No, I mean, from what I've read and<br/>stuff. Some of them are 
      supposed to<br/>be really pretty, and boy you don't<br/>want to get them 
      mad, 'cause --</p></p></center>
<p>Zack zips past. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>New target! Come on!</center>
<p>Justin takes off after Zack. Janice and Dawn follow. 
      <p>
<center>JANICE<br/>So? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(downplaying)<br/>He's okay. 
      <p>JANICE<br/>"Ho hum" okay or "oh-my-god-I'm-gonna-<br/>pee-my-pants" okay? 

      <p>DAWN<br/>(bursting)<br/>Pee!</p></p></p></center>
<p>They burst out into giggles. 
      <p>ON JUSTIN AND ZACK 
      <p>walking up ahead. Zack kicks over a mailbox as they go. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>So what's the verdict, cap'n?<br/>(exaggerated)<br/>Is 
      wittle Justin in love?</center>
<p>Justin gives Zack a playful shove 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>I don't know. She's cute. 
      <p>ZACK<br/>Congratulations for having eyeballs.<br/>But what about, you 
      know -- going all<br/>the way? You think --</p></center>
<p>Janice and Dawn come up behind them. Zack instantly switches gears. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK (cont'd)<br/>(extra innocent)<br/>-- that the moon and the 
      stars look<br/>lovely tonight? 
      <p>JANICE<br/>We done with the juvie crap yet?<br/>'Cause, hey! 
      Bored!</p></center>
<p>Zack stops, his eyes focusing off screen. He grins deviously. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>Just one more.</center>
<p>Dawn and Janice look over. It's Kaltenbach's rundown house, which looks 
      a thousands times more forboding at night. A twisted Jack-o'-lantern sits 
      on the front stoop, a candle inside giving it flickering life. Schmuck 
      bait, anyone? 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Giles is refreshing Xander's drink. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Anya's a wonderful former vengeance<br/>demon. I'm sure 
      you'll enjoy many<br/>years of non-hell dimensional bliss.</center>
<p>Giles hands him his drink. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>So, is she moving in with you? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Uh ... 
      <p>GILES<br/>You know with your combined incomes<br/>you may want to look 
      into a down<br/>payment on a house. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>The kind you live in?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander is starting to feel the pressure. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>No rush. I'm sure you have enough to<br/>think about, what 
      with the wedding<br/>arrangements and such. You have the<br/>rest of your 
      lives to plan the rest<br/>of your lives. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yeah, yeah. Rest of our lives... 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well. If you need any help sorting<br/>through it 
      all...</p></p></center>
<p>Giles clasps Xander's shoulder warmly, clinks glasses, moves off. 
      Xander quickly downs the rest of his drink, the pressure reaching 
      critical. 
      <p>EXT. KALTENBACH'S HOUSE - SIDEWALK - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn, Janice, Zack and Justin stand on the sidewalk outside 
      Kaltenbach's house. 
      <p>
<center>JANICE<br/>No way! You know who lives here? 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Old Man Kaltenbach. 
      <p>ZACK<br/>Crusty old bastard. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Isn't he supposed to be, like, mental? 
      <p>ZACK<br/>Total looney tunes.<br/>(to Janice, ala "Raiders")<br/>Pumpkins. 
      Very dangerous. You go<br/>first. 
      <p>JANICE<br/>Screw that. 
      <p>ZACK<br/>Come on, show us how brave you are.<br/>Let's see those cute 
      little girly<br/>guts! 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Lay off, man. If she doesn't want -- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I'll do it.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They stare at Dawn. She forces up a shaky smile for Justin, wanting to 
      impress him. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>Go, Dawn! 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Look, you don't have to -- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's okay. I want to.</p></p></center>
<p>She eyes the house, swallows hard. She creeps up the shadowy walk, all 
      nerves but trying hard not to show it. She carefully climbs the first step 
      to the porch. Second step... Third step -- CREAK! The step groans loudly. 
      She freezes for a beat, relaxes. No signs of life from inside the house. 
      <p>She continues up onto the porch. Janice, Zack and Justin watch tensely 
      from the sidewalk. Justin is particularly mesmerized by Dawn's audacity. 
      <p>Dawn creeps silently over to the Jack-o'-lantern near the front door. 
      She reaches down, picks it up, hoists it over her head. She turns to the 
      group with a triumphant smile as she prepares to give it the big smash. 
      <p>Justin gives her a thousand-watt grin -- then suddenly his eyes go 
      wide. 
      <p>WHAM! A hand suddenly latches onto Dawn's wrist. Kaltenbach's appeared 
      in the doorway behind her. Dawn yelps, pulls away. The Jack-o'-lantern 
      tumbles to the ground, smashes. Dawn stumbles, falls. Kaltenbach looms 
      over her. 
      <p>
<center>KALTENBACH<br/>Shouldn't oughta mess with those.<br/>Sometimes they 
      bite.</center>
<p>Janice, Zack, and Justin race up. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>Get away from her! 
      <p>ZACK<br/>Don't make me go kung-fu on you, man!</p></center>
<p>Zack throws up his hands in a substandard Bruce Lee. Kaltenbach stares 
      for a beat, then breaks into a toothy grin. 
      <p>
<center>KALTENBACH<br/>Come on in, kids. Got something special<br/>for 
      you.</center>
<p>Kaltenbach ambles back inside his house, leaving the door open. They 
      stare at each other in disbelief. Zack chuckles merrily, sensing an 
      opportunity for some creepy guy laughs. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>Cool! 
      <p>JANICE<br/>We are so <u>not</u> going in there. Dawn,<br/>tell 
      them.</p></center>
<p>Dawn looks to Justin. Justin grins, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. 
      Dawn returns it. For this guy, anything. 
      <p>INT. KALTENBACH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn, Janice, Zack, and Justin are seated in Kaltenbach's extra creepy 
      living room. Kaltenbach stands motionless, half in the shadows. Everyone's 
      on edge -- except Zack, who's loving every creepy second. He eyes 
      Kaltenbach's collection of dusty toys, picks up an old robot monster 
      action figure. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>Dude, where'd you get the cool toys? 
      <p>KALTENBACH<br/>Used to design 'em, back in fifty-<br/>eight. Nothin' I 
      loved more than to<br/>see a child's face light up when he<br/>opened one of 
      mine on a Christmas or<br/>a birthday. I was good. Jeepers, I<br/>was the 
      <u>best</u>.</p></center>
<p>Kaltenbach takes the robot monster from Zack. 
      <p>
<center>KALTENBACH (cont 'd)<br/>Until that thing happened. One<br/>little 
      mistake, and they took it all<br/>away from me. They... they took 
      my<br/>toys.<br/>(brightening)<br/>Time for the treats! Who wants to<br/>help 
      daddy in the kitchen?<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>How 'bout you, Sally?</center>
<p>Dawn tenses. Justin springs up. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>Uh -- Sally's not much for the<br/>cookin'. Why don't I 
      give you a hand? 
      <p>KALTENBACH<br/>Hands are good. Always use more<br/>hands.</p></center>
<p>Kaltenbach ambles into the kitchen. Justin grins at Dawn, gives her a 
      reassuring wink as he follows. 
      <p>
<center>JANICE<br/>Okay, can we get the funk out of here<br/>before Satan 
      Claus stuffs us down a<br/>chimney?</center>
<p>Zack picks up a dusty old Jack-in-the-box, absently cranks the handle. 
      The box croaks out "Pop Goes the Weasel" over the following. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>What, and miss the big treat? That'd<br/>break the old 
      guy's wittle heart.<br/>Assuming it's still beating. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>She's right. We should just get<br/>Justin and go. 
      <p>ZACK<br/>Come on, the dude's a thousand years<br/>old. What's he gonna 
      do? Drown us<br/>in his drool cup?</p></p></center>
<p>POP! Jack shoots out of his box -- minus his head, which has been 
      viciously hacked off. Dawn eyes it apprehensively. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Hey. Where's its head?</center>
<p>INT. KALTENBACH'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
      <p>Kaltenbach is humming "Pop Goes the Weasel" under his breath as he 
      putters around the kitchen. Justin is across the room, getting plates. 
      Kaltenbach picks up his huge butcher knife, grins, turns and -- Justin is 
      now standing right behind him, his face full on VAMP. Justin grins, his 
      fangs glinting.

      <p>Justin clamps his hand over Kaltenbach's mouth and sinks his fangs into 
      his neck. Kaltenbach spasms, knocking a big tray covered in tinfoil to the 
      floor. It's a huge Halloween-decorated Rice Crispie Treat. Kaltenbach was 
      going to use the knife to cut it up. That was the "something special" he 
      was planning for the kids this Halloween. 
      <p>INT. KALTENBACH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn and Janice jump at the sound of the tray hitting the floor in the

<center>JANICE<br/>What the hell was that?</center>
<p>Dawn gets up, creeps over to the kitchen door.

<p>She reaches a hand out to swing the door open. BAM! Justin comes

      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>Let's go! 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What happened?</p></center>
<p>Justin holds up a tattered old wallet.

      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Oh my god oh my god oh my god...</center>
<p>ON JUSTIN AND ZACK 
      <p>bringing up the rear, hanging back. Justin grimaces at the taste in his 
      mouth. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>Dude, that guy was rank! 
      <p>ZACK<br/>Bet a spritz of Dawn'll wash that<br/>right out. So what do you

<p>Zack grins, his eyes sparkling.

      <p>Anya is laying out her future with Xander to the gang. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>... I thought maybe a June wedding,<br/>but then I 
      remembered they always<br/>prompted the largest percentage of<br/>calls for 
      vengeance, so now I'm <br/>leaning towards as soon as damn<br/>possible. 
      Mortal life being so<br/>short, we gotta cram in as much<br/>marital bliss 
      as we can before we<br/>wither and die. There's just so much<br/>to 
      consider. The wedding, new cars,<br/>a house, and babies! You have 
      to<br/>plan for babies or they'll just run<br/>roughshod over your entire 
      existence.</center>
<p>Xander tries desperately not to hyperventilate. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Yeah, gotta decide what to call 'em<br/>before they hit 
      college. 
      <p>GILES<br/>"Rupert" is an exceptionally strong<br/>name. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Yes. If we want our progeny to eat<br/>paste and have their 
      lunch money<br/>stolen. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The important thing is you're happy.<br/>Everything else is 
      thick gravy<br/>goodness.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Anya takes Xander's hand, totally in love. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>I know. I'm the luckiest ex-demon in<br/>the world. To be 
      able to find the<br/>one person in all dimensions that I<br/>was meant to be 
      with... and have<br/>everything work out just the way I<br/>dreamed. How 
      often does the universe<br/>allow that to happen?</center>
<p>She hugs Xander close, not seeing how her words have hit Buffy right in 
      the Angel parallel. Buffy and Xander eye each other, both feeling the need 
      to escape.

      <p>BUFFY<br/>But it's a good thing, right? This<br/>is love and celebration 
      and moving<br/>forward. Anya's right. This is the<br/>way life's supposed to 
      work out.</p></center>
<p>She musters up a weak smile. Everything she just described is exactly 
      what her life isn't. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Right. Deep pools of ooey delight.<br/>I'm wallowing. Not 
      drowning. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Definite wallow action.</p></center>
<p>Xander takes a deep breath, rises. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Okay. Once more into the breach? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>My breaches are wearing a little<br/>thin. Think maybe I'll 
      swing by<br/>Spike's, take him up on that patrol.<br/>Gotta be something out 
      there trolling<br/>for a smackdown.</p></center>
<p>EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn and Justin are walking by themselves. Justin rummages through 
      Kaltenbach's wallet. Dawn is flush with excitement. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>So, you're like what, a sophomore? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I wish. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>(mock pain)<br/>Ouhh! Freshman! 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Yep. Way down there at the bottom of<br/>the rung. Actually 
      kinda down under<br/>those little rubber feet that keep<br/>the ladder 
      steady. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Those are important.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Justin takes the cash out of the wallet, offers Dawn half. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN (cont'd)<br/>Here. Spoils of war. You earned it. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I did? 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Yeah. For keeping me steady.</p></p></center>
<p>He smiles shyly. If this kid weren't a vamp, we'd be rooting for these 
      two to hook up. Dawn returns the smile, takes the cash. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN (cont'd)<br/>And so begins her life of crime. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You're a little late. I steal all<br/>the time. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Really? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Totally. I haven't paid for a<br/>lipstick since forever. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Be still my heart. Cute <u>and</u> bad? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(shivers)<br/>Bad to the bone. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>More like frozen. Here...</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He stops, takes off his leather jacket, drapes it around her shoulders. 
      She loves the feel of it -- and the fact it's his. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Thanks.</center>
<p>Justin gently moves a stray strand of hair from her face. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>My pleasure, Miss Summers.</center>
<p>It's a perfect moment -- broken by Janice popping up sipping a Slurpy. 
      <p>
<center>JANICE<br/>Hey. Where's Zack? 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>He went to get the car. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(surprised)<br/>You guys got a car?</p></p></center>
<p>EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>A WOMAN is shoved out of her car. She lands hard, unconscious, her neck 
      bleeding. The driver's side door slams shut and the car peels out. Yep. 
      Zack's got a car. 
      <p>EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy watches the Trick or Treaters and costumed partiers as she drifts 
      down the street. So much laughter, so many happy faces. She spots a COUPLE 
      sharing a kiss. Time slows and the sound of the crowd fades as she eyes 
      them with longing. 
      <p>She absently steps out into the street and WHAM! A speeding ambulance 
      almost clips her, siren blaring. Buf fy watches it go, her eyes narrowing. 

      <p>EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy comes up on a small crowd. Paramedics are loading the woman Zack 
      bit onto a gurney. 
      <p>
<center>PARAMEDIC #1<br/>I'm losing her pulse! 
      <p>PARAMEDIC #2<br/>Get her in! Go!</p></center>
<p>Buffy spots the puncture wounds on her neck as they lift the gurney 
      into the ambulance. Her face darkens. Vamps! 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
      <p>The phone in the kitchen is ringing. Music blares in the background. 
      Giles picks up the phone, all celebratory smiles. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Summers' residence. Oh, yes, Mrs.<br/>Penshaw, how 
      --<br/>(tensing)<br/>No, Dawn told us she was spending the<br/>night at your 
      house. Yes. Yes, I<br/>realize that now, but I don't believe<br/>you called 
      to check either. All<br/>right -- yes, let's just -- If I hear<br/>anything, 
      I'll let you know.</center>
<p>He hangs up, fuming. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander, Anya and Willow are doing the bump and grind. Tara watches from 
      the couch, still feeling the sting of her earlier disagreement with 
      Willow. Giles enters, turns off the music. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Hey, we were just gettin' our funk on. 
      <p>GILES<br/>That was Janice's mother. Apparently<br/>Janice told her 
      <u>she</u> was spending the<br/>night <u>here</u>. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Dipping into the classics. Gotta<br/>respect that. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Is Buffy still outside? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>No, she was feeling antsy, went to<br/>grab Spike for a 
      patrol. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(sourly)<br/>Always nice to be in the loop.<br/>Xander, Anya -- 
      stay here in case<br/>Mrs. Penshaw calls. Willow, Tara,<br/>check downtown. 
      I'll swing by<br/>Spike's and see if I can catch Buffy.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles exits. Tara and Willow grab their coats. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>(worried)<br/>Deja Dawn. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Just typical teen stuff. I'm sure<br/>she's fine. Not like 
      there's a<br/>Hellgod out there trying to drain her<br/>blood this time, 
      right?</p></center>
<p>EXT. ZACK'S CAR - NIGHT 
      <p>The car Zack boosted is parked in a clearing near the woods over 
      looking the cemetery. The back door pops open and Zack and Janice tumble 
      out, kissing and laughing. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>(calling inside)<br/>Don't do nothin' I would, 
      dude.</center>
<p>Janice kisses him hard. 
      <p>
<center>JANICE<br/>You're it.</center>
<p>Janice giggles, dashes off. Zack watches her go, his eyes twinkling. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>Love it when they run.</center>
<p>Zack grins, morphing into VAMP FACE. 
      <p>INT. ZACK'S CAR - NIGHT 
      <p>The back door slams shut. Dawn, none the wiser, is in the front seat 
      with Justin, wearing his leather jacket. An awkward beat. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>So. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Yeah.</p></center>
<p>Justin smiles warmly. Dawn blushes, blows in her hands to warm them. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>It's cold. You okay?<br/>(re: jacket)<br/>You want this 
      back. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Nah. Cold doesn't really bother me. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What are you, Superman? 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>(laughs)<br/>No. But I do have a few 
      special<br/>powers...</p></p></p></center>
<p>He leans in for a kiss. Dawn chickens out at the last second. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Hey, does this work?</center>
<p>She turns on the radio. Nothing. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>You gotta turn the ignition.</center>
<p>He turns the key in the ignition, activating the electrical system. The 
      radio flares to life. Something achingly romantic plays, like Johnny and 
      Santo's "Sleep Walk". 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>I love this one. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Another thing we have in common.</p></center>
<p>Justin gently strokes her hair, traces his fingers down her neck. Dawn 
      shivers at his touch. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN (cont'd)<br/>You're shaking. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's... cold. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>(moving closer)<br/>Do you want to go? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>No, I just... you know, what do you<br/>expect -- 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Shhh.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He puts a finger to her lips, gently traces them. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN (cont'd) <br/>I just... want to taste you...</center>
<p>He leans in and kisses her softly. It's an electric moment. Dawn sighs, 
      melting into him as the tender kiss goes on and on... 
      <p>

      <p>Dawn draws back from the tender kiss, breathless. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(dazed)<br/>Shiver me timbers. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>What? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Uh, nothing, just... wow. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>(surprised)<br/>Oh my God. That was your first. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Wha --no! 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>It was! That was your first kiss. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I've been kissed before. I kiss all<br/>the time. Not that I'm a 
      kiss slut,<br/>but, you know, I'm just saying with<br/>the lips and the 
      pressing together<br/>and stuff -- hey, expert here.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Justin stares at her with a wry grin. Dawn cracks. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Okay, it was my first kiss, all<br/>right! I know, 
      I suck! My lips are<br/>dry and my tongue's all horrible and<br/>sticky and 
      I'm pretty sure I drooled<br/>so just tell me how awful it was and 
      -</center>
<p>Justin kisses her softly, cutting her off . 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>It was perfect.</center>
<p>Dawn melts under his lips. Kissage, round two. 
      <p>INT. BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>The Bronze is decked out for Halloween and filled with costumed 
      partiers. A ROCK BAND wails. Willow and Tara wade through the crowd, 
      practically having to yell to be heard. Luke Skywalker and Princess Lea 
      bump and grind nearby. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Do they know they're brother and<br/>sister? 
      <p>TARA<br/>(glancing about)<br/>You think she's here? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What? 
      <p>TARA<br/>(louder)<br/>Do you think Dawn might have come<br/>here?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow takes in the crowd, grins. It's a wild scene. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>It's where I'd be if I were sixteen<br/>and on the lam. 
      <p>TARA<br/>Really?</p></center>
<p>Tara frowns at all the loud commotion. Totally not her scene. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Well, not me at sixteen, 'cause, <br/>hello -- spaz. 
      <p>TARA<br/>(mock shock)<br/>You? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Hard to believe such a hot mama yama <br/>came from such 
      humble, bad hat-<br/>wearing, geek-infested roots. 
      <p>TARA<br/>(grimaces)<br/>Infested roots. Trying to turn me on? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I have to try?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow gives her a kiss. Tara's thrilled the tension from their earlier 
      argument has subsided. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Come on. Let's try up here.</center>
<p>Willow takes Tara's hand and leads her up the stairs to the upper 
      level. They push their way through the crowd, end up on the catwalk 
      overlooking the dance floor. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>Do you see her? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No, there's too many people. 
      <p>TARA<br/>Maybe we could ask security to -- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It'll take too long.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow starts to chant, her eyes going black. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>One among many, many fade to one. . . 
      <p>TARA<br/>What are you doing? Will -</p></center>
<p>Tara grabs Willow's arm, breaking her concentration. Her eyes return to 
      normal. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I'm just going to clear the crowd. 
      <p>TARA<br/>How? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'll shift everyone that's not a<br/>sixteen-year-old girl 
      into an<br/>alternate dimension. 
      <p>TARA<br/>What?! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It'll just be for a fraction of a<br/>second. They won't even 
      notice.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow turns back to her spell. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>Will, no! You can't! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Why? 
      <p>TARA<br/>What if something goes wrong? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It won't. 
      <p>TARA<br/>But w-what would Giles say?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow's face turns dark. Tara has just pushed a big red button. Willow 
      barks at her noisy surroundings.

<p>The music and noise suddenly fade around them so they can hear each 
      other. The rest of the crowd continues laughing and dancing, oblivious. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>So you're taking his side now? 
      <p>TARA<br/>This isn't about sides. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Have you two been talking about me<br/>behind my back? 
      <p>TARA<br/>No, God -- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You know how that makes me feel? 
      <p>TARA<br/>Willow, you're using too much magic.<br/>What do you want me to 
      do? Just sit<br/>back and keep my mouth shut? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That'd be a good start.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>That hits Tara like a kick in the stomach. Willow instantly regrets it, 
      but it's too late to take it back. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>If I didn't love you so damn much, I<br/>would.</center>
<p>Tara turns and heads back down. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Tara --</center>
<p>Willow sags, kicking herself. She stands there alone on the catwalk as 
      the sound fades back up, engulfing her. 
      <p>INT. ZACK'S CAR - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn and Justin are really making out heavy now. All teenage tongues 
      and teeth. The genie has definitely left the bottle. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>Mmm... you taste so good. . . </center>
<p>He nibbles her lip a bit too hard. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Ow. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Sorry. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's okay. Long as it's not bleeding.</p></p></center>
<p>Things quickly heat up again. Justin's hands begin to migrate toward 
      second base. Dawn catches his hand, eases it back down. More kissing, more 
      hand creepage. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Justin, can we just. . . 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Sorry. It's just. . . God, you are so<br/>beautiful . . 
      .</p></center>
<p>Dawn is stunned -- and totally swept away. She kisses him softly, but 
      quickly gives in to teen desire. Justin's breath comes in ragged gasps as 
      the kissing and touching heats to volcanic levels. His face VAMPS. 
      <p>Dawn, her eyes closed as they continue kissing, doesn't notice. But as 
      the make out session continues, her hand roams up to his face -- and 
      freeze as it encounters that unmistakable bulge. Her eyes crash open in 
      terror. 
      <p>INT. SPIKE'S CRYPT - NIGHT 
      <p>BOOM! Spike's door crashes open. Buffy strides in. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Get your gear together, we need to --</center>
<p>She stops, glances around. An old black and white horror movie is on 
      the TV. There's a bowl of half eaten popcorn on Spike's chair, but no 
      Spike. The television casts eerie, dancing shadows across the dim crypt. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Spike?</center>
<p>Spike appears next to her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Ahhh! 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(startled)<br/>Ahhh!</p></center>
<p>Spike frowns, ambles out. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>You know in civilized cultures that's<br/>called 
      trespassing. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Good thing you're uncivilized. We've<br/>got trouble. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Giles found you? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Giles? No, is he looking for me? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Yeah. It's Dawn -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(freaking)<br/>What happened? Is she all right? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>No, it's okay. Giles came by earlier<br/>looking for you. Dawn 
      and her little<br/>friend pulled a Houdini. Up to a bit<br/>of candy corn 
      mischief, I suspect. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Wait, Dawn's running around out there<br/>somewhere? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Kid's these days, eh? I just did a<br/>sweep of the tunnels. 
      Giles is<br/>poking about the cemetery -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We have to find her.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy strides over to Spike's weapons chest, kicks it open. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Don't think she's in there. </center>
<p>Buffy roughly tosses him a pistol crossbow. 
      <p>EXT. EDGE OF CEMETERY - NIGHT 
      <p>Giles works a flashlight, poking about in the mist-shrouded, schmuck 
      baity cemetery. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Mist. Cemetery. Halloween. This<br/>should end 
      well.</center>
<p>Giles disappears out of frame. He's stumbled over something. He dusts 
      himself off. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>Bloody brilliant.</center>
<p>A MUFFLED SCREAM splits the air. Giles freezes. Another SCREAM, weaker 
      this time, coming from the woods at the edge of the cemetery. 
      <p>EXT. WOODS NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT 
      <p>Giles races through the woods. He reaches the edge of a clearing, 
      freezes. A teen VAMP is kneeling on the ground, his teeth planted in the 
      neck of a girl with long brown hair obscuring her face. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Dawn!</center>
<p>The teen vamp snaps his head up and WHAM! Giles smashes his flashlight 
      into his temple. The teen vamp howls. 
      <p>Giles kicks him, sending the vamp tumbling down a small embankment. 
      Giles rushes to Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd) <br/>Dawn! Are you all right --</center>
<p>She looks up at him, dazed. It's not Dawn -- it's Janice. 
      <p>
<center>JANICE<br/>He bit me! That jerk bit me! 
      <p>ZACK (O.S.)<br/>Like you weren't asking for it.</p></center>
<p>Zack appears at the top of the embankment. His head's bleeding from 
      getting cracked with the flashlight. Not a happy vamp. Giles stands, ready 
      to bring on the hurt. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I'm fairly certain she wasn't. 
      <p>ZACK<br/>(advancing)<br/>What do you know about it, grandpa?</p></center>
<p>WHAM! Zack attacks. Janice is knocked to the ground. This kid could 
      definitely kill Giles if he's not careful. Giles takes a couple of strong 
      hits -- then blocks a punch in mid air. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Quite a bit, actually.</center>
<p>He unleashes a flurry of blows, surprising Zack Giles spins, kicks Zack 
      in the chest. Zack flies back and slams into a sheared off tree branch. He 
      stares at the end poking out of his chest. 
      <p>
<center>ZACK<br/>Dude, that sucks.</center>
<p>He explodes into dust. Giles helps Janice up. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>(winded)<br/>Dawn. . . where's Dawn. . .</center>
<p>EXT. WOODS - CLEARING NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT 
      <p>The passenger door to Zack's car bursts open. Dawn struggles out, 
      kicking at Justin as she tumbles to the ground. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Get off of me!</center>
<p>She scampers to her feet, but Justin is right there next to her. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>Dawn, wait! Wait!</center>
<p>Justin grabs her. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN (cont'd)<br/>I thought we could, you know, hang<br/>out or 
      something. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Hang out? 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Yeah, I mean, you're not like the<br/>other girls. They're 
      boring and <br/>stupid and you're. . . you're <br/>different. There's 
      something special<br/>about you. I knew it the first time <br/>I saw you.

<p>Dawn can't help but melt a little. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN (cont'd)<br/>I just want to be close to you,<br/>that's all. 
      </center>
<p>He brushes a strand of hair from her face. She flinches. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN (cont'd)<br/>Shh ... It's okay.</center>
<p>He nuzzles in close, inhaling her scent. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN (cont'd)<br/>It'll only hurt for a second. . . </center>
<p>He bares his teeth for the bite. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.S.)<br/>Bet you say that to all the girls.</center>
<p>Justin whips his head around. Giles is coming out of the woods, his 
      eyes flashing angrily. Dawn snaps out of it. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Giles --</center>
<p>Justin growls, clamps his hand around her throat. Giles continues 
      advancing, ready to introduce some serious pain. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I'll give you a choice, son. We can<br/>do this the easy 
      way, or we can do it<br/>the - -</center>
<p>Headlights click on. Giles freezes, blinded. Another set flare to life, 
      quickly followed by half a dozen more. Eight other cars are parked further 
      back in the clearing. 
      <p>Doors pop open. Half a dozen ADULT VAMPS get out, along with Christy, 
      Marla, and Glenn, also vamped. Fresh blood drips from their mouths. It's 
      Make Out Lane, vamp style. Giles is surrounded. Justin grins. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>What were my choices again?</center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CLEARING NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT 
      <p>The vamps start to move in. Giles tenses, trying to keep an eye on all 
      of them at the same time. WHAM! A hand clamps down on his shoulder. 
      Fortunately, it's connected to Spike. The vamps freeze. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>This a private game, or can anyone<br/>have a go?</center>
<p>Buffy comes around Giles' other side. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Dawn! Are you --</center>
<p>She freezes, eyeing the jacket she's wearing, the boy she's with, and 
      the car she's standing next to. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Were you parking? With a vamp?! </center>
<p>Dawn shakes the confused Justin off. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>I didn't know he was dead! 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>Living dead. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Shut up. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>How could you not know? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I just met him. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So you were parked in the woods with<br/>a boy you just met? 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>We've seen each other at parties-- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Shut up.<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>I can't believe you. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Oh like you've never fallen for a<br/>vampire. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That was different. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It always is when it's you.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>CARL, the older vamp leader, meekly interjects. 
      <p>
<center>CARL<br/>Uh ... can we fight now? </center>
<p>Buffy takes in the bloody vamps with disgust. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Didn't any of you come here just to<br/>make out?</center>
<p>A YOUNG MAN standing with his GIRL raises a shaky hand. They're both 
      human, and scared out of their wits. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Aw, now that's sweet. You, run.</center>
<p>The couple takes off. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>(to Adult Vamp #1)<br/>You, scream.</center>
<p>Buffy explodes into action, connecting a vicious kick to Adult Vamp 
      #1's face. He screams in pain. All kinds of Halloween hell breaks loose as 
      Giles and Spike join in. 
      <p>
<center>ADULT VAMP #1<br/>Die, Slayer!</center>
<p>WHAM! Buffy stakes him. Dusty dust. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Been there, done that.</center>
<p>Justin grabs Dawn, his eyes lighting up. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>Your sister's the Slayer? I totally<br/>get that. I knew 
      there was something<br/>special about you.</center>
<p>BAM! She knees him in the crotch, takes off. 
      <p>ON GILES 
      <p>getting tag teamed by Christy and Marla. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Giles!</center>
<p>Buffy tosses him a stake. WHAM WHAM! He dusts the two girls, then gets 
      tackled by Glenn. They fly over a car hood and tumble out of view. 
      <p>ON BUFFY 
      <p>as she chases ADULT VAMP #2. They end up around a bend, separated from 
      the rest of the fight. 
      <p>The vamp reaches his car, but Buffy catches up to him before he can 
      leap in. They trade blows. He blocks a punch, scoops her up and body slams 
      her on the hood of the car. He rears back and fires a fist at her head. 
      She rolls out of the way at the last second. BAM! His fist punches a hole 
      through the hood. 
      <p>Buffy rips his car antennae off, whips him into a bloody mess. He 
      knocks the antennae away, sending Buffy slamming into the side of the car. 
      He swings his fist, but Buffy throws open the car door, using it as a 
      shield. His fist crashes through the window. He howls in pain. 
      <p>Buffy and the vamp trade blows around the car door. Much Jackie 
      Chan-age. Buffy fires a vicious kick through the busted window. CRACK! The 
      vamp goes down, his head smacking the inside of the car. Buffy whip-kicks 
      the door closed, decapitating him. Dust. 
      <p>MAIN CLEARING - ON SPIKE 
      <p>trading blows with Carl. 
      <p>
<center>CARL<br/>What's your malfunction, man! 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>It's Halloween, you nit! We take the<br/>night off. Those are 
      the rules. 
      <p>CARL<br/>Me and mine don't follow no stinking<br/>rules. We're rebels! 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>No, I'm a rebel. You're an idiot.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike kicks him hard. Carl slams back into a car. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Make that a dusty idiot.</center>
<p>Spike whips out a crossbow pistol from under his coat, fires. THUNK! 
      Carl explodes into dust. Spike loads another bolt. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Give the lot of us a bad name.</center>
<p>WHAM! A vamp tackles him. The crossbow flies out of Spike's hand. 
      <p>ON DAWN 
      <p>at the far edge of the clearing, backing away into the woods as the 
      rest of the vamps get polished off. Justin pops up behind her. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN<br/>Trick or treat!</center>
<p>Dawn screams, starts to run. He tackles her to the ground at the edge 
      of the fighting. Spike's fallen crossbow lies nearby, barely visible. 
      Justin straddles Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>JUSTIN (cont'd)<br/>Give me something good to eat. </center>
<p>She looks up at him, more hurt than scared. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>I thought you really liked me. 
      <p>JUSTIN<br/>(sincerely)<br/>I do. And you like me, too. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(a beat - sincerely)<br/>I do.</p></p></center>
<p>Justin smiles -- then suddenly stiffens and explodes into dust. Dawn is 
      holding the bolt from Spike's fallen crossbow. She just dusted her first 
      kiss. She lays there, frozen, tears welling up in her eyes. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Everyone's returned to Buffy Central, including Willow and Tara. Xander 
      and Anya are on their way out. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Sorry about the party. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Don't worry about it. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>It gave me time to plan the bridal<br/>shower. Where do we order 
      obscenely<br/>muscular male strippers? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Ahn. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Kidding. Jeez.<br/>(mouthed to Buffy) <br/>We'll talk.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They exit. Spike is close behind. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Guess I should bugger off. Something<br/>about Big Bad's 
      not venturing far<br/>from their crypts on Halloween? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Good fight.</p></center>
<p>They bump their fists together as Spike exits. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>So, big monster mashing. Sorry we<br/>missed it. 
      <p>TARA<br/>(curtly)<br/>As long as Dawn's all right. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah, I mean that's -- 
      <p>TARA<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>I think I'm gonna turn in. 
Good<br/>night.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Tara heads up the stairs, her fight with Willow obviously unresolved. 
      Willow smiles weakly at Buffy, follows Tara up the stairs. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Tara . . .</center>
<p>Buffy turns her attention to Giles. He's got an ice pack pressed to his 
      bruised check. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>How's the face? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Still ruggedly handsome. <br/>(frowns)<br/>Grandpa, 
      indeed.</p></center>
<p>Buffy glances over into the dining room. Dawn is sitting in a chair, 
      staring out the window. Justin's jacket is on her lap, her fingers 
      absently feeling the leather. She really had fallen for the guy. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>She's taking it pretty hard. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Not surprising. Still, we can't<br/>ignore this kind of 
      behavior. <br/>Something has to be done before it<br/>spins out of control. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're right.<br/>(a beat)<br/>I'm glad you're here to sort it 
      out.<br/>Don't be too hard on her, okay?</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy turns and heads up the stairs, leaving Giles holding the bag. He 
      watches her go, not happy with the big avoiding of responsibility. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Giles enter. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>We need to have a conversation. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>This the part where you tell me<br/>you're not angry, just 
      disappointed? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Pretty much. Except for the bit<br/>about not being 
      angry.</p></p></center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - WILLOW AND TARA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow and Tara are getting ready for bed. Things are tense, the 
      silence heavy. Willow is obviously hurting. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I'm sorry. Okay? 
      <p>TARA<br/>It's not that easy. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What do you want me to do? Reverse<br/>time and take it 
      back?<br/>(laughs)<br/>'Cause I might be able to if I --</p></p></center>
<p>Tara turns away. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Joke. Don't think I could really -- 
      <p>TARA<br/>Can we not do this now? I'm tired. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Okay.</p></p></center>
<p>Tara slides into bed. Willow turns away, wounded. She picks out a small 
      weed-like flower from an array of spell ingredient jars on the dresser. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Let's just forget about it.</center>
<p>
<center>
<table width="60%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><font face="Verdana" size="-1">
<center>WILLOW<br/>(softly, in 
          Latin)<br/>Obliviscere.</center></font></td>
<td><font face="Verdana" size="-1">
<center>WILLOW<br/>(English 
        translation)<br/>Forget.</center></font></td></tr></tbody></table></center>
<p>The flower glows slightly for a moment. Willow closes it in her hand 
      and gets into bed. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>Ouhh, you're feet are cold. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Better warm me up.</p></center>
<p>She kisses Tara, tender and loving. Tara responds in kind. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>Mmm. Now that's the way a day should<br/>always end. And 
      start. And all the<br/>stuff in the middle. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>So. . . you're not mad? 
      <p>TARA<br/>About what?</p></p></center>
<p>Tara cuddles in close, all sighs and smiles. Willow's spell has made 
      her forget about their fight. Willow smiles. All's right with her world 
      again.
