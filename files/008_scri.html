      <p>We see a YOUNG MAN approaching. Three others stand behind him, 
      reverently quiet. He stops, and smiling, kneels before us. We HEAR a 
      voice: 
      <p>
<center>MOLOCH (O.S.) <br/>Carlo, my dear one...</center>
<p>A horrible CLAWED HAND emerges and rests on the Man's head as if 
      bestowing a blessing. The Man smiles rapturously... 
      <p>CLOSE ON: MOLOCH 
      <p>He is the corruptor, a horned demon. He looks upon the man and speaks. 
      Subtitles translate his strangely gentle Italian... 
      <p>
<center>MOLOCH<br/>Do you love me? I will give you <br/>everything. All I 
      want is your <br/>love.</center>
<p>The enormous hand TWISTS, SNAPPING the smiling Man's neck... 
      <p>

<p>INT. MONASTERY - MINUTES LATER 
      <p>A group of monks has assembled. The eldest of them, brother THELONIUS, 
      holds an ornate book. 
      <p>
<center>THELONIUS<br/>It is Moloch. The corrupter. He <br/>walks again. More 
      and more of our <br/>people have fallen under his <br/>mesmerizing 
      power.</center>
<p>The men look at him in fear as he moves to the center of the room. 
      <p>
<center>THELONIOUS<br/>We must form the circle. Now! <br/>There is still 
      time to bind him.</center>
<p>The monks form a circle around Thelonius. They begin to CHANT in Latin. 
      Thelonius, at the center of the Circle, opens the book. The pages are all 
      blank. 
      <p>INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Moloch lets the man's body drop with a sigh of contentment. The 
      CHANTING becomes audible in here. Moloch whips his head around, concern on 
      his face. 
      <p>
<center>MOLOCH<br/>No...</center>
<p>INT. MONASTERY - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>The CHANTING continues. 
      <p>
<center>THELONIUS<br/>(By the power of the Circle of <br/>Kayless, I command 
      you, demon... <br/>come!)</center>
<p>A wind picks up in the room. Thelonius stops, looks around. It's 
      working. 
      <p>
<center>THELONIUS<br/>I command you!</center>
<p>INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Moloch SCREAMS and as he does, we see his face dissolving, the 
      particles sucked out of frame -- 
      <p>ANGLE: THE BOOK 
      <p>Suddenly STRANGE CHARACTERS SPLASH onto the blank pages as the demon's 
      spirit is sucked into the book. 
      <p>The CHANTING stops. Thelonius looks down at the book. 
      <p>ANGLE: LATER 
      <p>Thelonius places the evil book inside a wooden crate. 
      <p>ANGLE: LOOKING OUT FROM INSIDE THE CRATE 
      <p>Thelonius' face, now weary, appears as he intones -- 
      <p>
<center>THELONIUS<br/>(Pray this accursed book shall <br/>never again be 
      read, lest the demon <br/>Moloch be loosed upon the world...)</center>
<p>He shoves the heavy lid over, and all is BLACKNESS... 
      <p>INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY (PRESENT DAY) 
      <p>And the lid is PRIED OPEN! It's BUFFY, disappointed. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh, great. A book.</center>
<p>Buffy pulls out the now-dusty book, idly tracing the RUNE as GILES 
      comes over. 
      <p>In the library we see a few COMPUTERS with scanners, a jarring sight in 
      the old-world library. WILLOW, XANDER and two boys scan in books at the 
      other terminals. They are DAVE, a shy, bookish kid, and FRITZ, a big, 
      slovenly bruiser. Computer geniuses both. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I haven't gone through the new <br/>arrivals. Put it in 
      that pile --<br/>(points near Willow)</center>
<p>Dave comes up to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>DAVE<br/>Here, I got it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Thanks, Dave. The Willow pile. 
      <p>GILES<br/>After I've examined it, you can, <br/>uh... skim it in. 
      <p>WOMEN (O.S.)<br/>Scan it, Rupert. Scan it.</p></p></p></center>
<p>ANGLE: TO REVEAL 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR, computer teacher, and Giles' polar opposite. She's maybe 
      30, pretty, hip, and irreverent. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>(dripping polite venom) <br/>Of course...</center>
<p>Ms. Calendar regards the flustered Giles with amusement. 
      <p>
<center>MS. CALENDAR<br/>I know our ways are strange to you, <br/>but soon 
      you will join us in the <br/>20th century... with three whole <br/>years to 
      spare! 
      <p>GILES<br/>Ms. Calendar, I happen to believe <br/>that one can function in 
      modern <br/>society without being a slave to <br/>the idiot box. 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR <br/>That's TV. The idiot box is the <br/>TV. This is a good 
      box. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, I still prefer a good book. 
      <p>FRITZ<br/>The printed page is obsolete. <br/>Information isn't bound up 
      anymore, <br/>it's an entity. The only reality <br/>is virtual. If you're 
      not jacked <br/>in, you're not alive.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>As he walks off: 
      <p>
<center>MS. CALENDAR<br/>Thank you, Fritz... for making us <br/>all sound 
      like crazy people.<br/>(to Giles)<br/>Fritz comes on a little strong, but 
      <br/>he has a point. You know for the <br/>last two years there was more 
      <br/>E-mail sent than regular mail? <br/>More digitalized information went 
      <br/>over phone lines than <br/>conversations. 
      <p>GILES<br/>That is a fact that I regard <br/>with genuine horror. 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR <br/>I'll bet it is.<br/>(to the kids)<br/>All right, guys, 
      let's wrap it up <br/>for the day.</p></p></center>
<p>People start moving out. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I've just got a few more to do. <br/>I'll hang for a bit. 

      <p>MS. CALENDAR <br/>Cool, thanks. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(to Xander)<br/>Xander, you want to stay and help <br/>me? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Are you kidding? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yes, it was a joke I made up. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Willow, I love you, but bye.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He heads out. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>(calls out)<br/>I'll see you tomorrow... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Buffy, wait up!</p></center>
<p>Willow watches Xander's retreating figure a bit piningly, then goes 
      back to work. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I have to stay and clean up. I'll <br/>be back in the 
      Middle Ages. 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>Did you ever leave?</p></center>
<p>Off Giles's look, 
      <p>
<div align="right">DISSOLVE TO:</div>
<p>ANGLE: WILLOW - LATER (NIGHT) 
      <p>All alone now, solemnly scanning in books. She takes the ancient volume 
      and waves the glowing scanner over the first page... 
      <p>On screen, data streams into a file, BOOKl2, in a directory labeled 
      WILLOW -- strange characters like in the book... 
      <p>As Willow turns each page, we see -- but Willow does not -- the strange 
      words disappear from the paper! 
      <p>ANGLE: THE COMPUTER SCREEN 
      <p>The last characters stream into the BOOKl2 file. The screen goes BLACK.

      <p>Willow walks along, happily lost in thought. Buffy spies her, 
      approaches, calling out: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Willow! Willow! Hey, wait up!</center>
<p>Willow finally notices Buffy as she comes abreast of her. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Buffy! I didn't even see you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Or hear me. What was up last <br/>night? I tried your line like 
      a <br/>million times. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh, I was... I was talking. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Talking to...</p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow smiles. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Okay, that's it. You have a secret <br/>and that is not 
      allowed. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Why not? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(petulantly)<br/>'Cause... there's a rule. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well... I sort of met someone. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I knew it! This is so important. <br/>When did you meet? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Last week. Right after we did the <br/>scanning project in the 
      Library. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(rapid-fire)<br/>Does he go here? What's his name? <br/>Have you 
      kissed him? What's he like? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No, Malcolm, no, and very nice. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You are a thing of evil for not <br/>telling me this right 
      away. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well, I wasn't sure there was <br/>anything to tell. But last 
      <br/>night -- oh, we talked all night. <br/>It was amazing. He's so smart, 
      <br/>Buffy, and he's romantic and we <br/>agree about everything. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What's he look like? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(cheerfully)<br/>I don't know.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy tries to work that one out as they exit the hall. 
      <p>INT. COMPUTER LAB - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>It is silent in here. There are a dozen high-end computer consoles 
      (complete with camera and voice box). The only people in here are Fritz 
      and Dave, both staring at their computer screens intensely. After a 
      moment, Dave speaks quietly:

<center>DAVE<br/>Yes... I will. I promise. </center>
<p>Buffy and Willow enter, Buffy still puzzling.

<center>BUFFY<br/>You've been seeing a guy and you <br/>don't know what he 
      looks like. <br/>Okay, it's a puzzle. No wait, I'm <br/>good at these. Does 
      it involve a <br/>midget and a block of ice? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I met him on line. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>On line for what?</p></p></center>
<p>Willow indicates a computer (the one she usually works on).

      somewhere?

      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>Cool. But this is lab time so <br/>let's make it a nice 
      short visit, <br/>okay? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh sure.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow has sat at the computer and logged on. Buffy sits next to her.

      know <br/>what I mean? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(hasn't heard a word) <br/>"I'm thinking of you too!" No, 
      <br/>that's incredibly stupid. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Will. Down girl. Let's focus. <br/>What do you really know 
      about <br/>this guy? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>See, I knew you'd react like this.

      <p>BUFFY<br/>Short, tall, skinny, fat... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Why does everything have to be <br/>about looks? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Not everything. But some stuff<br/>is. I mean, what if you guys 
      get <br/>really intense and then you find <br/>out he... has a hairy back? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(almost wavers)<br/>Well... no. He doesn't talk like<br/>the 
      kind of person who has a hairy<br/>back. And anyway that stuff<br/>doesn't 
      matter if you really care<br/>about each other.<br/>(a little 
      vulnerable)<br/>Maybe I'm not his ideal of<br/>babelitude either. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(softening the moment) <br/>Hey. I just want to make sure he's 
      <br/>good enough for you, that's all. I <br/>think it's great that you're --

      model of a <br/>well-ordered society"? I didn't <br/>write that! Who's been

<center>XANDER<br/>Guess who. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Xander. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Well, yeah, but keep guessing <br/>anyway.

      No,<br/>you probably have to slay vampires<br/>or some lame endeavor like

      <p>XANDER<br/>That's meaningless drivel. I'm not <br/>interested in Willow 
      like that. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, but you got used to being the <br/>belle of the ball.

      school <br/>student. I could say I was a <br/>high school student. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You are. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Okay, but I could also say I was an <br/>elderly Dutch woman, 
      get me? Who's<br/>to say I'm not? If I'm in the <br/>elderly Dutch chat room 
      -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I get your point. <br/>(it sinks in)<br/>I get your point. This 
      guy could <br/>be anything. Old, weird, crazy... <br/>he could be a circus 
      freak! 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You know, you read about these <br/>things all the time. Two

      <p>WILLOW<br/>Not like me to have a boyfriend? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He's... boyfriendly? 
      <p>WILLOW <br/>I don't understand why you don't<br/>want me to have this. 
      Boys don't<br/>chase me around all the time-I <br/>thought you'd be happy 
      for me. 
      <p>BUFFY <br/>I just want you to be sure. To <br/>meet him face to face-in a 
      <br/>crowded place - in daylight - with<br/>some friends. You know, before

      <p>
<center>DAVE<br/>Oh. What do you want? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I wanted to ask you something. If <br/>you had a minute... 
      <p>DAVE<br/>(scattered)<br/>A minute. Okay. Yeah, a minute... <br/>What is 
      it? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, you're a computer geek <br/>(covering)<br/>--nius... I 
      have a technical <br/>problem. If I wanted to find out <br/>something about 
      someone, if someone <br/>E-mailed me, could I trace the <br/>letter? 
      <p>DAVE<br/>Well, you can pull up someone's <br/>profile based on their user 
      name. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But they write the profile <br/>themselves, right? So they 
      could <br/>say anything they want. 
      <p>DAVE<br/>True. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Wow, I had knowledge.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Dave smiles -- she's bringing him out a bit. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Well, is there a way to find out <br/>exactly where a 
      letter -- an<br/>E-letter -- came from? I mean the<br/>actual location of 
      the computer? 
      <p>DAVE<br/>(intrigued)<br/>It's a challenge...

      <p>XANDER<br/>Calax Research and Development. <br/>Computer research lab. 
      Third <br/>biggest employer in Sunnydale, till <br/>it closed last

      <p>GILES<br/>It's just somewhat unprecedented.

<center>COMPUTER<br/>I'm a coward and I can't go on <br/>living like this. 
      Forgive me, Mom <br/>and Dad.</center>

      writing.

      <p>Buffy is sitting, Giles looking at her with concern. Xander paces, 
      upset. Buffy is taking it slow, a little frazzled. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>I'm gonna kill Dave. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He tried to warn me. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Warn you that he set you up! <br/>(to Giles)<br/>Is she gonna 
      be okay? 
      <p>GILES<br/>She was only grounded for a moment. <br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Still, 
      if you'd been anyone but <br/>the Slayer... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(with quiet concern) <br/>Tell me the truth. How's my hair? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>It's great. It's your best hair <br/>ever. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Oh yes. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I just don't understand what would <br/>make Dave do a thing 
      like that. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I think perhaps I do. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Care to share? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Does this look familiar to either <br/>of you?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He shows them the Moloch volume. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, sure. It looks like a book. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I knew that one. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, this particular book was sent <br/>to me by an 
      archeologist friend who <br/>found it in an old monastery. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Wow, that's really boring. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(glares at him)<br/>There are certain books that are <br/>not 
      meant to be read. Ever. They <br/>have things trapped within them. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Things. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Demons. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Here we go... 
      <p>GILES<br/>In the Dark Ages Demons' souls were<br/>sometimes trapped in 
      certain <br/>volumes. The demon would remain in <br/>the book, harmless, 
      unless the book <br/>was read aloud. <br/>(points to the picture) <br/>If I'm 
      not mistaken, this is <br/>Moloch, the corruptor. A very <br/>deadly and 
      seductive demon. He<br/>draws people to him with promises<br/>of love, 
      power, knowledge. Preys<br/>on impressionable minds. 
      <p>XANDER <br/>Like Dave's. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Dave, and who knows how many<br/>others. 
      <p>BUFFY <br/>And Moloch is in that book? 
      <p>GILES<br/>(shows the blank pages) <br/>Not anymore. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You released Moloch!? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh, way to go. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I didn't read it! That awful <br/>Calendar woman found it and 
      it was <br/>already blank. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So a powerful demon with horns is <br/>walking around 
      Sunnydale? And <br/>nobody's noticing? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>If he's so big and strong, why <br/>bother with Dave? Why 
      didn't he<br/>just attack Buffy himself? 
      <p>GILES<br/>I don't know. And I don't know who <br/>could have read the 
      book. It <br/>wasn't even in English. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Where was it? 
      <p>GILES<br/>In a pile, with the other books <br/>that were... 
      scanned...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Everybody gets real quiet. As one, they turn to the computer sitting on 
      the desk. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Willow scanned all the new books. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>And that released the demon. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No... he's not out here. He's in <br/>there.</p></p></center>
<p>She points to the computer. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>(working it out)<br/>The scanner read the book. Brought 
      <br/>Moloch out -- as information to be <br/>absorbed. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He's gone binary on us. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Okay, for those of us in our studio <br/>audience who are me, 
      you guys are <br/>saying that Moloch is in this <br/>computer. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And in every computer connected to<br/>it by a modem. 
      <p>GILES<br/>He's everywhere. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So what do we do? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Put him back in the book? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Willow scanned him into her file. <br/>This may be a futile 
      gesture, but I <br/>suggest we delete it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Solid.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She sits, turns on the computer. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Don't get too close. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So, which file is it? Willow. <br/>That'd probably be the one. 
      I'll <br/>just delete the whole thing.</p></center>
<p>ANGLE: THE SCREEN 
      <p>The Willow file icon is highlighted, dragged to the trash. Suddenly a 
      digitalized image of Moloch's horrible face fills the screen, turning and 
      looking right at us. We hear that voice: 
      <p>
<center>COMPUTER<br/>Stay away from Willow. It's none <br/>of your 
      business.</center>
<p>And the computer turns itself off. All three stare at it in shock. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>"Stay away." That's just what <br/>Dave said when I asked 
      about Willow <br/>and... Malcolm... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>What are you thinking? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(quietly)<br/>I'm wishing Willow's new boyfriend <br/>was just 
      an axe-murdering circus <br/>freak.</p></p></center>

      <p>BUFFY<br/>The first thing we do is find <br/>Willow. She's probably

      <p>All the consoles turn on at once, Buffy takes a step back, creeped out.

      <p>The door from the hall opens and Buffy marches in, Xander behind her. 
      The guard at the security station comes up to her -- blocking her path and 
      reaching for his weapon. Buffy doesn't even break stride as her fist slams 
      his face, sending him groundward. 
      <p>She heads for the door opposite, but Xander stops at the security 
      station, looks at the video monitors.

      <p>Buffy and Xander enter at a good clip. They see the door marked

<p>The lights go out, emergency lights casting a dim, eerie glow. We hear

      came in through -- it's locked.

      extinguisher, speaking through gritted teeth.

<center>WILLOW<br/>Remember me? Your girlfriend?</center>
<p>SMASH -- in the head again.

<p>She brings it down again -- only this time he grabs it. Throws it and 
      her away -- she flies back right at the returning Xander, knocking them 
      both down. 
      <p>Moloch turns back to Buffy, who has gotten shakily to her feet. She 
      punches him once in the stomach area. Bad idea. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Ahhh! 
      <p>MOLOCH<br/>This body is all I have left, but <br/>it's enough to crush

<p>He advances -- she steps back, looks around for an avenue of escape. 
      <p>ANGLE: BUFFY'S POV 
      <p>there is no escape -- she's backed into a corner. Right behind her is a 
      giant fuse box with the legend DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE on it. 
      <p>Sayyy... 
      <p>She backs up another step, faces Moloch. 
      <p>

<p>Moloch pulls back his arm -- drives his fist at her -- and Buffy does a 
      perfect split. 
      <p>Drops right out the line of fire as Moloch SLAMS his fist right into 
      the fuse box. 
      <p>He starts to shake, to smoke -- as Buffy rolls out and comes up next to 
      him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hurts, doesn't it?</center>
<p>He turns to her, smoke pouring from his eyes like fury. She takes a 
      step back as he starts to spark -- she turns and runs --

<center>BUFFY<br/>Get down!</center>
<p>-- and DIVES to the floor alongside Xander and Willow as

      than I used <br/>to be. 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>It was your book that started the <br/>trouble, not a 
      computer. Honestly,<br/>what is it about them that bothers <br/>you so much? 

      <p>GILES<br/>(a moment, then)<br/>The smell. 
      <p>MS. CALENDAR<br/>Computers don't smell, Rupert. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I know. Smell is the most powerful <br/>memory trigger there 
      is. A certain <br/>flower or a whiff of smoke can <br/>bring up experiences 
      long <br/>forgotten. Books smell -- musty <br/>and rich. Knowledge gained 
      from a <br/>computer has no texture, no <br/>context. It's there and then 
      it's <br/>gone. If it's to last, the getting <br/>of knowledge should be 
      tangible. <br/>It should be smelly.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
