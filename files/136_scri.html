      <p>&lt;already shot&gt; 
      <p>We see what happened when that BRINGER attacked GILES: 
      <p>Giles is kneeling over Robson. 
      <p>Robson sees what's coming and passes out before Giles' fancy move. 
      <p>The blade comes swinging at the back of Giles' head. Giles grabs it 
      blind and uses its own momentum to cut off the head of the Bringer who 
      swung it. 
      <p>As Giles stands over what appears to be two dead bodies -- one his 
      friend and colleague, the other a headless Bringer corpse, we pre-lap:

      new Potential CHAO-AHN, out on patrol in the cemetery. The Potential 
      Slayers all have stakes, but they're not focused on the dangerous darkness 
      around them as they walk. They're all listening, riveted, as Giles 
      continues his exciting story. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (CONT'D)<br/>... and years of training, don't<br/>forget that, 
      but I honestly feel the<br/>largest part of it was instinct.<br/>Instinct 
      and reflexes. There's a<br/>certain wary watchfulness I've honed<br/>over 
      the years. Almost like another<br/><u>sense</u>-</center>
<p>GILES is BLIND-SIDED, TACKLED TO THE GROUND AND OUT OF FRAME BY SPIKE

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - BUFFY'S ROOM - DAY 
      (DAY 2) 
      <p>Early the next morning. Buffy is in her room, deciding on a pair of 
      earrings. She's considering hoops when she looks up to see Giles standing 
      in the doorway. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>You know this is very dangerous. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You've just heard horror stories,<br/>that's all. Wear hoops 
      and they'll<br/>catch on something, rip your lobes<br/>off, lobes flying 
      everywhere... 
      <p>GILES<br/>That's not what I mean. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You mean Spike not having a chip.<br/>Free-range Spike. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy, I have to ask. Why on earth<br/>did you make that 
      decision? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I guess it was instinct, like you<br/>were talking about. 
      <p>GILES<br/>What? I made that up! I knew the<br/>Bringer was behind me 
      because his<br/>shoes squeaked! Buffy, it's crucial<br/>that we keep these 
      girls safe, and I<br/>can't even keep track of the dangers:<br/>The First, 
      the Bringers, random<br/>demons and now Spike?! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And the principal. 
      <p>GILES<br/>What? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh, nothing much, just, he was in the<br/>school basement with 
      a shovel, acting<br/>kind of evasive. And he's got a "too<br/>charming to be 
      real" thing going on.<br/>I'm gonna look into it. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, that sounds very responsible of<br/>you. Balances out the 
      vampire-on-the-<br/>loose issue. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Nothing's really changed, Giles.<br/>Spike had a chip before, 
      remember?<br/>When The First made him kill and sire<br/>those people? 
      <p>GILES<br/>We have no way of knowing if his chip<br/>was functioning then. 
      A new chip<br/>might be able to restrain him should<br/>The First attempt to 
      activate him<br/>again. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It doesn't matter. The girls aren't<br/>in danger from him. He 
      wouldn't let<br/>that happen. I trust him. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, of course you trust Spike. He<br/>has slaughtered 
      thousands, and<br/>therefore probably knows all about<br/>how not to do it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He has a soul now, Giles. That's<br/>what's going to keep him 
      from hurting<br/>anyone. I'm going to trust that<br/>before I trust some 
      chip we already<br/>know can go bad on him. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He can be a good man, Giles. I feel<br/>it. But he's never 
      going to get<br/>there if we never give him a chance.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles hesitates, not sure if he wants to get into this conversation: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I want better for you.<br/>(off her look)<br/>Your feelings 
      for him are coloring<br/>your judgment. I hear it in your<br/>voice. That 
      way lies a future with<br/>a great deal of pain. I don't want<br/>that for 
      you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Giles, if you're saying there are<br/>sparks between him and 
      me, you're<br/>wrong. Spike and I haven't-- things<br/>are different since 
      he came back.<br/>Just look in his eyes and you'll see<br/>he's changed. 
      There's... there's a<br/>person in there now. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I see what's happening. It doesn't<br/>matter anymore if 
      you're... if you're<br/>physical with each other. There's a<br/>connection 
      there. You rely on him<br/>and he relies on you. <u>That's</u> 
      what's<br/>affecting your judgement. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You think I'm losing sight of the big<br/>picture. But I'm not. 
      When Spike<br/>had that chip in him it was like,<br/>like having him in a 
      muzzle or<br/>something. It feels wrong. We can't<br/>beat evil by doing 
      evil. I know that.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy turns to head out. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>(called after)<br/>I hope you're right. You're 
      gambling<br/>with a lot of lives.</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - STAIRS/ DINING ROOM / KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
      <p>Walking fast, still amped up from her conversation with Giles, Buffy 
      walks briskly down the stairs. 
      <p>In the entryway, Kennedy has hold of WILLOW's hand and is trying to tug 
      her up the stairs. Willow resists, playfully. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>You're luring me. I know when I'm<br/>being lured. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>No, really. It's important. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You're trying to get me alone and,<br/>you know, kiss or 
      something... 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>And that's not important?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow laughs and let's herself be tugged onto the stairs. 
      <p>DAWN crosses through (dining room to living room), eating cereal from a 
      bowl. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(under breath)<br/>Sure, kiss her. What harm can 
      that<br/>do?</center>
<p>And DAWN EXITS. 
      <p>Kennedy and Willow pass Buffy, who heads into the dining room, heading 
      for the kitchen. She still has a full head of steam. 
      <p>ANDREW and ANYA are in the dining room, sitting at the table. Andrew is 
      also having cereal. Anya is just talking to him. We hear a snippet: 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>...just left, so I had to walk down<br/>the aisle, in the 
      big white dress, to<br/>tell everyone the wedding was off.<br/>And they were 
      all looking at me with,<br/>like, such pity-- 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I saw the same thing on a Lifetime<br/>Movie special event! It 
      was<br/>terrible! You were Dixie Carter.</p></center>
<p>BUFFY keeps moving, heads into the kitchen, pours coffee. (A new 
      microwave, still in its box, sits on the counter.) Then: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(convincing herself)<br/>My judgment is clear.</center>
<p>She drinks some coffee. Even more convincing: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Absolutely no sparks.</center>
<p>INT. LUMBER YARD / HARDWARE STORE - DAY 
      <p>SPARKS! We're close on something that's throwing out lots of 'em... a 
      saw cutting through a metal pipe, perhaps. 
      <p>WIDEN TO REVEAL that we're in a lumber yard, where a number of young 
      men are watching a demonstration of the sparky item in question. One of 
      them is XANDER, wearing protective eyewear and looking interested. After a 
      beat, his attention is drawn to a young woman nearby, who is looking 
      around a display of ropes, a little confused. She's holding a loop of 
      rope. 
      <p>Angle on the young woman. This is MAYA. Xander approaches, removing his 
      eyewear. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Can I help? You seem kinda confused. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>You aren't wearing a red apron. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Confused but sort of randomly<br/>observant. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>Sorry. I just mean... you don't work<br/>here, right? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Oh, right. No, just helpful. I'm<br/>Xander. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>My name's Maya. And I guess I <u>could</u><br/>use some advice. 
      I can't even figure<br/>out if I've got the right kind of<br/>rope... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>That depends what you need it for.<br/>Something, like, 
      functional around<br/>the house, or you know, recreational?<br/>(catching 
      himself)<br/>By which I mean, for example, boating<br/>or mountain climbing, 
      not tying<br/>someone up for funky sexy fun...</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Maya laughs. Xander plays off his embarrassment: 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>In conclusion, rope can be useful in<br/>various 
      ways. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>I have a kayak. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>And again with the random. I like it. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>Sorry. I need to store my kayak. So<br/>I was thinking maybe I 
      could, sort<br/>of, suspend it from the ceiling of<br/>the garage with ropes 
      and maybe a<br/>pulley or a... winch-thing? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Not a bad plan. You'll need stronger<br/>rope than that. Want 
      to go bowling<br/>with me tonight? 
      <p>MAYA<br/>What?</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>With a smile: 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Oh, you're the only one who gets to<br/>be 
      random?</center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - OFFICE AREA - DAY 
      <p>Buffy moves stealthily from her cubicle into Principal Wood's office. 
      <p>INT. PRINCIPAL WOOD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Buffy looks around at Wood's stuff. Files on his desk, diplomas on his 
      walls, books on his shelves... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Now, if I were a sign of being evil,<br/>where would I 
      be?</center>
<p>She sees a foot-locker sized chest against a wall and goes to it, 
      curious. She's got a hand on it, ready to open it when WOOD ENTERS. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>Buffy? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>HEY! Principal Wood! It's you! 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Looking for something? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>YES! File folders! And mechanical<br/>pencils. I wanted to 
      write on a file<br/>folder with a mechanical pencil. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>The supply cabinet in the outer<br/>office has those things. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh... so this isn't the... the supply<br/>cabinet. Right. Well, 
      thanks!</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy is almost out the door when he stops her. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>Hey, Buffy. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yes?</p></center>
<p>He steps over close to her. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>What are you doing tonight? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Preparing for tomorrow's counseling<br/>sessions.</p></center>
<p>He smiles charmingly. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>No, really. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Watching a reality show about a<br/>millionaire. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Well, then... I'd like to take you<br/>out to dinner if that's 
      all right<br/>with you.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy is a little shaken... did he catch her? What's he up to? She 
      hesitates. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>You don't have to. I'm certainly not<br/>saying 
      "come to dinner if you enjoy<br/>having a job."<br/>(realizes)<br/>I may have 
      to make up a little<br/>document saying I didn't say that and<br/>have you 
      sign it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'd... sure, I'd be happy to have<br/>dinner with you. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I'll draw up the paperwork.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy exits, looking dazed and worried. 
      <p>After a beat, Wood closes the door. Then he removes an ornate knife 
      from under his suit coat and uses a handkerchief to wipe it clean of (red) 
      blood... puts it in the chest, which we now see is full of other nasty 
      looking weapons (mostly ornate knives and sabers, no stakes.)

      <p>After school. Buffy is talking to Willow. Willow is folding socks from 
      a laundry basket. They're talking excitedly. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>He asked you out to dinner? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. Isn't that weird? He's a<br/>principal. A young hot 
      principal<br/>with earrings, but a principal. Why<br/>do you suppose he 
      asked me out? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well, I assume it's not 'cause he<br/>likes your 
      company.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy shoots her a look. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Unless it is. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't know. When he looks at me,<br/>he's like intense, you 
      know? There's<br/>eye contact with all four of our<br/>eyes. He could be 
      interested, right? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Sure. You're a frisky vixen. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Or it could be work-related. Maybe<br/>I'm getting promoted for 
      doing a good<br/>job.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow laughs at the idea. Then catches herself. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Oh. Right. That would make sense<br/>too. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Or maybe he knows I suspect he's up<br/>to something, and he's 
      taking me out<br/>to kill me. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You'll have to dress for the<br/>ambiguity. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's not even that his behavior's<br/>that suspicious. But 
      there he is,<br/>right over the Hellmouth all day<br/>every day. It's gotta 
      be like being<br/>showered with evil, only from<br/>underneath. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Not really a shower. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>A bidet, then. A bidet of evil. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Can we go back to the eye contact?<br/>I mean, Buff, if he 
      really is<br/>interested in you... are you<br/>interested back?</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy considers. Then. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Good god, how many socks are in there?</center>
<p>Willow looks. She's been folding socks this whole time. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>They're the Potentials'. Turns out,<br/>they each have 
      two feet. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well we'll see about that when the<br/>fighting 
      starts.<br/>(beat)<br/>I didn't mean that. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>But you did duck the question. Are<br/>you interested in 
      Principal Wood? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh, Will. I don't know. He's very<br/>good-looking. And funny 
      and solid<br/>and... normal, <u>so</u> not the wicked<br/>energy, which is 
      nice, because I<br/>don't want to be attracted only to<br/>the wicked 
      energy... unless he <u>is</u><br/>wicked, in which case, is that why 
      I<br/>like him? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm gonna wait for that sentence to<br/>come 'round again 
      before I jump on. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Anyway, yeah. I like him. And it<br/>might be good for me. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Right. You could move on.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks at her sharply. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Move on? Does everyone in this house<br/>think I'm in love 
      with Spike? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I meant move on from this imposed<br/>super-self-reliance. Let 
      someone get<br/>close. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh--</p></p></center>
<p>Front door opens. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>(quickly)<br/>Hey, someone's home!</center>
<p>Xander enters and hurries over, excited. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Guys! Guess what happened? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Buffy got a date! 
      <p>XANDER<br/>No! I did!<br/>(then)<br/>Fine. Way to steal my thunder. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Sorry. It's Principal Wood and I<br/>think he's aligned with 
      The First. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Also, like, ten years older than you,<br/>right? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Which makes him, like a hundred years<br/>younger than your 
      "type." 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yay, someone who doesn't remember the<br/>industrial 
      revolution. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I think they're gonna end up making<br/>out. "Oh, Principal 
      Wood," she'll<br/>gasp, "I love your lack of wicked<br/>energy..." 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Be quiet, Willow, or we're gonna make<br/>you talk about your 
      new girlfriend<br/>who you hold hands with under the<br/>dinner table and 
      think we don't<br/>notice. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(quickly)<br/>How 'bout yours, Xander? Is she evil? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Well she's interested in me, so<br/>there's a good chance. But 
      I'm<br/>hoping for the best. We're going<br/>bowling and she has a kayak. 
      Hey,<br/>that's a lot of socks.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles enters through the front door with Chao-Ahn. They both carry 
      shopping bags. They join the others in the living room, but don't sit 
      down. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Dear Lord, I hate that mall. The<br/>clerks are rude and 
      everything in the<br/>food court is sticky. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Looks like you found her some stuff. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>That's gotta be rough, getting just,<br/>like, pulled outta 
      your home, told<br/>you're a Potential Slayer, no chance<br/>to bring 
      anything... 
      <p>GILES<br/>And this language barrier is<br/>formidable. I was concerned 
      because<br/>my Cantonese's a little... thin...<br/>and then it turns out she 
      speaks<br/>Vietnamese, which is... thinner. But<br/>we muddled though. And, 
      as I<br/>suspected, ice-cream is the universal<br/>language. 
      <p>CHAO-AHN<br/>(subtitled)<br/>Like many from Asia, I am 
      lactose-<br/>intolerant. I'm very uncomfortable. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(to Giles)<br/>What did she say? 
      <p>GILES<br/>She is grateful to be in a land of<br/>plenty.<br/>(loudly to 
      Chao-Ann)<br/>LET'S GO PUT AWAY THE NEW CLOTHES.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They exit Chao-Ahn following Giles resignedly, leaving Buffy, Xander 
      and Willow alone again. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hey, Will, I wonder if you can do a<br/>computer check on 
      Principal Wood for<br/>me. See what you can find? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Sure. I'll have the Potentials help<br/>out. It'll be a 
      learning exercise.<br/>Want me to check out your girl at the<br/>same time, 
      Xand? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Nope. I'm going in blind. I'm gonna<br/>be an optimist about 
      this. Why look<br/>for trouble? If it's gonna find you,<br/>it's gonna find 
      you.</p></p></center>
<p>And the camera travels to the kitchen where we find... 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUING 
      <p>Andrew setting the clock on the new microwave (the now-empty box sits 
      on the floor.) He's consulting the manual. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>"Getting the most out of your new<br/>microwave." Ooh, 
      nice.<br/>(flipping pages)<br/>"clock, comma, setting the" page 3... 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST (O.S.)<br/>You don't need a manual! 
      It's<br/>intuitive!</p></center>
<p>Andrew whirls, startled, to see JONATHAN. The manual shoots out of his 
      hand, he turns so fast. Jonathan is wearing the black outfit in which he 
      died - but not cut or stained or dirty. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN/FIRST (cont'd; O.S.)<br/>There's a button marked "clock 
      set,"<br/>for pity's sake. What kind of a nerd<br/>are you? No wonder you 
      crashed your<br/>jet pack. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Oh! Oh! Get thee behind me! I<br/>rebuke thee!</p></center>
<p>Andrew fumbles in his pocket, pulls out a small cross (a few inches 
      tall.) He thrusts it at Jonathan. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>Take that, The First!</center>
<p>Jonathan sighs. 
      <center>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>Look, you monkey...</center>
<p>Jonathan PUTS HIS HAND RIGHT THROUGH THE CROSS. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN/FIRST (cont' d)<br/>Ooh! Ow! It burns as it 
      passes<br/>ineffectually through me! I'm not<br/>corporeal, remember? Also, 
      not a<br/>vampire. So, a cross?</center>
<p>Andrew puts the cross down. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>What do you want from me, Jonathan-<br/>slash-The-First? 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>I have an assignment for you. An<br/>assignment from 
      beyond the grave. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I follow Buffy's orders now. I'm<br/>redeeming myself for 
      killing you...<br/>I mean, for killing Jonathan. 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>Really? Why? So you can earn a spot<br/>on her little 
      pep squad? You think<br/>she'll ever let you in? You're a<br/>murderer. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Confidentially, a lot of her people<br/>are murderers. Anya 
      and Willow and<br/>Spike... 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>Interesting. And you're the only one<br/>that she 
      makes seek redemption? Does<br/>that seem fair to you? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I guess not. 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>You know we're headed toward a fight,<br/>don't you? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Yeah. 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>What do you think the world's gonna<br/>be like after 
      that? News flash,<br/>there's not gonna be a Slayer-gang<br/>anymore. But 
      there is going to be<br/>evil. And as long as there is evil,<br/>I live. And 
      as long as I live, you<br/>can dwell at my side. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>That sounds nice. 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>And your assignment won't be hard.<br/>They're just 
      little girls. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>You want me to hurt the girls? 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>Not all of them. Not Dawn, not Anya.<br/>Not Willow 
      and not your friend Buffy.<br/>Just the Potential Slayers. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>That's horrible! I'm going to scream<br/>and get Buffy in 
      here.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Andrew draws a big breath for screaming with. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>She can't see me. I'll still be<br/>here, and I'm 
      gonna keep talking 'til<br/>you hear what I have to say. So<br/>listen up, 
      okay? The girls must die.</center>
<p>Andrew lets out the breath. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>I could never do that. All those<br/>girls, all that 
      blood. I didn't like<br/>the stabbing before. 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>You don't have to stab. This'll be<br/>easy. Andrew, 
      think about it.<br/>Willow brought something to this<br/>house. Something 
      good. Something<br/>you can use. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>The new microwave. 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/><u>The gun</u>. I want you to think hard.<br/>Where 
      did they put the gun?</p></p></p></center>
<p>And Andrew thinks. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Hmm.</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - BATHROOM/HALLWAY - LATER 
      <p>In the bathroom, Anya is helping Buffy by scrubbing at a stain on 
      Buffy's blouse. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>I don't think it's really a date,<br/>that's what I think. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, it is unclear. That's why I<br/>chose a top that says 
      "I'm<br/>comfortable in a stodgy office or a<br/>swingin' casual setting or 
      killing<br/>you because you're a demon." 
      <p>ANYA<br/>It also says "I spilled grape juice."<br/>I'm not sure I can fix 
      this. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh, okay.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy takes off the blouse. She's wearing a lacey bra underneath. As 
      she does this, Anya continues: 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>I wasn't talking about your date<br/>anyway. I'm talking 
      about this sham<br/>date of Xander's. I think this is<br/>part of plan to 
      make me jealous. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(wryly)<br/>But it's not working. ANYA<br/>Are you nuts? Of 
      course it's<br/>working! Observe my bitter ranting!<br/>Hear the shrill edge 
      of hysteria in<br/>my voice! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh. Okay. Look, I've gotta pick out<br/>another top... 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Fine, go. Leave me to stew in my<br/>impotent rage.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy hesitates in the doorway, unsure if she should leave Anya alone. 
      After a beat. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>I'm also gonna pee, so you should<br/>probably 
      go.</center>
<p>Buffy exits into the hall, wearing the bra and carrying the blouse. 
      She's startled to find Spike there. Her first instinct is to hide her 
      half-dressed state, but she realizes there's no point. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You look nice. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh. Thanks. Traditionally, one<br/>wears something over this. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Heard you got a date.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy casually covers herself with the stained blouse. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>That's not clear, I've got this<br/>whole theory about a 
      promotion. Or<br/>he's evil. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Buffy, I'm all right. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You don't have to... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>What? Be noble? I'm not. I really<br/>am all right. You think I 
      still<br/>dream of a crypt for two with a white<br/>picket fence? My eyes 
      are clear. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(tiny bit<br/>disappointed)<br/>Good. I'm glad. Thank you. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(tries a little joke)<br/>Don't care for picket fences 
      anyway.<br/>Bloody dangerous. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Right. And, hey... you should do<br/>this too. Go out sometime 
      I mean.<br/>There was the girl you took to Xander<br/>and Anya's 
      not-a-wedding.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They might even realize at this point that they're causing each other 
      pain... but they can't stop. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Right. There's always girls who like<br/>the look. Bad 
      boy, you know, does it<br/>for some of 'em. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Sure I can see that.<br/>(beat)<br/>I... gotta go. I don't wanna 
      be late.</p></center>
<p>INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander is sitting at the bowling alley snack counter, drumming his 
      fingers nervously and looking at the clock. The clock reads 8:30. It 
      should read like he got stood up. 
      <p>Xander looks around, and is clearly surprised when he sees Maya 
      approaching. He gets up to meet her. (He shouldn't touch her so we can 
      play a certain joke later.) 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Maya, hi! I was afraid you weren't<br/>coming. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>We said eight-thirty, right? Did you<br/>think I was gonna stand 
      you up? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Well, it would be kinda karmic. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>What? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Forget it. I'm glad you're here.<br/>You wanna get a lane? 
      <p>MAYA<br/>Sure. Or we could sit here and make<br/>fun of others as they 
      bowl. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(realizing)<br/>You don't bowl. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>Not really. But I am good at<br/>pointing and mocking. Are 
      you<br/>disappointed? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Will you be pointing at or mocking me<br/>at any point? 
      <p>MAYA<br/>Not when you can see me. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Then I'm in.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow is at the computer. Dawn and Kennedy and Amanda look on. Kennedy 
      leans on Willow's shoulder - they're clearly a couple. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Nothing? No records or certificates<br/>or college 
      transcripts? 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>Looks like the only stuff in the<br/>system about Principal 
      Robin Wood is<br/>super recent. Like, since he moved<br/>to Sunnydale. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I've Googled 'til I just can't Google<br/>no more. He's not in 
      there. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Well, that's suspicious. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>And it doesn't leave a lot of<br/>options. Either this guy has 
      lived<br/>completely under the radar his whole<br/>life, or he only recently 
      came into<br/>existence, or maybe he just took on<br/>a new identity, or 
      he's a computer<br/>whiz who covered his own tracks.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>After a beat. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>That sounded like kind of a lot of<br/>options.</center>
<p>Anya enters, Giles following. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Anya, calm down. They're educational.</center>
<p>Anya marches over to Willow and hands her a stack of large white cards. 

      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>What's this? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Giles made them for Chao-Ahn and now<br/>she's locked herself in 
      the bathroom.<br/>There's a lot of girls up there and<br/>they're starting 
      to complain. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Those are flashcards. I made them to<br/>facilitate her 
      training. Chao-Ahn<br/>never had a Watcher, and with the<br/>language 
      problem... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You showed her these?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow holds up two of the cards... they show vocabulary words with 
      drawings of the style Giles used in "Hush." 
      <p>The one labeled "BRINGER" shows an eyeless figure slashing a small girl 
      with a long knife. 
      <p>The one labeled "VAMPIRE" shows the same girl being neck- bit, blood 
      drops scattering. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I wanted her to understand the<br/>seriousness of her 
      situation.</center>
<p>Dawn picks up another and looks at it. This one is labeled "TUROK-HAN," 
      and it shows the Ubervamp standing over the girl who lies IN TWO PIECES at 
      his feet in a pool of blood. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Holy crap. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Perhaps I'll rethink the approach. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Meantime, you wanna join us in the<br/>researchy? We're trying 
      to invade<br/>Buffy's date's privacy. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy has a date? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Oh yes, didn't you hear? Everyone<br/>has a date. Buffy has a 
      date,<br/>Willow's been completely making out<br/>with this girl...</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Anya points at Kennedy. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Hey! 
      <p>ANYA<br/>...and Xander's out with some<br/>hardware store whore. It's 
      date-fest<br/>two-thousand-and-three! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Buffy's actually investigating<br/>Principal Wood. It's not a 
      date. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(mollified)<br/>Really? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It might be a date. 
      <p>GILES<br/>For god's sake! How can anyone be<br/>thinking about their 
      social life?<br/>We're about to fight the original,<br/>most primal evil, 
      and these girls are<br/>all in mortal danger!</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>ANGLE ON GILES from some distance away... someone's POV. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>Didn't you see the flash cards?!</center>
<p>ANGLE ON: the doorway. Andrew watches them surreptitiously -- that was 
      his POV we saw. And he's looking somewhat like he might jump out and shoot 
      everyone. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.S.)<br/>This isn't right!</center>
<p>EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
      <p>Principal Wood and Buffy and both dressed for their date. Buffy carries 
      a small evening purse. They have just turned into an alley. It's not dirty 
      or especially narrow, but it's dark and it's an alley (no dumpsters or 
      stacked crates.) 
      <p>Buffy hesitates. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>This isn't right. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I know it doesn't look promising, but<br/>I swear this place is 
      great, the best-<br/>kept secret in town. It's just down<br/>this 
      way.</p></center>
<p>They head into the alley. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Well, it is one of the nicer dark<br/>alleys. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I promise, it's just a little<br/>further.</p></center>
<p>THREE VAMPS JUMP OUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM, vamped-out and snarling. 
      <p>THEN two other vamps (FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE) EMERGE FROM THE SHADOWS ALL 
      AROUND THEM. THEY ARE SURROUNDED! 
      <p>The three in front charge at Buffy. (We lose track of Wood here, and 
      just follow Buffy's actions.) 
      <p>She vaults over one to land on the back of another, staking him through 
      the back, and landing on the ground on all fours when HE DUSTS under her, 
      then kicking out with her feet from that position to repel the other 
      two... 
      <p>She pulls a stake from her purse and DUSTS a second one. But is 
      blindsided by the last one and lands flat on her back. 
      <p>She flips to a sitting position and DUSTS the last one from there. 
      <p>She turns on Principal Wood. 
      <p>ON BUFFY FOR: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You set me up! You son of a what?</center>
<p>HER POV: 
      <p>Principal Wood is fighting two vamps, stake in hand. He dusts them, 
      DUST-DUST, fast and efficient. 
      <p>He helps Buffy up. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>I guess we should talk.</center>

<p>INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander and Maya continue their date. The snack counter in front of them 
      is littered with soda cans and food wrappers. 
      <p>
<center>MAYA<br/>And you still have to see her, like,<br/>every day? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yeah. But I guess that's good. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>How is that good? I mean, it sounds<br/>like she never lets you 
      forget what<br/>happened. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Well, it's on her mind right now, I<br/>think, because our 
      anniversary just<br/>happened. I mean it would've been<br/>our anniversary. 
      And maybe I<br/>shouldn't be allowed to forget it.<br/>I did... It was a bad 
      thing. It hurt<br/>her a lot. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>And if you'd gone ahead with it,<br/>married her even though you 
      had<br/>doubts... would that've been better? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I guess not. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>It sounds to me like, in the long<br/>run, you're both better 
      off.<br/>(smiles)<br/>I know it turned out good for me, and<br/>that's what 
      really matters, right?</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He smiles, then hesitates, touches her arm, checking for tangibility. 
      She looks confused. 
      <p>
<center>MAYA (cont'd)<br/>What-- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Never mind. We're good. I should've<br/>taken you on a nicer

<p>She smiles. 
      <p>
<center>MAYA<br/>Well, I <u>can</u> think of something fun 
      to<br/>do.</center>
<p>INT. BISTRO - NIGHT 
      <p>BUFFY and Wood are being seated at an intimate candle-lit table in this 
      romantic little French restaurant. They set aside their menus. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Ooh, nice place and how the hell did<br/>you do that? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I've had a little practice. Never<br/>took on two at once 
      before, but I've<br/>taken out a vamp here or there, and<br/>some demons. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Just kinda... freelance? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Freelance. Yes, I guess that would<br/>be a good way to put it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And you know who I am? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>You're the Slayer. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Right. So... I'm guessing you work<br/>in an office about 
      fifteen feet over<br/>a Hellmouth because you love<br/>educational 
      administration. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I actually do enjoy the work, but<br/>you're right, I maneuvered 
      myself<br/>into that school, that office, just-<br/>like I maneuvered you 
      there. The<br/>Hellmouth draws the bad things in<br/>close. And now we're 
      headed for<br/>something big, Buffy, and I need to<br/>be here when it 
      happens. I want to<br/>help. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So I wasn't hired for my counseling<br/>skills?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Wood laughs. Then off her look. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>They're valuable too. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Why didn't you tell me about you<br/>earlier? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I wasn't sure about things yet. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You weren't sure you could trust me. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>No. I wasn't sure I was ready yet.<br/>Ready to jump into the 
      fight. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And now you are? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Now the fight is starting. Or<br/>starting to start. And I don't 
      have<br/>time to worry anymore. I have to do<br/>something.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy considers. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You knew I was the Slayer before you<br/>got here. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Yes. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>How? How do you know about Slayers? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Right. Okay. See, when I was a<br/>little boy I had a mother who 
      was<br/>one. The one. The Slayer. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're-- My god. I didn't know any<br/>Slayers had children. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I don't know of any others. Anyway,<br/>she was killed when I 
      was four. I<br/>remember her a little, but it's<br/>fuzzy, you know? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Something got her? A demon or a... 
      <p>WOOD<br/>A vampire. I went through this whole<br/>avenging son phase in 
      my twenties,<br/>but I never found who did it. So now<br/>I just dust as 
      many of 'em as I can<br/>find. Figure eventually I'll get<br/>him. That's 
      probably why we got<br/>jumped. I'm not very popular with<br/>the bumpy 
      forehead crowd. Bet you<br/>aren't either. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Not most of 'em, no. Are you... do<br/>you have Slayer powers? 
      I mean, I<br/>just... I'm floored by this... I<br/>don't even know what to 
      ask. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I don't have powers. No super-<br/>strength or mythic 
      responsibilities.<br/>Just a guy with a few skills because<br/>her Watcher 
      took me in and raised me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>In Beverly Hills. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>See now, that detail takes the edge<br/>off my Little Orphan 
      Robin story, but<br/>yeah, that was true. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So you decided to tell me. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>That's right. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>In a darkened little romantic French<br/>restaurant. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Um, yeah I'm not sure how that<br/>happened.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Andrew is talking with Jonathan/First in the living room. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN/ FIRST<br/>Did you find the gun? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Yes. It was in Buffy's underwear<br/>drawer. She has nice 
      things. 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>Show me. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Well, I didn't take 'em, but there<br/>were thongs and also 
      regular<br/>underpants-- 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>Show me <u>the gun</u>. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Oh. Here.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Andrew picks up a paper bag and opens it so Jonathan can look inside 
      (without touching the bag) -- the gun is there. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>She tried to shoot Kennedy with 
      that.<br/>(realizing)<br/>Hey, shooting Kennedy. Isn't that<br/>weird? 
      <p>JONATHAN/ FIRST<br/>It's great. There's gonna be panic<br/>and fleeing 
      when you start firing, so<br/>you're gonna hafta get 'em all<br/>trapped 
      somewhere like the basement. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>And we're killing them because... 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>Because they're the future of the<br/>Slayer line. 
      When they're gone, the<br/>line is gone. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Uh-huh, uh-huh. Hey, why not have<br/>Spike do it? He's the 
      one with the<br/>trigger. 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>It's not time for him yet. You can<br/>wait for the 
      next time they're<br/>training in the basement. But don't<br/>just rely on a 
      locked door to keep<br/>'em in, you'll need more. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Okay.<br/>(probing)<br/>Say, do you have any weaknesses 
      I<br/>should know about, if I'm gonna work<br/>for you? Like kryptonite 
      or<br/>allergies...? 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>What are you asking?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Andrew is toying dangerously with the gun-bag now, trying to be 
      super-casual. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Oh, nothing. Are you made out of the<br/>evil impulses of 
      humans? So, like,<br/>if everyone was unconscious at the<br/>same time, you 
      would fade away?</center>
<p>Jonathan stares at him... 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>You're asking a lot of questions. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Well, yes. Because I'm evil and I<br/>want to do the best I 
      can at that.<br/>So I want to know stuff. Like, when<br/>do we kill Buffy? 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>Are you wearing a wire?</p></p></center>

<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
      <p>Where Willow, Kennedy, Amanda and Dawn are sitting at a table in front 
      of listening equipment (some kind of radio receiver I imagine?) Willow has 
      on headphones and frowns, concentrating. 
      <p>Suddenly, Willow jumps and rips the headphones off. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>What's going on? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>The First. It screamed...<br/>(then)<br/>I think it knows about 
      the wire. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I didn't hear that. They're just in<br/>the next room. 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>But you heard it over the wire? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Only that. The whole rest of the<br/>time, Andrew's voice is 
      fine, but in<br/>between is just silence or static. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I guess that's what you'd expect. 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>Poor Andrew. He must be scared.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING 
      <p>Andrew and Jonathan are where we left them. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>You think you can trick The First?<br/>You think 
      you can squirm free? I<br/>hold you, Andrew. I made you do 
      <u>this</u>.</center>
<p>Jonathan presses his hands to his belly, then turns them palm out to 
      Andrew. His hands are red with blood. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>Jonathan suffered. He was 
      your<br/>friend and he trusted you, and he<br/>spends eternity in pain 
      because of<br/>what you did. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>No!</p></center>
<p>Andrew is staring, terrified at Jonathan. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>What's happening to you?</center>
<p>ANGLE ON JONATHAN. He's looking bad, decomposey, flesh starting to 
      rot... 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>This is what you did to him. Took<br/>away 
      everything that he was and left<br/>him like this. You started down 
      a<br/>road with that action. You have to<br/>keep going.</center>
<p>Andrew stares at Jonathan... steeling himself. He makes a decision. A 
      big hero moment. Low and calm and measured: 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>(steely)<br/>Stop looking like Jonathan. You're<br/>not 
      him. You're The First and you're<br/>trying to get me to shoot 
      innocent<br/>girls. But I won't do it. I'm good<br/>now and after the fight 
      is over I'm<br/>going to pay for killing Jonathan. 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>You're gonna pay for more than that.<br/>Know why? 
      Because the biggest,<br/>baddest, first evil in the world is<br/>angry with 
      you.</p></center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUING 
      <p>Willow, Kennedy, Amanda and Dawn still there. Willow is putting the 
      headphones back on. A WHISPERING FILLS THE ROOM -- IT'S JONATHAN'S VOICE, 
      but altered -- raspy, spooky. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN/FIRST (V.O.)<br/>You think this was smart? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm hearing something.</p></center>
<p>Kennedy takes the headphones off Willow. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN/FIRST (V.O.)<br/>You think you can trick me, women? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>It's not in the headphones. It's out<br/>here. 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST (V.O.)<br/>You only hear what I want you to<br/>hear. You 
      only see what I want you<br/>to see.</p></p></center>
<p>And Jonathan appears in front of them, truly hideous now, an 
      asymmetrical lump of rotten flesh. Amanda SCREAMS. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Go away! 
      <p>JONATHAN/FIRST<br/>So many dead girls. There will be 
so<br/>many.</p></center>
<p>And Jonathan FADES AWAY. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
      <p>We see all of this at once: Xander, his face bruised, has his hands 
      tied over his head and he is being hoisted by Maya's newly hoisted rope on 
      the same device that Spike was tortured on. Beneath his feet is the SEAL 
      OF DANTHALZAR, which is now uncovered again. (A shovel leans against the 
      wall.) 
      <p>Maya, now wearing a slinky midriff-baring dark-priestess outfit, is 
      doing the hoisting by pure brute strength -- it's not even difficult for 
      her. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(resigned)<br/>I knew it. See, I knew it. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>Thanks for your help selecting the<br/>rope. The one I'd picked 
      out wasn't<br/>strong enough. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yeah. That would've been bad.<br/>(then)<br/>Listen, is this 
      because I'm friends<br/>with Buffy? 
      <p>MAYA<br/>Who's Buffy? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>The Slayer. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>(impressed)<br/>You know the Slayer? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Forget it. Are you affiliated with<br/>Vengeance Demons? 
      <p>MAYA<br/>No. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Competitive witches? 
      <p>MAYA<br/>No. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Did you hatch out of a praying mantis<br/>egg in the old high 
      school? 
      <p>MAYA<br/>Gotta say no. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>This can't just happen. It can't<br/>just keep happening that 
      demon women<br/>are attracted to me! 
      <p>MAYA<br/>You seemed like a nice guy, that's<br/>all. Do the ropes hurt? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yes.

<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow, Kennedy, Amanda, Dawn and the pale huddled Andrew are briefing 
      Anya and Spike and Giles on what just happened with The First. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>(to Anya, Spike,<br/>Giles)<br/>So, we're thinking, it 
      didn't go too<br/>well.</center>
<p>Andrew is holding his shirt up and Dawn is peeling the tape off his 
      chest that holds the wire in place. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(re: tape removal)<br/>You shoulda let me do this fast. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>No, I hate that. Ooh, ow. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You tried to record the ultimate<br/>evil? Why? In a complex 
      effort to<br/>royally piss it off? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Guess we succeeded pretty good, huh? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Oh, god. I never should've gone in<br/>wired. Redemption is 
      hard. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Back to Spike's question. Why <u>did</u><br/>you try to record 
      it? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(re: tape)<br/>Ouch. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>To study it, see if we could figure<br/>something out from 
      what it was<br/>saying. Because, guys, we've gotta<br/>face it, we know 
      nothing about The<br/>First. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(again with the tape)<br/>Ow. Eep. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Well, now we know not to record it.<br/>So that's something. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Why'd it appear to...<br/>(can't think of name)<br/>...this one, 
      then? Thought it was<br/>s'posed to be pulling <u>my</u> strings.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Dawn is finished removing the wire. Andrew rubs his chest. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>It said it wasn't time for you yet.</center>
<p>As Spike absorbs that non-comforting news, the girls exchange looks -- 
      they know this means Spike could be a danger to them. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>I'm frightened and my chest hurts<br/>where the 
      tape was. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's okay, Andrew. You did good.<br/>You stood up to it, that's 
      really<br/>amazing. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>Thank you. You're a peach. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I wasn't here but I imagine it was a<br/>very manly display 
      of<br/>hyperventilating. What did it want<br/>you to do, anyway? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Shoot all the girls. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Shoot girls? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Not you. Just the Potentials. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(relieved)<br/>Well that's something 
      anyway.<br/>(coverinq)<br/>Something <u>tragic</u>. 
      <p>GILES<br/>This proves my point. This is a<br/>crucial time. We need to 
      circle our<br/>wagons and stop doing things like<br/>going out on dates 
      while there's<br/>imminent gunplay! Willow, call<br/>Buffy, get her back 
      here. We have to<br/>dispose of that gun and figure out<br/>our next step. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I can go get her-- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'll call.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow has her phone out, and is about to dial, when it RINGS. 
      <p>
<center>AMANDA<br/>Bet that's her. Sometimes you're<br/>thinking about 
      calling someone-- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No. It's a text message. Oh! It's<br/>from Xander. It's one of 
      our signals. 
      <p>AMANNDA<br/>Signals? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It's a system we set up a while back.<br/>Like, 
      codes.<br/>(looking at phone)<br/>This is either the one for "I just<br/>got 
      lucky, don't call me for a while"<br/>or "my date's a demon who's trying 
      to<br/>kill me." 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>You don't remember which? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It was long time ago! 
      <p>DAWN<br/>If we play the percentages... 
      <p>GILES<br/>Something's eating Xander's head. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Say, that's gratifying. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Buffy will know what to do. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I'll go get her--</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow is already dialing the phone... 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>That's okay.</center>
<p>A PHONE RINGS. Everyone looks around. Buffy's phone is lying on an end 
      table. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>That's not good.

      <p>WOOD<br/>Isn't it good? They soak the pears<br/>in brandy. Here, you need 
      a bite<br/>with the sauce...</p></center>
<p>He loads up his own fork and offers it across the table for her. She 
      leans in, and has his fork in her mouth when she becomes aware of SOMEONE 
      STANDING AT THE TABLE. 
      <p>Her mouth still on Wood's fork, she looks up to see Spike. (By the way, 
      he's not wearing his duster.)

<p>She pulls back, swallows her mouthful. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>What's wrong? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Is there a problem?</p></center>
<p>Spike doesn't look at Wood, keeps his eyes on Buffy.

<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander is now suspended about six feet off the floor from loops of rope 
      around his chest and waist and legs, parallel to the floor and facing

      <p>
<center>MAYA<br/>(plucky)<br/>Well, this is gonna work great. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Look, I've... I <u>know</u> what happens if<br/>that Seal down 
      there gets all<br/>excited. I don't think you<br/>understand what you're 
      getting<br/>yourself into. 
      <p>MAYA<br/>The Seal opens up and a vicious feral<br/>vampire creature comes 
      out. A Turok-<br/>Han of my very own. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Well, then, you do understand, but<br/>what makes you think 
      that's, like, a<br/>good idea? 
      <p>MAYA<br/>The end is coming. The final fight.<br/>And everyone is hearing 
      the drumbeat.<br/>It's telling us to pick our partners,<br/>align ourselves 
      with the good or the<br/>evil.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Maya turns away from camera to pick up a sword leaning against the wall 
      When she turns back her EYES ARE YELLOW (scary contact lenses.) 
      <p>She thrusts the sword up at Xander, stabbing him in the chest. Xander 
      SCREAMS. 
      <p>BLOOD RUNS DOWN THE SWORD AND DRIPS ONTO THE SEAL.

      not<br/>arrows, it's gonna be tight down<br/>there. We need blades.</center>
<p>Wood opens the weapons chest. He picks up the knife we saw earlier and 
      hands it to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>My best one. I took out a Durrith<br/>Demon with it myself 
      yesterday.</center>
<p>Buffy tests the blade as she says. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Thanks.</center>
<p>Wood picks up a similar knife for himself. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>(to Spike)<br/>Help yourself.</center>
<p>Spike picks out a knife much larger than Wood's. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Let's go.</center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander is still hanging and dripping blood. Maya looks on, her eyes 
      still a creepy yellow. 
      <p>The Seal is just starting to glow and shift as... 
      <p>Buffy sails into frame, catching Maya with a dramatic high kick. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(weakly)<br/>Buffy?</center>
<p>The kick sends Maya flying back, smashing into the waiting Spike. But 
      Maya is very strong and she manages to get hold of Spike, crushing him in 
      her arms. 
      <p>Wood is making his way across the room to Xander, and he looks over to 
      see: 
      <p>SPIKE YELLING with pain, and goes into VAMP-FACE. 
      <p>ON WOOD: freezing as he realizes: 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>He's a vampire.</center>
<p>Buffy is charging in to free Spike... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(to Wood)<br/>Get Xander!</center>
<p>Principal Wood stands on the Seal and starts cutting at the ropes that 
      suspend Xander. Xander's blood drips around Wood's feet. 
      <p>ANGLE ON THE SEAL, and Wood's feet, as the SEAL begins to GLOW AND 
      SHIFT. 
      <p>ON BUFFY AND SPIKE as they fight Maya. She throws BUFFY across the room 
      with a backhand, and sends Spike flying with a kick... 
      <p>BACK TO THE SEAL. Wood staggers. A triangle of the Seal is cracked 
      open, and a TUROK HAN ARM APPEARS. It grabs at Wood's leg! 
      <p>But Wood manages to free Xander and THROW HIM away from the seal, 
      cutting off the supply of blood. 
      <p>The triangle slams shut, severing and crushing the arm!! The Turok Han 
      SCREAMS. 
      <p>Buffy and Spike rally against MAYA. Spike's face is cut and bleeding, 
      but they're working well together. 
      <p>Spike launches himself at Maya, hitting her high, and knocking her 
      back. Buffy is ready, and when Maya flips to her feet, BUFFY swings her 
      blade... 
      <p>Cutting Maya's head off. The headless body MORPHS into A LARGE SCARY 
      HEADLESS DEMON which collapses and dies. 
      <p>ANGLE ON: Wood, who is kneeling over Xander on the floor. He watches 
      closely to see what happens next. Which is... 
      <p>BUFFY goes to Spike. Not looking around first to check on Wood or 
      Xander. Her first priority to check Spike's injuries, make sure he's all 
      right. Spike is doing the same for her... looking into her eyes. It's a 
      brief moment, but very intimate. 
      <p>Wood clearly recognizes it for what it is -- Buffy and Spike have some 
      kind of attachment. His jaw clenches... disappointed and disgusted. 
      <p>Then BUFFY is at his side... 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>I think your friend's gonna be okay.</center>
<p>Spike joins them and Wood moves pointedly away. Spike notices. 
      <p>Buffy smooths back Xander's hair. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hi, Xand. I'm here. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(weakly, to Buffy)<br/>So how's <u>your</u> date 
      going?</p></center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER 
      <p>It's very late now. Dawn is standing just inside the open front door, 
      looking out. 
      <p>Inside the living room, Willow and Andrew are watching Anya pace 
      worriedly. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>(fretful)<br/>It's after two. I can't believe<br/>Buffy 
      hasn't brought him home yet.<br/>His slut ate him up. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>His slut didn't eat him up. Besides,<br/>I thought you were 
      all angry at him. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>My feelings are changeable but<br/>intense. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I understand your fear, Anya. I know<br/>fear myself, you 
      know, because I<br/>enraged that primal force. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Yes, but you deserve to be in<br/>trouble. I didn't kill 
      anybody.<br/>(beat)<br/>Well, not directly or 
      irreversibly.<br/>Lately.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles enters carrying a glass of milk. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>They're still not back? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I'm worried. I think we need to go<br/>find them. Xander could 
      be injured<br/>or trapped or eaten up... 
      <p>GILES<br/>It is very late. Maybe a little<br/>reconnaissance isn't out of 
      the<br/>question.</p></p></center>
<p>Chao-Ahn enters, wearing her bathrobe, looking scared. 
      <p>
<center>CHAO-AHN<br/>(subtitled)<br/>Why is everyone up? Are 
      the<br/>flashcard monsters attacking? 
      <p>GILES<br/>She says she can't sleep.<br/>(to Chao-Ahn,<br/>offering)<br/>I 
      MADE MYSELF SOME WARM MILK. YOU<br/>CAN HAVE IT!</p></center>
<p>Chao-Ahn looks with alarm at the milk, and turns to go. 
      <p>
<center>CHAO-AHN<br/>(subtitled, exiting)<br/>You're trying to kill me! 
      <p>GILES<br/>(to the others)<br/>She's shy.</p></center>
<p>Dawn reacts to something she sees outside. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>They're back! Here they come!</center>
<p>Anya hurries to her. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Is Xander all right? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>He looks okay. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Damn him!</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy, Spike and Xander enter. Xander is clearly fine. Cloth is wrapped 
      around Xander, over his torn shirt, as a makeshift bandage, but he's not 
      weak, he's full of vinegar. 
      <p>The others go to him, except for Anya, who sulks on the sofa. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>What happened? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Principal Wood's a demon-fightin' son<br/>of a Slayer. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Neat. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(that isn't what I<br/>meant)<br/>Okay. What happened to 
      Xander? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>What do you think happened? Another<br/>demon woman was 
      attracted to me! But<br/>I've got the answer! Willow! Gay me<br/>up! C'mon! 
      Let's gay! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You heard me. Tell me what to do.<br/>I'm mentally undressing 
      Scott Bakula,<br/>that's a start, right? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(dreamy)<br/>Captain Archer. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>C'mon Willow, let's get this gay show<br/>on the gay road. 
      Help me out here! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(amused)<br/>What if you just start attracting<br/>male demons? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Clem always liked you. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(muttered)<br/>Serve you right. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Children. Enough. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I'll need stylish new clothes... 
      <p>GILES<br/>STOP!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They all stare at Giles. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>Have you learned nothing from<br/>tonight's 
      assorted chaos? There's no<br/>time for fun and games and quipping<br/>about 
      orientations.</center>
<p>Giles picks up the flashcards that are still lying on a table where 
      they were put earlier. He holds them up. The "Bringer" one is on top. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>These aren't a joke. This is what<br/>happens. 
      Girls are going to die. We<br/>may die. It's time to get serious.</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. - LATER 
      <p>It's now even later and the room is darker. Buffy sits alone, slumped, 
      thinking... 
      <p>Spike enters, approaches quietly. Sits next to her. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Anyone tell you about what happened<br/>'round here 
      tonight? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Willow did. The First is back in the<br/>mix. 
      <p>SPIKES<br/>It talked to the little boy. Said<br/>it's not time for me 
      yet.</p></p></center>
<p>He pauses, but she doesn't say anything. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>I should move out. Leave town.<br/>Before it is 
      time for me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No. You have to stay. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You got another demon fighter now.<br/>Son of a Slayer at that. 

      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's not why I need you here. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>That right? Why's that then? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Because I'm not ready for you not to<br/>be here.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike looks at her, trying to read that. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>And the principal? How's he fit in? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He's a guy on our side. I can't turn<br/>away from that. 
      Something tells me<br/>I'm gonna need lots of help.</p></center>
<p>INT. PRINCIPAL WOOD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Principal Wood is washing his face at the bathroom sink when he senses 
      someone behind him. He turns to find his mother NIKKI standing there, 
      looking just as young and just as cool as she did in that subway car in 
      "Fool For Love" when she was killed. 
      <p>
<center>NIKKI /FIRST<br/>You look good.</center>
<p>Wood stays calm, very still. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>You're not my mother. 
      <p>NIKKI/FIRST<br/>I give you a compliment and you don't<br/>say thank you? 
      Did I raise you that<br/>way? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>You didn't raise me at all. 
      <p>NIKKI/FIRST<br/>Well, I was dead.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Wood WALKS THROUGH HER and turns in the doorway, looking back at her. 
      WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF HER HAVING MOVED, SHE'S NOW FACING TOWARD HIM. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>You're The First. Why are you here?<br/>Why now? 
      <p>NIKKI/FIRST<br/>'Cause you're coming up in the world.<br/>You've been 
      taking the demons out.<br/>Makes a mother proud. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Think how pleased she'll be when I<br/>help take you out. Until 
      it's time<br/>for that, I've got no use for you.</p></p></center>
<p>Wood starts to turn away. 
      <p>
<center>NIKKI/FIRST<br/>Would you like to know who killed me?</center>
<p>Wood turns back. 
      <p>
<center>NIKKI/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>I know you tried to find him. But<br/>one 
      vampire out of so many. And not<br/>much to go on. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>You don't know anything. 
      <p>NIKKI/FIRST<br/>Is that right? You can check it out<br/>after I tell you, 
      check the timing,<br/>reread what the witnesses said, the<br/>people in the 
      subway station... 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Who is it? 
      <p>NIKKI/FIRST<br/>You met him. You know him. You<br/>fought at his 
      side.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>That gets to Wood. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>Spike.</center>
<p>Nikki smiles. 
      <p>
<center>NIKKI /FIRST<br/>And what do you say? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>(softly)<br/>Thank you.</p></center>
