<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>BUFFY enters the darkened living room, camera floating before her in a 
      schmuck-baity kind of way. She shuts off the table lamp light, stops to 
      pick something up. 
      <p>We see it's a BOOK: "Cantonese For Beginners." Buffy looks at it, 
      weary, and places it atop a STACK of books. "French For Beginners," "Speak 
      Portuguese!" "Learn Swahili Now," "Spanish 101..." 
      <p>We see the living room is filled with sleeping POTENTIALS. RONA on the 
      sofa, AMANDA snuggled asleep in a chair, VI and CHAO-AHN on the floor. 
      Buffy tiptoes between them, careful not to wake them, and, after looking 
      them over like a watchful den mother, heads upstairs. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
      <p>Upstairs. Buffy gets to her bedroom door, opens it. 
      <p>Buffy's POV: We see the room is FULL of Slayer POTENTIALS. MOLLY 
      sleeping soundly in the bed. On the floor and around the room, THREE MORE 
      girls sleep. All safe. 
      <p>Buffy turns her head to look into Dawn's room, sees: 
      <p>Buffy's POV: DAWN in her bed - and SIX Potentials (all non- speaking 
      EXTRAS) packing the room, all asleep. 
      <p>BUFFY shuts the door. She hears a low MOANING SOUND. Puzzled, she turns 
      to see: 
      <p>CHLOE, the Potential, sitting at the end of the hallway, in her 
      slightly-young-looking JAMMIES, sitting huddled up against herself, 
      hugging her knees, and CRYING. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Chloe?<br/>(beat)<br/>It is Chloe, right?</center>
<p>Buffy approaches Chloe, thinking of something to say. But not without 
      suspicion as Chloe keeps crying. 
      <p>When suddenly, a FLASH of motion smashes Buffy out of frame, VIOLENTLY. 

      <p>ANGLE ON: THE STAIRS. 
      <p>Buffy and her unseen ASSAILANT come CRASHING down the stairs together. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE FOYER - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and her attacker land - WHAM! with a hard, bone rattling SLAM 
      onto the foyer floor. Buffy gets PINNED down immediately, strong hands 
      holding her shoulders tight. 
      <p>Struggling, Buffy looks up to see: THE PRIMITIVE. Looming over her, 
      peering into her eyes, intense. 
      <p>
<center>PRIMITIVE<br/>It's not enough.</center>
<p>And before Buffy can make sense of that we CUT TO: 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS HOUSE - BUFFY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy AWAKES with a start. Looks around. The room looks very much as it 
      did in the dream - sleeping Potentials (FIVE of them, NONE of whom we have 
      ever seen before) all around. Buffy gets her bearings, realizing where she 
      is. 
      <p>We hold on Buffy's face as her mind races, silently trying to figure 
      out what the hell just happened...

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>ANYA walks briskly down the street, apparently alone, talking out loud, 
      arms folded - annoyed. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>I'm a bright girl. Good education,<br/>quick on the uptake, 
      so tell me: Why<br/>in the name of almighty Grothnar did<br/>I let myself 
      become human again?</center>
<p>We see Spike lagging behind. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You're really asking the wrong fella. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I mean, sure, the Vengeance Demon gig<br/>had some downsides. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>All jobs do. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>But being human, bleah! You're<br/>always squishy on the 
      inside,<br/>disgusting on the outside... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Your outside's not so bad. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>The only thing worse than being human<br/>is being trapped in a 
      household full<br/>of humans. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Preaching to the choir, love. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>It's like we live in slayer central.<br/>I swear, if Buffy rooms 
      or boards one<br/>more of these "Potential" girls, I'm<br/>calling a health 
      inspector. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I like my plan better: get up, get<br/>out, get drunk. Repeat 
      as needed.<br/>It's just more elegant. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Thanks for having me along. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Think nothing of. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>At first, it was weird, I thought,<br/>"is he asking me out on a 
      date?"<br/>'Cause that would be...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She checks Spike's wary expression, checks herself. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>Nuts. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Right. I'm just out for the alcohol. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Right there with you, Scooter.<br/>Tonight, I'm prepared to 
      drink you<br/>under a table. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You're on, then. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Good.<br/>(beat)<br/>Of course, once you're down there I<br/>could 
      join you.<br/>(off his look)<br/>Kidding.<br/>(beat)<br/>I like my sex on top 
      of the table. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Aw, let it go, would you? You're<br/>like a dog with a bone. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>So what. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>It's my bone! Just drop it. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Okay, okay, I wasn't proposing. Time<br/>goes by, a girl gets 
      hungry. You<br/>should know. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Know what? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>You're a man. With a soul, and other<br/>working parts, and it's 
      not like<br/>Buffy's been sending any your way<br/>lately so I just 
      thought... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Oh thank God. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>What? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Demon.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>And suddenly, ANYA gets RIPPED ASIDE, out of frame revealing a 
      human-sized but nasty looking DEMON (D'KORR). Anya hits the ground. 
      <p>
<center>D'KORR<br/>D'Hoffryn says you die! 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>'Course he does.</p></center>
<p>Spike SPINS the demon to face him - and KICKS HIM IN THE NUTS. The 
      demon howls, doubling over in pain. Spike hesitates a second - then RUSHES 
      to Anya, GRABS HER. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Hey!</center>
<p>And Spike RUNS off with Anya, leaving the pained but still- standing 
      demon behind. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (PRE-LAP)<br/>This may mean more than you think.</center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>BUFFY sits in her office, looking not so happy. PRINCIPAL WOOD stands 
      beside her. Both of them looking forward. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>That so? Because I think what we<br/>have here's 
      a pair of chuckleheads<br/>who thought a cafeteria fistfight<br/>would 
      impress.</center>
<p>Reverse to show two BOY STUDENTS, looking surly and not wholly 
      contrite, who've been fighting. One with a black eye, the other's shirt's 
      been torn. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>I'm not impressed. Are you?</center>
<p>Buffy shakes her head "no." 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Still - I'll cut you some slack 
      -<br/>this time.</center>
<p>The guys get up to go. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>And if I find out you've been<br/>fighting again, I'll, 
      um... bang your<br/>heads together.</center>
<p>They go. Principal Wood takes a seat. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>That ought to make them like each<br/>other more. 

      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I doubt it. Third fight this week.<br/>And they're 
      getting worse. Plus an<br/>increase in vandalism. Three<br/>students 
      missing. Tell me, Buffy.<br/>In your professional opinion.</p></center>
<p>Three GIRLS race past Buffy's office window, rowdy, yelling. Principal 
      Wood calmly watches, then turns to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>It's started. Hasn't it? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(nods)<br/>The Hellmouth below us is starting<br/>its 
      semi-annual percolation. Usually<br/>blows around May. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Was it like this before? It seems as<br/>if things are 
      getting bad faster than<br/>we thought. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We're a little ahead of schedule. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I can't say I'm too surprised. I<br/>knew I signed on 
      for something, but<br/>Buffy, I'm just a guy.<br/>(beat)<br/>Granted, a cool 
      and sexy vampire<br/>fighting guy, but still... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You forgot snappy dresser. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>This is going to get bigger than me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. It is.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Principal Wood closes the blinds, shutting them off from view. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>And that's why I've decided to give<br/>you 
      this.</center>
<p>He lifts and places a worn old leather SATCHEL (like an old- fashioned 
      doctor's bag) upon Buffy's desk. She looks at it. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What is it? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>An emergency kit. Not sure exactly<br/>what's inside. 
      This bag belonged to<br/>my mother. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Wow. A Slayer keepsake. I couldn't. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You have to. Technically, it should<br/>have been 
      handed down through the<br/>years, directly to you. But when my<br/>Mother 
      died...<br/>(shrugs)<br/>I didn't want to part with it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Until now. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I don't know exactly what's inside,<br/>but I know 
      it's got something to do<br/>with her power. Well, your power now. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>An emergency kit. I don't know what<br/>to say. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Try saying, "thank you, Principal<br/>Wood." 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Thank you, Principal Wood. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>(dismissive wave)<br/>Please, call me Robin. And now 
      I'd<br/>like to see where you work. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Um, here we are. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>No. Where you do your other work.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - FOYER - DAY 
      <p>Buffy and Principal Wood enter the house, Buffy carrying the leather 
      bag. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>... So all these Potential Slayers,<br/>who just seemed to 
      sprout up from<br/>like every corner of the planet, were<br/>getting killed. 

      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>By The First. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Agents of. We thought the Council<br/>could protect them, but 
      no one was<br/>protecting the Council and all their<br/>Watchers were 
      killed. Since then,<br/>word got out, and they've all been<br/>coming here 
      since. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Nothing like the end of the world to<br/>bring people 
      together. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's heartwarming. Anyway, this is<br/>it: command 
      central.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Reverse to reveal the empty living room. ANDREW enters, nervous, 
      wearing OVEN MITTS. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Where the hell have you been? This<br/>funnel cake is 
      kicking my ass.</center>
<p>Beat. Buffy looks embarrassed, Principal Wood deadpan. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I hear they're tricky. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Principal Wood, meet Andrew. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Pleasure. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Mm-hmm. Welcome to our perfectly<br/>typical American 
      household where<br/>nothing unusual happens. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>This is Andrew. He's our... <br/>actually, he's our hostage. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I like to think of myself more as a<br/>(air 
      quotes)<br/>"Guest-age." 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You hold him against his will? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He was evil, people died, now he<br/>bakes. It's a 
      thing.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy starts to lead Principal Wood away. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>I prefer the term "saga," and could<br/>we try to keep 
      our secret<br/>headquarters just a little bit<br/>secret? Keep bringing 
      people in, and<br/>they'll see everything. They'll see<br/>the big board. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Andrew, we don't have a big board.</p></center>
<p>Andrew whips out a BIG BOARD. Oak tag with a hand-drawn MAP of 
      Sunnydale on it in sharpie. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Made it myself. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Wouldn't have guessed. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>This...<br/>(indicates map)<br/>...is us. This represents 
      sightings<br/>of The First in its various<br/>incarnations. No pattern to 
      the<br/>naked eye yet, but the instant one<br/>emerges, yours truly is on 
      it.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy just leads Principal Wood out. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>Where do we put our receipts?</center>
<p>EXT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 
      <p>Buffy and Principal Wood come out the Summers' house back door 
      together. Look out over the backyard... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You'll have to forgive Andrew. Or<br/>not. Your call. 
      We've got a little<br/>more than the big board working for<br/>us, anyway. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>So I see.</p></center>
<p>PULL BACK TO REVEAL: The Summers' backyard is FILLED WITH POTENTIALS, 
      (FOUR rows of FOUR, making a square of sixteen total, mostly EXTRAS, but 
      also AMANDA, CHAO-AHN, MOLLY, VI, RONA, CHLOE). 
      <p>All of them run MARTIAL ARTS DRILLS, in sync, under the guidance of 
      KENNEDY. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>(grunting)<br/>Left palm - right hook - <i>huh</i>! 
      Over,<br/>cross, under - <i>huh</i>!</center>
<p>The Potentials all punch in unison, re-set their fight stance, and 
      punch again. All but one: Chloe. Can't keep up. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>Hold it!</center>
<p>Kennedy gets in Chloe's face - the drill sergeant. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>What the hell you call that,<br/>"Potential?" 
      Try that in the field,<br/>you are dead. Drop and give me<br/>twenty. 
      <p>CHLOE<br/>T-twenty what? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Push-ups, maggot!</p></p></center>
<p>Chloe gets down and starts doing push-ups. Kennedy turns and bops over 
      to Buffy and Principal Wood. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>I love this job. D'ya see? I called<br/>that 
      girl a "maggot!"<br/>(to Wood)<br/>Hi. Who the hell are you? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>An ally. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Just asking. So what do you think?<br/>My girls ready to kick 
      some ass or<br/>what? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>(dubious)<br/>Looking strong. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>(off his reticence)<br/>"But...?" 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I'm just not sure The First has an<br/>ass you can 
      actually kick. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Guess we'll see. 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>Principal Wood! Hi! It's so weird,<br/>seeing you outside of 
      school.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Kennedy gets back to the troops, barking orders. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>What are you waving at, Potential?<br/>Bagwa Chung 
      drills - first position,<br/>double time - if it doesn't hurt 
      you,<br/>you're doing it wrong!</center>
<p>The group goes back to training. Buffy watches, ill at ease. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You're right. It's not enough. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>That's not what I said. It's an<br/>impressive group 
      of recruits. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>They're not recruits. Recruits are<br/>recruited. These girls 
      were more<br/>like... Chosen. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You're doing the best you can with<br/>what you've 
      got. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>They're not all gonna make it. Some<br/>will die. And nothing I 
      can do will<br/>stop that.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Before Wood can respond, WILLOW steps onto the porch, bearing an 
      armload of WEAPONS. She sees Principal Wood, stops. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Oh. Hey. Hi. Well, Buffy, I see<br/>our preparations for 
      the... school...<br/>pep-dance-cheer-drill-contest are<br/>really coming 
      along.<br/>(to Principal wood)<br/>"Bring it On!" 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Will, it's okay, he knows. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh, thank God.</p></p></center>
<p>She sets down the weapons. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>If I had to explain all these<br/>weapons? I had 
      nothing.<br/>(re: Kennedy)<br/>Ooh, check out my new almost-<br/>girlfriend. 
      She's so butch. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You're Willow. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You're Wood. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I've been showing him around. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Buffy tells me you've been, how shall<br/>I put it? 
      "Experimenting."</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow shoots Buffy a look. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>With the Magicks. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh. Yes. Nothing too heavy, though.<br/>Just the lighter, 
      safer stuff. And<br/>you know, I've found there's a lot of<br/>really great 
      spells you can cast<br/>without... 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Destroying the world. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Which I almost did. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>So I heard. I'm glad you decided to<br/>get back into 
      it. Must be scary. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well, that's why I'm sticking just to<br/>Magicks with little 
      training wheels<br/>on them. You know. One day at a<br/>time. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Good luck with that. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Thanks.<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>If Kennedy asks? Her pointy 
      stuff's<br/>here. See you inside, and...<br/>(re: Wood)<br/>So much cooler 
      than Snyder.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow heads inside. Buffy and Principal Wood go back to watching the 
      drills. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>That "end of the world" stuff. Was<br/>she being 
      metaphorical, or... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Literal. <p. principal="" wood<br="">Remind me to be polite with 
      her.</p.></p></center>
<p>Buffy just SIGHS. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>What is it? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I dunno, it's just, The First is<br/>coming, and look at us. 
      "The Army."<br/>We've got fighters with nothing to<br/>hit, a Wicca who 
      mostly won't-a and<br/>the brains of our operation wears<br/>oven mitts. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You're re-defining the job. That<br/>takes 
      guts.<br/>(beat)<br/>This isn't your full arsenal, anyway.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks to him. He says without looking back: 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Show me the vampire.</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY 
      <p>Buffy leads Principal Wood down the basement stairs. As they descend, 
      they hear the sounds of arguing. We see, from their POV, Anya getting in 
      Spike's face. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>...But you just let him go! 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>After saving your life. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>For now. That was one of D'Hoffryn's<br/>killers, Spike. He 
      won't stop coming<br/>'til he kills me. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Yet here you are. Walking.<br/>Breathing. Annoying. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>But you fought like such a wimp-ire,<br/>with the lifting and 
      the running.<br/>Why not just kill him?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy pauses, watching. She wants to hear the answer. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Anya, think: I fight. Demon-boy gets<br/>lucky, knocks me 
      out - you get<br/>killed. True?<br/>(beat)<br/>We both know the safest and 
      sanest<br/>way of saving your life was to keep<br/>you near me, away from 
      danger.</center>
<p>Anya, trumped, just glares, then marches up the stairs - past Buffy and 
      Principal Wood. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>No need to thank me! I'm only the<br/>one who 
      beat him off!</center>
<p>Spike stops, sees Buffy and Principal Wood watching him. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>"Repelled him," would perhaps be the<br/>better 
      phrase. Demon. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Figured. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Hope we're not intruding. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Not a bit. And just what brings our<br/>good principal to this 
      neck of the<br/>gloom? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm showing him, you know, the way we<br/>do things. Our 
      operation.<br/>(beat)<br/>Us. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Fine by me. Big fight against evil<br/>coming. The more good 
      guys we got,<br/>the longer we all live. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Is that what you are? A "good guy?" 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Haven't heard any complaints. Well,<br/>I've heard a few over 
      the years, but<br/>then I just killed whoever spoke up<br/>and that was 
      pretty much that. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He's joking. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>No he's not. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>No, I'm not. But: That's the old me<br/>I'm talking about. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Tell me about it. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Not much to tell. I've changed. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Now that you have a soul. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Yeah. It was a big deal. Very<br/>private.<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Are 
      you just telling everyone now?<br/>What are you spilling next, that 
      I<br/>bleach my hair? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I never would have guessed.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike whirls on Principal Wood. Wood remains calm. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Don't blame Buffy. I asked. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Right. The educator. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I love to learn. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>That case? Yeah. I went to great<br/>lengths, lot of trouble, 
      and now I'm<br/>unique. Well, more or less. Got<br/>myself a soul. Whatever 
      that means. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>How's it working out for you? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>In progress. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Well you've had time. Been in<br/>Sunnydale...? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Years. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>How many? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Few. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Before that? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Around. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>That covers some territory. Let me<br/>guess. 
      You're...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Wood steps closer to Spike, examining his face. Spike holds up to the 
      scrutiny, casually giving it right back. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Century old. Maybe more, not 
      much.<br/>Still, got yourself sired in the mid<br/>...late nineteenth 
      century. Close?</center>
<p>Spike doesn't answer. Wood's getting close to something, and although 
      Spike doesn't understand it - he knows he does not like it. Buffy feels 
      the tension: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>We'd better get back upstairs. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Right. Getting the full tour.</p></center>
<p>She leads Principal Wood with her, back upstairs. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>You don't want to miss a look at her<br/>weapons 
      chest.</center>
<p>Buffy and Principal Wood head up the stairs. They walk up and out of 
      frame, leaving Spike behind, watching. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY / BUFFY'S ROOM / BATHROOM - 
      NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and Dawn can be heard coming up the stairs 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>So, I took a look inside that creepy<br/>old "emergency" 
      bag of Principal<br/>Wood's? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And?</p></center>
<p>They stop in the hall. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Smelled weird. Like grandma's<br/>closet, but worse. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I didn't know that was possible.<br/>Anything we can use? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Trinkets, couple of weapons, one<br/>extra large text 
      book.</p></p></center>
<p>She holds up a large, old BOOK. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Translation's a bitch. Did you know<br/>the 
      ancient Sumerians didn't speak<br/>English? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>They're worse than the French.<br/>Anything else? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Yeah. A box. Big, fat, unopenable<br/>box. I'm betting whatever 
      the big<br/>deal about this emergency kit is,<br/>you'll find it inside the 
      box. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Good. Keep on it.<br/>(beat)<br/>And don't you have any real 
      homework? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What, like school work? I've got a<br/>system: It's called 
      flunking out!<br/>Kidding. I paid a guy to study for<br/>me. Kidding! God, I 
      love when I<br/>talk about failing, just to see your<br/>eyeballs change 
      color, it's like...</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>As Dawn talks, Buffy opens the bathroom door. Dawn SCREAMS. Buffy turns 
      to see: 
      <p>Buffy's POV: Chloe HANGS from the ceiling, her face already blue, DEAD, 
      a twisted sheet around her neck. We see her completely: Full Frontal 
      Death. 
      <p>(PRODUCTION NOTE: We do not see what she's hanging FROM - the dangling 
      body's in full view, though.) 
      <p>And she just hangs there.

      <p>Continuous. Buffy stands staring ahead. Kennedy, Rona and Amanda rush 
      toward them, still in their pajamas (or whatever they sleep in) and bunch 
      up around the bathroom door. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>What happened, we heard... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Dawn. Get a knife.<br/>(off her look)<br/>I'm cutting her 
      down.</p></center>
<p>Dawn starts to leave when a voice stops her: 
      <p>
<center>CHLOE/FIRST<br/>Good thinking.</center>
<p>Dawn stops, slowly turning, as we see, below Chloe's hanging body, THE 
      FIRST, in the form of Chloe, looking on at "her" own body. 
      <p>
<center>CHLOE/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>On the other hand, why rush? Up or<br/>down 
      - I'll still be dead. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're not Chloe. 
      <p>CHLOE/FIRST<br/>Yeah well, neither is she, anymore.<br/>Now she's just... 
      "Chloe's body 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>What did you do to her? 
      <p>CHLOE/FIRST<br/>Nothing! We just talked all night.<br/>Well, I did most 
      of the talking, but<br/>Chloe is... I'm sorry, <i>was</i> a 
      great<br/>listener. 'Til she hanged herself.<br/>(to Kennedy)<br/>Like when 
      you called her a maggot?<br/>She really heard that. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Don't listen to it. Any of you. 
      <p>CHLOE/FIRST<br/>Oh, let 'em. Chloe only offed<br/>herself because she 
      knew what you're<br/>not getting. I'm coming. You're<br/>going. All this? 
      It's almost over. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We'll be here. 
      <p>CHLOE/FIRST<br/>All of you? But wait, I thought...<br/>(in Buffy's 
      voice)<br/>"They're not all gonna make it. Some<br/>will die. And nothing I 
      can do will<br/>stop that."<br/>(regular Chloe voice)<br/>Hey, <i>I</i> 
      didn't say it. Be seeing you<br/>all. One by one. T.T.F.N.!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Chloe/First VANISHES. Leaving only real Chloe's dead body, still 
      hanging there. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>W-what's T.T.F.N.? 
      <p>RONA<br/>"Ta-Ta For Now." It's what Tigger<br/>says when he leaves. 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>Chloe loved Winnie the Pooh.<br/>(beat, deadpan)<br/>Bouncy 
      bouncy, fun fun fun.</p></p></center>
<p>Silent pause. Buffy addresses Dawn without looking at her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Dawn. Where's that knife?</center>
<p>EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy, alone in an ND field at night, finishes shoveling the last layer 
      of dirt on a small, unmarked GRAVE. It lies next to another small grave. 
      <p>BUFFY keeps digging with grim determination. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Inside Buffy's living room, a late night VIGIL. EVERYONE is here 
      Willow, Dawn, Xander, Spike, Anya, Kennedy, Rona, Amanda, Vi, Molly, 
      Chao-Ahn and every one of those EXTRAS from the backyard training session 
      (scene B). They fill the stairwell, stand or sit on the floor - wherever 
      they can fit, filling the entire space. Some of them are crying, some 
      comfort others, all of them look bereaved. 
      <p>We hear the kitchen door open and close. Buffy enters from the kitchen, 
      carrying a shovel. Stands in the center of the group. One by one, the 
      Potentials all look to her. Once she's got all their attention, Buffy 
      speaks: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Everyone here? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>All accounted for. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(nods)<br/>Anyone like to say a few words 
      about<br/>Chloe?</p></p></center>
<p>Nothing. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Let me: Chloe was an idiot.</center>
<p>This gets a few startled reactions. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Chloe was stupid, she was weak. And<br/>anyone 
      who's in a rush to become the<br/>next dead body I bury, it's easy.<br/>Just 
      think of Chloe. Do what she<br/>did. And I'll make room for you next<br/>to 
      her, and Annabelle.</center>
<p>Dawn looks around at the shocked, scared faces around her. Kennedy 
      looks the most downcast of all. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I'm the Slayer. The one with power.<br/>And The 
      First has me using that power<br/>to dig our graves.</center>
<p>Buffy punctuates the point by THROWING her shovel down. It CLATTERS to 
      the ground. Willow flinches. Kennedy sees. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I've been carrying you. All of you,<br/>too far, 
      too long. Ride's over.</center>
<p>Kennedy watches Willow - and her mood breaks. She stands. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>You're out of line. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No she's not. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>You gonna let her talk to you like<br/>that? Willow - She's 
      not even the<br/>most powerful one in this room - with<br/>you here? She's 
      not close.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy confronts Kennedy. Close. Calm. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You're new here. And you're wrong,<br/>because I use the 
      power I've got.<br/>The rest of you are all just waiting<br/>for me. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Well, yeah, but only 'cause you kinda<br/>told us to. You're 
      our leader,<br/>Buffy. As in "follow the." 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well from now on, I'm your leader as<br/>in "do what I say." 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yah... <i>voll</i>, but let's try not to<br/>forget we're also 
      you're friends. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I'm not.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy turns on Anya. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Then why are you here? Besides<br/>getting rescued, what 
      do you do? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I provide... much needed... sarcasm. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Uh, that'd be my job, actually. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're here because you're scared. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Same goes for everyone in this room. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Fine. Anya, all of you: be as scared<br/>as you like. Just be 
      useful while<br/>you're at it. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Come on, Buffy. You know everyone<br/>here's already doing 
      everything they<br/>can. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And The First isn't impressed. It<br/>already knows us. Knows 
      everything<br/>we can do, and it's laughing. You<br/>want to surprise the 
      enemy? Surprise<br/>yourselves. Force yourselves to do<br/>what can't be 
      done or else we're not<br/>an army. Just a bunch of girls<br/>waiting to be 
      picked off and buried.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Long pause as this sinks in for the group. Spike, not shy about it, 
      rises, heads out. Buffy stops him with: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Where you going? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Out. Since I'm neither a girl nor<br/>waiting, all this 
      speechifying<br/>doesn't really apply to me, does it? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Take a cell phone. That way, if I<br/>need someone to get weepy 
      or wailed<br/>on, I'll call you.</p></p></center>
<p>Spike freezes in his tracks. Turns, cold with fury. Buffy's right there 
      with him. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>If you've got something to say... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Just said it. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I don't need to be here. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Keep holding back, Spike, and you<br/>might as well walk out 
      that door. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Holding back? You're blind. I've<br/>been here, right in it. 
      Fighting.<br/>Scrapping. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Since you got your soul back? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Matter of fact. I'm just not<br/>relishing a kill the way I 
      used to. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You were a better fighter then. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I did this for you! The soul, the<br/>changes - it's what you 
      wanted. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What I want is the Spike who's<br/>dangerous. The one who tried 
      to kill<br/>me when we met. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Oh, you don't know how close you are<br/>to bringing him out. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm nowhere near him.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy speaks to Dawn without taking her eyes off Spike. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Get the Potentials upstairs. And<br/>break out 
      that emergency kit. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What are you gonna do? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Declare an emergency.</p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>BANG! Principal Wood's BAG hits the coffee table. We see Principal Wood 
      himself, looking a bit bleary-eyed but ready for action, standing over it. 

      <p>(The room has cleared out - no Potentials, just Principal Wood, Buffy, 
      Willow, Dawn, Xander, Anya and Kennedy.) 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>We thought you might want to be here. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You thought right.</p></center>
<p>We see, laid out on the table, items of MYSTICAL NATURE. Candles, 
      vials, a few THROWING STARS, NYC subway tokens. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>This emergency bag's got some neat<br/>stuff in it - 
      weapons, charms,<br/>advanced reading assignments.</center>
<p>Dawn holds up the book she was holding in scene 10. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Cool stuff, but we've seen it all<br/>before. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Not this, we haven't.</p></center>
<p>Anya reaches into the bag and pulls Out a wooden BOX with a metal lock 
      holding it shut. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>What's inside it? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Don't know. This box hasn't been<br/>opened 
      since...</p></center>
<p>Buffy grabs the ancient metal lock and RIPS it off its hinges. Flips 
      open the box. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Well, since now.</center>
<p>They all look inside. Xander and Dawn reach inside, pull out the 
      makings of a copper TURNTABLE, LAMP and, strangest of all, some 
      African-looking SHADOW PUPPETS. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Puppets.<br/>(clicks fingers)<br/>That's it! The First 
      hates puppets.<br/>Now, if we can just airlift Kermit,<br/>Fozzi and Miss 
      Piggy into town - the<br/>First'll be a-runnin'. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Those are Muppets. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Damn. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>And these things are Shadow Casters.<br/>(re: book)<br/>According 
      to this, you put them in<br/>motion, they tell you a story. It<br/>says you 
      can't just "watch." You<br/>have to "see." 
      <p>ANYA<br/>And what the hell does that mean? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>That's cryptic. I don't like it.<br/>Every time instructions 
      get cryptic,<br/>someone gets hurt.<br/>(beat)<br/>Usually me.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He starts to put the shadow puppets back in the box, Buffy stops him, 
      gently but firm. To Dawn: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>"You can't watch, you have to see."<br/>See what? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>That's where all my fancy translatin'<br/>skills break down, but 
      I think it's<br/>an Origin Myth. The story of the<br/>very first Slayer. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I saw her. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You saw the first Slayer? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The other night, in a dream. It's<br/>got to mean something. 
      Let's find<br/>out what.<br/>(to Xander)<br/>Time for a puppet show.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander holds up parts of a LANTERN. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>There's, uh, some assembly required.</center>
<p>
<div align="right">TIME CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>In the darkened room, the assembled old LANTERN is lit. Xander, Willow 
      and Dawn take PAINTINGS off the walls, leaving them blank. In the center 
      of the room sits a FIVE-SIDED TURNTABLE. Xander holds flat, 2-D "puppets" 
      which fit into the sides of the pentangular turntable, ready. 
      <p>Dawn struggles with her ancient text. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Okay, um, according to this, I think,<br/>you add on these 
      puppet guys one by<br/>one. They cast shadows, and the<br/>shadows tell the 
      story.</center>
<p>Beat. Everyone's ready. Buffy nods. Xander SPINS the turntable device. 
      LIGHT projects out of the lantern, the only source in the room, casting 
      everyone in eerie light. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>First, there is "the Earth."</center>
<p>Xander selects one of the "puppets" and places it on the turntable. The 
      shadow-image of HILLS and the CRESCENT MOON spin around the room, past the 
      walls. 
      <p>We hear the sound of DRUMS. Far away, faint and ghostly, but definitely 
      there. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>So far, so creepy. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Then there came the Demons.</p></center>
<p>Xander inserts the next "puppet," and the image of HILLS is "chased" 
      around the room by the crude image of a MONSTER. We hear the faint ghostly 
      sound of a ROAR. 
      <p>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>After demons, there came Men.
      <center></center>
<p>Another insert. And the image of three MEN with STAFFS appear behind 
      the Demon and the Hills. 
      <p>We hear the ghostly sound of CHANTING. Dawn has to raise her voice to 
      be heard: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>The Men found a Girl.</center>
<p>Xander adds a GIRL image to the spinning shadow show. 
      <p>And we hear the sound of a SCREAM. The turntable starts to spin 
      FASTER... 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>The Men took the Girl. To fight the<br/>Demon, um, 
      all Demons. They...<br/>(hesitates)<br/>They chained her to the 
      Earth.</center>
<p>Xander adds the last image - of CHAINS - connecting the Girl image to 
      the Earth. We hear the sound of CHAINS RATTLING added to the growing 
      cacophony. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>And then... and then... I can't 
      read<br/>this!</center>
<p>The group watches the images RACE across the walls - the sound growing. 
      And the images now TAKE ON A LIFE OF THEIR OWN. The Girl is wrapped in 
      chains. The Demon menaces the Men. The turntable spins FASTER... 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Something about... "Darkness." 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What about darkness? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(faster)<br/>It says you cannot be shown, you<br/>cannot just 
      watch but you must see -<br/>see for yourself but only if you're<br/>willing 
      to make the exchange. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>When'd you get so good at Sumerian? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(small, scared)<br/>It's not in Sumerian anymore.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>WHOOSH! The blending images go OUT OF CONTROL into one another when - 
      WHOOSH! - the turntable DISAPPEARS AND a PORTAL, the size and shape of a 
      regular DOOR, made of glowing, swirling LIGHT, rises up in its place. 
      <p>The light from the portal's a blinding glare. 
      <p>The group clusters together, bathed in the supernatural light, looking 
      into the portal, they all must raise their voices to be heard: 
      <p>We see the FEAR on Buffy's face as she slowly steps forward, looking 
      into the glowing light, approaching it... 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>But what's it mean? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Means I have to go in there. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No it doesn't! It doesn't say that!<br/>Where does it say 
      that? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You don't even know what you're<br/>exchanging! You 
      don't even know if<br/>you're ready! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's the point. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Buffy, we have no idea where you're<br/>going or how to get 
      you back! 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You can't go! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's closing. I've gotta go.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks terrified, but cannot take her eyes off the swirling light 
      within the portal which, indeed is CLOSING (shrinking in size from all 
      four sides, closing in). 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>How will we get you back? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Find a way!</p></center>
<p>And with that, Buffy DIVES straight into the portal. She disappears 
      into it. Gone. And the second she's gone - WHOOSH! The portal slams shut. 
      <p>The room is stunned into silence. Xander taps his foot on the carpet. 
      No trace of the portal whatsoever. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>She's gone.</center>
<p>They all look around. Nothing. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Huh. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>What was all that about an exchange?</p></center>
<p>Then, in an aftershocky FLASH of light and a BLAST of air which blows 
      them all back a step or two, a DEMON TELEPORTS into the center of the 
      living room. It's HUGE - and looks like it could kill them all on the 
      spot. Tusks. Drool. Muscles. Big Bad news. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Ah. This must be the exchange<br/>student.</center>
<p>And the Demon backhanded PUNCHES Xander - right out of frame, then 
      LUNGES at the rest of them, readying to tear them all apart. 
      <p>
<center>END OF ACT TWO</center></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></font></p></td></tr>

<p>The Demon responds by LASHING OUT, smashing Willow in the face with a 
      backhanded PUNCH. Willow smashes against the living room table. 
      <p>When three THROWING STARS get embedded in its back. The Demon WHIRLS to 
      find Principal Wood, his mother's bag beside him, reaching for weapons. 
      The Demon SMASHES a big meaty fist down on the Principal, sending him to 
      the floor. 
      <p>Kennedy barks orders to Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Weapons!</center>
<p>Dawn rips open the weapons chest, grabs ahold of an axe, tosses a sword 
      to Kennedy. The Demon ATTACKS. It's a one- sided fight, the Demon's too 
      fast, too strong for them. 
      <p>Dawn gets thrown left, Kennedy goes tumbling right. 
      <p>Spike rushes in, susses out the situation quick: 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Get her out of here. All of you,<br/>'less you want to be 
      all dead and<br/>useless. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Yeah - what are you gonna do? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>What I do best.</p></p></center>
<p>Spike just gives her a look. Then LAUNCHES himself at the Demon. 
      <p>Spike grabs the Demon by the head and BASHES it against the living room 
      wall. Again. It hurts. Spike actually looks like he's doing some damage 
      when the Demon, having had enough, simply PICKS HIM UP. 
      <p>And throws Spike THROUGH THE CEILING. With no one else to defeat, the 
      Demon pushes past Kennedy and is gone. 
      <p>Pause. Everyone checks in with everyone else, making sure they're okay. 

      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Are you injured? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Just hurt. Don't make a case out of<br/>it. How about you? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Think we'll live. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(looking up)<br/>Except maybe Spike. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Is getting thrown through the ceiling<br/>what he does best? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I'll go check on him. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>And we've got bigger problems.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>ANGLE ON: The door, ripped off its hinges. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Demon loose, no Slayer. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>We need Buffy. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You gotta get her back. Looks like<br/>it's spell-o-clock. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Which spell? You see how powerful<br/>that thing was? You expect 
      to get<br/>that portal re-opened without sending<br/>Willow off the deep 
      end? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Thanks for your support. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Well it's true. There's got to be<br/>some other way. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>There isn't. And Buffy knew it. I<br/>have to get her back. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>We don't even know where she went.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT. AFRICAN PLAIN - DAY 
      <p>We sweep across a vast expanse of DESERT. Completely isolated. The 
      middle of NOWHERE. Maybe a blackened cow skull or two tied to a rotting 
      post, marking territory. 
      <p>Slowly, the sands begin to swirl, shifting... then there is a sudden 
      FLASH OF LIGHT. 
      <p>And Buffy DIVES into frame, hits the sand, sliding face-first down a 
      dune - an ignominious landing (for the stunt woman) 
      <p>Buffy gets up to her feet. Standing, she takes a second to get her 
      bearings. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Well. Guess that worked.</center>
<p>She looks around. Nothing in every direction. But then, she hears the 
      sound of DRUMS. She looks far off in the distance, and sees a small 
      collection of PEOPLE, maybe one TENT, stand far in the distance. 
      <p>Buffy starts walking toward them. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (pre-lap)<br/>I can't do this.</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow looks around at the devastation. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I have no idea how to re-open your<br/>run-of-the-mill 
      time/space portal.<br/>Let alone the big kahuna.<br/>(beat)<br/>Dawnie, 
      what's the book say. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Not much. Once Buffy left...</p></center>
<p>Dawn holds up the book for all to see. Flips through the pages. Each 
      and every one of them are BLANK. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>It got a little tougher to read. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>It's okay.</p></p></center>
<p>She places a re-assuring hand on Willow's arm. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>We'll just start with what we know,<br/>take it 
      from there. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Great, so far we know jack about<br/>squat - let's go from 
      there. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>You got the magic. Use it. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I, I don't even know what kind of<br/>magic to use. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Why not just try all thirty-two<br/>flavors. Worst thing that 
      happens<br/>is, you go brunette. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That's not the worst that can happen. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>She's right. And you know, we have<br/>a choice. Risk Willow's 
      life and all<br/>of our lives to get Buffy back, or...<br/>leave her out 
      there. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>If we play it safe back here, Buffy<br/>could stay 
      lost. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>You missed her "everyone sucks but<br/>me" speech. If she's so 
      superior,<br/>let her find her own way back. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Anya. The First is already up and<br/>running. Every second 
      the Slayer's<br/>not here is an opportunity for it to<br/>show up and rip us 
      all to pieces. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Willow. How would you get Buffy back? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That's what I'm saying, I don't even<br/>know... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(interrupting)<br/>If another witch was gonna do it -<br/>where 
      would she start? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Uh... physics. Principles, basic<br/>laws. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(leading her)<br/>Such as... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Conservation of energies. You can't<br/>really create or 
      destroy anything.<br/>Just.. transfer. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Phht. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Are you helping? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>No - but at least I'm not galloping<br/>off in the wrong 
      direction. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Magicks work off physics. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Not without a catalyst. If you're<br/>talking about transferring 
      energies,<br/>you'll need some kind of conduit. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What, like a Kraken's Tooth? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(nodding)<br/>Skin of Draconus, ground-up Baltic<br/>Stones, 
      something. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Good. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Plus we need an exchange, like you<br/>said: I'm thinking a 
      Slayer for a<br/>Demon. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Right. If we want Buffy back, we<br/>have to find that 
      Demon, send him<br/>through. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>It matter if it's dead or alive? 
      <p>SPIKE (O.S.)<br/>I vote "dead."</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They turn to see Spike standing in the foyer. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Slayer's counting on you, Willow.<br/>Get cracking on the 
      portal, and don't<br/>be stingy with the mojo.<br/>(beat)<br/>Demon's mine. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Uh, hate to say it, "big bad," but<br/>you look like you can 
      barely stand.<br/>We're trained. And the only thing we<br/>know for sure 
      about this Demon is -<br/>it kicked your ass.</p></center>
<p>Spike heads for the door. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Where are you going?</center>
<p>Spike, unseen by the others, allows himself a small, nasty grin as he 
      heads out the door. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Just one thing I need.</center>
<p>He heads out. Principal Wood just watches him go. Willow turns back to 
      the group. We hear CHANTING and CUT TO: 
      <p>EXT. AFRICAN PLAIN - DAY 
      <p>Buffy approaches a group of THREE MEN. The men rock back and forth, 
      chanting. She walks toward them, entering their group. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hello?</center>
<p>They stop chanting. Look up. These are the SHADOW MEN. Very old, Black 
      men wearing COWLS. Buffy stands among them. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I'm Buffy.<br/>(beat)<br/>I'm the Slayer. 
      I'm...</center>
<p>The SHADOW MEN all speak in SWAHILI. In SUBTITLES. Buffy speaks 
      English. They communicate as if speaking one language. 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>We know who you are</i>. 
      <p>SHADOW MAN TWO<br/><i>And we know why you're here</i>. 
      <p>SHADOW MAN THREE<br/><i>We've been waiting</i>.</p></p></center>
<p>Beat. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Good. That's good then and I know<br/>we've got bigger 
      issues to deal with<br/>but how'd I understand a word you<br/>just 
      said?</center>
<p>They stand without answering. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I know, ancient Magicks, I just<br/>thought it 
      was neat.</center>
<p>The Shadow Men stand, walk around Buffy. She turns to keep eye contact 
      with them as they check her out. 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>We have been here since the<br/>beginning.</i>
<p>SHADOW MAN TWO<br/><i>Now, we are almost at the end.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>Okay, and the "neat" of it just left<br/>me. End of what? 
      <p>SHADOW MAN THREE<br/><i>You are the Hellmouth's last Guardian.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>Latest. You mean "latest" guardian. 
      <p>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>No.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>Look - I got a First to fight. You<br/>three have clearly had 
      some time on<br/>your hands. Tell me what I need to<br/>know. I came to 
      learn. 
      <p>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>We cannot give you knowledge. Only<br/>power.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>Okay, know what I think? I'm not<br/>really here at all. None 
      of this is<br/>actually happening, this is like a<br/>play, like a shadow 
      play, like a non-<br/>reality re-enactment hologrammy...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>WHACK! Buffy's theorizing gets cut short as one of the Shadow Men 
      raises a QUARTERSTAFF up behind her and sharply knocks her unconscious 
      with one blow. She crumples to the ground. 
      <p>Without another word, the Shadow Men lift DRAG Buffy away, resuming 
      their chant, toward a distant CAVE... 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (PRE-LAP)<br/>And this is gonna help us how?</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow leads Kennedy as they pour a small bag of brightly colored SAND 
      across the floor, forming a circle. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>The sand forms the circle, the circle<br/>acts as a 
      barrier, the barrier<br/>contains the portal.</center>
<p>They finish with the sand. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Now what? We hold hands and chant<br/>"kumbaya" or 
      something? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Maybe. Until we get the Magicks up<br/>and running, I'm kind 
      of working on<br/>my best guess here. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Maybe we should wait. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>For what? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Spike. See if he can bring back that<br/>Demon. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't think waiting's the best idea<br/>right now. Opening a 
      portal this<br/>size, could take days. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Better get started.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow takes a deep breath, scared. Kennedy takes her aside. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I think I might pee in my pants. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>You can do it.<br/>(beat)<br/>The Magicks, not the pants 
      thing.</p></center>
<p>Willow sits in the center of the circle, lotus position.

<p>Still nothing. Willow turns to Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Dawnie, you better put on some<br/>coffee, this could 
      take a...</center>
<p>And suddenly, WHOOSH! Dawn and Kennedy both get BLOWN BACK away from 
      Willow. 
      <p>CLOSE UP OF WILLOW'S EYES - The pupils go DARK. 
      <p>Willow BELLOWS in rage and pain. Dawn and Kennedy, smashed against the 
      wall, just watch as Willow's roaring GROWS. 
      <p>INT. CAVE - DAY 
      <p>Buffy sits slumped against a wall, head bowed, unconscious. Slowly she 
      lifts her head, looks around to see: 
      <p>Buffy's POV: The Shadow Men stand before her, impassive in their cowls, 
      just watching. 
      <p>Buffy stands. Walks toward them - then stops - realizing she is CHAINED 
      TO THE WALL. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What is this? 
      <p>SHADOW MAN TWO<br/><i>We are at the beginning.</i>
<p>SHADOW MAN THREE<br/><i>The source of your strength. The<br/>well of the 
      Slayer's power.</i>
<p>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>This is why we have brought you here.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>I thought I brought me here.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>The three men say nothing. Then, they POUND their staffs into the 
      ground, rhythmically, in unison, throughout the following. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Listen to me. I'm already the<br/>Slayer. 
      Bursting with power - don't<br/>need more thanks. You're wasting<br/>time! 
      I'm here to learn - I need to<br/>know how to fight The First. 
      <p>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>The first Slayer - did not talk 
      so<br/>much.</i></p></center>
<p>We see a fuller picture of this cave space. It is a RITUAL CHAMBER, its 
      floor painted with an ornate, swirling SYMBOL. 
      <p>The Shadow Men CHANT as one of them steps forward holding a small, 
      WOODEN BOX. He places it on the floor, in the center of the painted 
      symbol, and opens the box. All three Shadow Men step away, and stand like 
      guards, holding their staffs. 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN ONE (cont'd)<br/><i>Herein lies your truest 
      strength.</i>
<p>SHADOW MAN TWO<br/><i>The energy of the Demon. Its spirit.</i>

<p>BUFFY<br/>This is how you... 
      <p>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>...Created the Slayer? Yes.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>(softly)<br/>Bastards... 
      <p>SHADOW MAN<br/><i>This is how we did so then. How we<br/>will do so 
      now.</i></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>And slowly, a MIST begins to rise from the open box... 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN ONE (cont'd)<br/><i>This is how it must be.</i></center>
<p>The MIST keeps rising, growing fuller, taking shape... 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN THREE<br/><i>It must become one with you.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>I get a say in this and I'm saying<br/>no... 
      <p>SHADOW MAN TWO<br/><i>Merge, live, and grow inside you.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>No! 
      <p>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>This is how it was then. How it must<br/>be 
      now.</i>
<p>SHADOW MAN TWO<br/><i>This is all there is.</i></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They keep pounding their staffs. Buffy pulls at her chains. The MIST 
      begins to swirl, rise high above the floor, and almost like a sentient 
      creature sniffing out its prey, slowly circles the ritual chamber. 
      <p>Then "sees" Buffy. And STRIKES. ENERGIES STREAM inside her eyes, mouth, 
      nose - Buffy throws her head back and SCREAMS. 
      <p>And as her screams fill the chamber, the Shadow Men watch, impassive as 
      statues.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CAVE - DAY 
      <p>Continuous. Buffy VIOLENTLY SHAKES her head, sending the mist out of 
      her. She backs up a step and braces herself, standing alone in the center 
      of the Ritual Chamber as the DARK MIST rises, swirls about her, stalking 
      her. 
      <p>BUFFY keeps an eye on the mist as it circles round her, bracing 
      herself, trying to get in some kind of defensive position, but the chains, 
      rattling, hamper her movements. 
      <p>And just as she gets distracted by the chains, the Dark Mist STRIKES - 
      diving right at her, fanning out her clothes, blowing her hair wild, going 
      up her skirt... 
      <p>Buffy SCREAMS in agony and the Dark Mist disperses all around her. 
      Re-coagulates, and takes its form again, still stalking. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Make this stop. 
      <p>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>This is what you came for.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>You got the wrong Slayer. I'm not<br/>the first one. 
      <p>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>We know.</i>
<p>SHADOW MAN TWO<br/><i>She begged for us to stop.</i>
<p>SHADOW MAN THREE<br/><i>We did not then. We will not now.</i></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>The Dark Mist dives again. Buffy rolls out of its path, it SWOOPS by 
      her and rises for another run. Buffy rushes to the Shadow Men, but her 
      chains restrain her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>How many times I have to tell you?<br/>I'm already the 
      Slayer!</center>
<p>She keeps playing defense with the mist as she talks. 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>You came to us for help.</i></center>
<p>The Mist DIVES again. 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN ONE (cont'd)<br/><i>Do not fight this.</i>
<p>SHADOW MAN TWO<br/><i>We only want to help you.</i></p></center>
<p>Buffy BACKPEDALS as far and fast as she's able, but in the end the 
      chains restrain her - she's stopped - and the Dark Mist shoots INSIDE HER. 
      She SCREAMS in pain and we cut to: 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
      <p>We see a bunch of random belongings getting roughly thrown aside - 
      discarded. We see SPIKE rummage through a seemingly disconnected series of 
      ITEMS - shoes, food, torn blankets, garbage really. 
      <p>Until he stops. And GRINS. 
      <p>Spike rises, pulling one long black item from the wreckage of his past 
      life -- it is his COAT. 
      <p>Spike WHIPS it around his shoulders, turning as he does so, and slips 
      it on without a moment's hesitation. And in the same motion, he's on the 
      move. He STRIDES out of the basement, eyes gleaming with purpose. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike keeps moving down the hallway, almost GLIDING with the old 
      vampire grace and menace. When he passes Principal Wood, standing calmly 
      in one of the doorways, watching him go. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Where you going? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Got a job. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Nice coat.</p></p></center>
<p>Spike passes. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Where'd you get it? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>New York.</p></center>
<p>This is all exchanged without Spike's breaking stride. Spike exits 
      frame, heading out the school, leaving Principal Wood behind. And his eyes 
      narrow, watching Spike, knowing for sure that this is the man who killed 
      his mother. 
      <p>Principal Wood's face is near-expressionless, but we hear the howling 
      winds of a STORM rising and cut to: 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow sits in the center of the living room, her hair whipping about, 
      the eye in the center of the storm. 
      <p>
<center>
<table align="center" width="60%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="middle"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(Latin)<br/><i>Via, concursus, tempus,<br/>spatium, 
            audi me ut<br/>imperio...</i> </font></td>
<td align="middle"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(English)<br/>Avenue, convergence, time,<br/>space, 
            hear me as I<br/>command... </font></td></tr></tbody></table></center>
<p>She grits her teeth, unable to bear the strain, and looks through the 
      maelstrom to see Kennedy looking at her with all the belief in the world. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Screw it. Mighty forces, I suck at<br/>Latin, okay? But 
      that's not the<br/>issue! I am in charge here and I am<br/>telling you, open 
      this portal NOW! 
      <p>XANDER<br/>It's not happening, Will. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Give her time, she's getting it. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Or something's getting her. Will -<br/>thinking you better 
      back up a little. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No!</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow, feral, her eyes already dark, SHOOTS out both hands - one 
      pointing at Kennedy, the other at Anya - and streams of ENERGY come 
      sucking out of both of them, flowing, fast, into Willow, hair going BLACK 
      instantly. She opens her mouth and lets out a primal yell of power and 
      ecstasy. 
      <p>And - WHOOSH! - The DOOR OF LIGHT emanates from the floor up. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Aahh!</center>
<p>Anya and Kennedy both fall to their knees, drained, horrified. Xander 
      REACHES in through the light and YANKS Willow away. She cannot take her 
      eyes off the portal - her handiwork. 
      <p>Kennedy looks on, horrified. 
      <p>EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>CRACK! Spike in VAMP FACE comes STAGGERING back into frame, lip 
      bloodied. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Aw come on now, Nancy, you call<br/>yourself a Demon? 
      Thought you were<br/>up for a proper fight.</center>
<p>Crack! Spike gets hit again, this time so hard he goes off his feet and 
      lands in a row of GARBAGE CANS. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Now we're talking.</center>
<p>Spike gets to his feet. The Demon comes running forward, grabs Spike 
      hard around the rib cage and lifts him off his feet, crushing ribs. 
      <p>Spike GROWLS, tossing his head back in agony, then brings his head 
      CRASHING forward, head-butting the Demon. 
      <p>The Demon drops Spike. Spike laughs and, from his knees, punches the 
      Demon right in the nuts. The Demon BACKHANDS Spike hard. Spike rises to 
      his feet, gesturing with both hands, "give it to me." 
      <p>The Demon gives it to him. Punch after punch after punch. Spike just 
      takes the beating because there's nothing else he can do. 
      <p>The Demon prepares to deliver the death blow when Spike leaps off his 
      feet and one-two, kicks the Demon twice fast in the face. Now it's the 
      Demon's turn to stagger back. 
      <p>Spike LAUGHS - and the laugh turns into a long bellowing HOWL at the 
      moon. Feral Spike, bloody, battered, and having the time of his life, 
      RUSHES forward out of frame to continue the fight, fists raised and not 
      giving a damn about anything. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (pre-lap)<br/>I can't fight this.</center>
<p>INT. CAVE - DAY 
      <p>BUFFY backs into frame, looking feral herself, the Dark Mist off her 
      for the moment, but honing in. Buffy keeps moving back, pulling her chains 
      TAUT. 
      <p>The Shadow Men watch, saying nothing. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I know that now. But you guys?<br/>You're just... 
      men.</center>
<p>As she says this, she PULLS on her chains - ripping one from its metal 
      ring, holding it fast to the floor. Now she's got a weapon. She swings the 
      chain as she moves with greater freedom. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Just the men who did this. To her.<br/>Whoever 
      that girl was, before she was<br/>the Primitive. To me, if you 
      could.</center>
<p>The Mist DIVES for Buffy again. This time, like a matador, she 
      side-steps it with ease, and, swinging the chain, heads for the Shadow 
      Men. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>But you can't.</center>
<p>Buffy lets loose with the chain - it WHIPS around one of the Shadow 
      Men's ankles. Buffy YANKS it, pulling the Shadow Man crashing down to the 
      floor. 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>You don't understand. You need our<br/>power. 
      To reject us is to disrupt<br/>the Slayer line.</i>
<p>SHADOW MAN TWO<br/><i>You are making things worse.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>Good.</p></p></center>
<p>The Shadow Men lift their quarterstaves, spread out, and ATTACK Buffy. 
      That's okay, she's got the chain. And with her legs free, she's good with 
      the kicking. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You think I came all this way to get<br/>knocked 
      up by some demon dust? Think<br/>again, old guys.</center>
<p>They move in with their quarterstaves. BUFFY swings the chain out, 
      wraps it around one staff, pulls it back to her, catches it, and in the 
      same motion brings the quarterstaff WHIPPING back around her, knocking out 
      the Shadow Man coming up her back. 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>You are only destroying yourself.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>Please. I died more times than you<br/>can count.</p></center>
<p>WHACK! She takes out the second Shadow Man with a well- placed 
      quarterstaff blow. 
      <p>EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike (still in VAMP FACE) is held pinned against a BRICK WALL by the 
      bellowing, enraged Demon. The Demon has a giant hand on either side of 
      Spike's head, and he's twisting. 
      <p>Spike reaches out with his own hands and grabs the Demon's head. 
      Matches him, death-yell for death-yell. 
      <p>They struggle. Then, there's a loud, sickening SNAP. And the Demon 
      falls to the ground, dead. 
      <p>Spike slumps against the wall, exhausted, but does not fall. He reaches 
      into his old coat's pockets as if by habit and - happy surprise - finds a 
      cigarette. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Don't know your feelings, big guy,<br/>but to me, a tumble 
      like that...</center>
<p>He sticks it in his mouth. Fishes around until he gets a white-tip 
      match - and STRIKES it off the dead Demon's tusk. We tilt up to see (in a 
      CUT, NOT A MORPH) that he's back in HUMAN FACE. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>It's good for the soul.</center>
<p>And grinning with wicked satisfaction, Spike lights up, exhales a 
      luxurious plume of SMOKE. 
      <p>INT. CAVE - DAY 
      <p>Buffy continues her fight with the Shadow Men, and the tide has turned, 
      momentum in her favor. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I think you forgot one thing about<br/>power.</center>
<p>The Shadow Man, facing her, simply DROPS his quarterstaff and stands 
      before her, defeated but dignified. BUFFY takes her own staff and CRACKS 
      it across her knee. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I am the power. Disrupting things is<br/>what I 
      do.</center>
<p>Howling, the Mist DISPERSES. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>See? 
      <p>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/>(sadly)<br/><i>We offered you power. You came 
      for<br/>knowledge.</i>
<p>BUFFY<br/>So tell me something I don't know. 
      <p>SHADOW MAN ONE<br/><i>As you wish.</i></p></p></p></center>
<p>The Shadow Man smiles sadly and lifts a hand, as if asking permission. 
      Buffy, wary, lets him. He reaches forward... 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN ONE (cont'd)<br/><i>Now you will see. But without 
      the<br/>power, I wish to know...</i></center>
<p>He touches her head. 
      <p>
<center>SHADOW MAN ONE (cont'd)<br/><i>How will you save the world 
      now?</i></center>
<p>And the LIGHT of the portal erupts behind her. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - FOYER/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike, holding the carcass of the DEAD DEMON by the back of the neck, 
      wordlessly HAULS him forward. There is a FLASH. 
      <p>INT. CAVE - DAY 
      <p>Buffy lets the Shadow Man reach out and TOUCH the side of her head - 
      and she RECOILS just as there is a parallel FLASH. The SCREEN FLARES OUT 
      WHITE. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>The flared-out LIGHT subsides. Buffy stands in the center of the living 
      room. She looks around at Willow, Dawn, Anya, Xander. No one says a word. 
      Buffy looks spent. 
      <p>
<div align="right">DISSOLVE TO:</div>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow and Kennedy enter the hall together, linger outside the door. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>You okay? You've been kinda quiet<br/>since... 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>You sucked the life out of me? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah. Since that.<br/>(beat)<br/>It's important you know. What 
      I am.<br/>What I'm like when I'm... like that. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>I thought it would be, I dunno.<br/>Cool, 
      somehow.<br/>(beat)<br/>It just hurt. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm sorry. You were the most<br/>powerful person nearby. 
      That's how<br/>it works. It's how I work. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>I get that. You told me. I'll um<br/>...I'll see you in the 
      morning.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Kennedy heads down the hall, alone. Willow just watches, lets her go. 
      Then turns and heads into Buffy's room. 
      <p>INT. SUNMERS' HOUSE - BUFFY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>BUFFY lies up, awake, in bed alone. Willow enters, sits on the edge of 
      the bed. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>You okay? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Thanks for bringing me back. Again. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It's what I do.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy nods. Willow nods. Nothing left to say. It's weird. Willow gets 
      up to go. Buffy calls her back: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Will?</center>
<p>Willow turns back. Buffy takes a moment, then: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>How will I save the world now? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't know. Usual way I guess?</p></center>
<p>Buffy tries to smile for Willow's benefit, but it fades fast. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Not this time. Will: The men I met.<br/>The Shadow Men. 
      They showed me. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Showed you what? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That the Primitive was right. It<br/>isn't enough. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Why? Buffy. What did you see?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy tries to look away, but Willow will not let her. They lock eyes. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>What did they show you?</center>
<p>Buffy looks at Willow, and before she says a word we see: 
      <p>INT. GIANT CAVERN - NIGHT 
      <p>An UBERVAMP lifts its fanged, snarling face directly into camera and 
      ROARS. We PULL BACK, fast, through a SEA of UBERVAMPS. 
      <p>The triumphant HORDES. Writhing, pillaging, many holding crude weapons, 
      truncheons, shields. 
      <p>And we keep pulling back. Sunnydale, behind them, is in FLAMES. WAR. 
      Apocalypse. The end of the World. 
      <p>
<div align="right"><u>BLACKOUT</u>.</div>
