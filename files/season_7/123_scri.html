<div align="right">FADE IN:</div>EXT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT 
      <p>We see the (backdrop of the) city sprawling out beyond the rooftops. 
      Arm down, past a man sleeping on a roof, down, into an alley where we pick 
      up a GIRL of about fifteen. She is running for her life. 
      <p>We move with her through alleys, past doorways that are either shut or 
      being slammed shut as she approaches. She looks about her, wildly, keeps 
      moving. 
      <p>ANGLE: a robe, skimming the ground as her pursuer follows. Another 
      enters frame as well. 
      <p>She hits a dead end, turns. 
      <p>The two robed figures appear at the end of the alley. They have hoods, 
      and beneath the hoods, black cloth covers their faces as well. Ninja Monks 
      would be the best approximation. 
      <p>She's terrified as they start toward her, but not without resolve. She 
      jumps up on a pile of trash, starts climbing up a pipe as she kicks away 
      the trash. One of the robed men grabs for her ankle but she's too high, 
      she's near the top of the wall -- 
      <p>She crests it and another figure appears in frame, pushes her roughly 
      back as she screams -- 
      <p>She falls back and lands on the alley floor hard. She is immobilized 
      and terrified as one of the men holds her down, the other pulling out a 
      horrible, ornate dagger. 
      <p>Her eyes. The knife. 
      <p>It leaves frame, and comes back bloody. Again. Again. We see nothing, 
      but we hear it all. 
      <p>EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
      <p>A vampire's FACE pops up from the dirt (he's already got an arm out). 
      He's creepy, cadaverous and hungry. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>It's about power.</center>
<p><u>Whip</u> over to see Buffy squatting by the grave, camera at ground 
      level and moving slowly around her. She holds a stake. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Who's got it... who knows how to use <br/>it...</center>
<p>She tosses the stake (without looking) and we whip with it to the foot 
      of the grave, looking up (waist level frame) at DAWN, who catches it, eyes 
      mostly on the vamp. Nervous. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (O.S)<br/>So who's got the power, Dawn? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Well, I've got the stake... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The stake is not the power. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>But he's new... probably confused,<br/>doesn't know what he 
      wants...</p></p></p></center>
<p>The vamp has both arms out now, looks at Dawn, grinning, as he 
      struggles to pull himself up. 
      <p>
<center>VAMPIRE<br/>(to himself) <br/>Blood... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He seems to have some focus there... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(trying to work it...)<br/>Yeah, ok, but he doesn't know his 
      <br/>strength, he might not know all the <br/>fancy martial arts they 
      inevitably <br/>seem to pick up... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Who's got the power? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(grumpy)<br/>He does. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(going to her) <br/>Never forget that. Doesn't matter<br/>how 
      well prepped you are, how well<br/>armed you are, you're a little girl. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Woman. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're a little woman. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I'm taller than you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/><u>He's a vampire</u>. Okay? A demon.<br/>Preternaturally 
      strong, skilled, with <br/>power that no human can ever -- 
      <p>VAMPIRE (O.S.) <br/>Excuse me...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They look over at him. He's still only waist level out of the grave. 
      <p>
<center>VAMPIRE<br/>I think I'm stuck. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're stuck. 
      <p>VAMPIRE<br/>My foot's caught on a root or <br/>something. I don't even 
      know how I <br/>got down there... if you girls could <br/>just give me a 
      hand... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>So he's got the power. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Zip it.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy crosses to him as he continues -- 
      <p>
<center>VAMPIRE<br/>I really appreciate it... it's just<br/>so dark, and I 
      don't know what I'm <br/>doing here... Maybe if you just give <br/>me some 
      leverage I can work --</center>
<p>Buffy yanks him up by the back of his jacket with one hand, sets him on 
      his feet. 
      <p>
<center>VAMPIRE (cont'd)<br/>Whooh. Thanks. That was a help.<br/>(Grins 
      evilly)<br/>Unfortunately, it was also the last --</center>
<p>Buffy's hand clamps on his throat and the last words come out as a 
      Donald Duck rasp. 
      <p>
<center>VAMPIRE (cont'd)<br/>-- thing you'll ever do. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Listen up. I'm the Slayer, you don't <br/>wanna get into it 
      with me. You want<br/>blood, okay? So you can have hers. <br/>She's not the 
      Slayer. She's the one <br/>to go after. Not me. 
      <p>VAMPIRE<br/>(still in choke voice) <br/>I was thinking along those lines. 

      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay then.</p></p></p></center>
<p>She lets him go, steps back. The vampire takes a step forward and Dawn 
      readies herself, trying not to look scared. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Power. He's got it, he's gonna use<br/>it. You 
      don't have it --</center>
<p>He rushes Dawn -- and she rolls back on impact, going under him as he 
      rolls past her and into a tombstone, hard. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>So you use that! Perfect.</center>
<p>Flush with momentary success, Dawn scrambles for her dropped stake, 
      jumps at the vamp and stakes him. A little too much to the right. 
      <p>Angry, he backhands her and she goes flying back. Before she can 
      recover -- blood dotting her lip -- he's on her, she scrambles underneath 
      him to get him off -- Buffy is nowhere to be seen -- Dawn pulls up a 
      stake, the vamp recoils and hisses, but grabs her arm and twists it 'til 
      she drops it in pain -- 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Buffy!!</center>
<p>His face comes closer to her's, she can't fight him off, saliva 
      dripping from his fangs as he opens wide and covers her mouth with his 
      hand and pulls her head to one side, exposing neck -- 
      <p>And brings his head down. Her eyes go wide -- and Buffy pulls him off, 
      throws him back. He keeps his footing, comes at her -- and a couple of 
      quick, but fairly dazzling moves disable him. Buffy grabs a sword sticking 
      out of the ground (by a bag of weapons) and beheads him. He dusts. 
      Needless to say, she has hardly broken a sweat. 
      <p>Her attention is on Dawn, who is on the ground, hand to her neck, which 
      is bleeding slightly. Her look is slightly bewildered and accusatory. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>It's real. That's the only lesson, <br/>Dawn. It's always 
      real.</center>
<p>She holds her hand out, and Dawn takes it. Buffy helps her up. Buffy 
      looks at her neck 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Let me see... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Just a scrape. Anyway I had a plan <br/>the whole time. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Really. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Yeah, I planned to get killed, come<br/>back as a vampire and 
      <b>bite you</b>. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You wanted to be trained... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(as Yoda)<br/>"The Stake is not the power..." <br/>Thank you, 
      Master Prada. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Geez, one violent near-death <br/>experience and you're 
      suddenly all <br/>testy. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Just next time you're gonna -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You did pretty well. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(total turnaround) <br/>I did? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>'Cause with the rolling thing, I was<br/>using his strength, it 
      was very tai <br/>chi, plus I nearly got the heart --</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy gathers the weapons and they start to exit the graveyard over the 
      following. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>My first time out I missed the heart <br/>too. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>No way. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Just the once. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Well the next vampire I meet -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The next vampire you meet, you run <br/>away. I just wish that 
      was all we <br/>had to worry about. Vampires, <br/>demons... they're nothing 
      compared to <br/>what's coming. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I know. I just can't believe it's <br/>back. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Believe me, I thought I was long past<br/>it. I guess you never 
      are. Just a <br/>few more days 'til it starts -- and <br/>then we'll never 
      know what's coming <br/>next.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>

      <p>EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY 
      <p>A group of business people and families gathered for a ceremony in 
      front of a large building. We are focused on ROBIN WOOD, a well dressed 
      African American, maybe thirty, holding the scissors -- but we're tracking 
      back FAST to see the entire building -- 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>... of the brand new, state of the <br/>art...

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. ENGLAND - DAY 
      <p>No, really! Actual England. Not like that cheesy Istanbul. 
      <p>Rolling green hills and an arm down to find GILES making his way along 
      them. We arm further down to see WILLOW, sitting by a tree with her back 
      to him. 
      <p>She is intent on: 
      <p>ANGLE: A FLOWER 
      <p>Which she is causing to (CGI time-lapse) grow in front of her. 
      <p>Giles comes to Willow and her flower, which is finished. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>That doesn't belong there.</center>
<p>She doesn't look back at him. Just quietly agrees: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>No, it doesn't. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Passafloracoerulea, native to <br/>Paraguay, if my botany 
      serves.</p></center>
<p>He sits by her. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Is there anything you don't know<br/>everything about? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Synchronized swimming. Complete<br/>mystery to me. Other than 
      that, I<br/>know all.<br/>(examining the flower) <br/>Yes, Paraguayan. Where 
      did it come <br/>from? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Paraguay. 
      <p>GILES<br/>You brought it through the earth. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It's all connected. The root<br/>systems, the molecules, the 
      energy...<br/>everything's connected. 
      <p>GILES<br/>You sound like Ms. Harkness. 
      <p>WILLOW <br/>She's taught me a lot. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Then why aren't you at your lesson? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm sorry. 
      <p>GILES<br/>It's all right. She was just afraid <br/>you -- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Had gone evil? Yeah, I was gonna <br/>destroy the world, but 
      lunch made me <br/>sleepy.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She offers the jest meekly, not being glib. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>She didn't think that. She was <br/>just -- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Afraid. They all are. The Coven<br/>is... they're the most 
      amazing women <br/>I've ever met. If it wasn't for<br/>them, and you... But 
      there's this<br/>look they get, like I'm gonna turn<br/>them all into 
      bangers and mash or <br/>something. Which I'm not even <br/>sure what that 
      is. 
      <p>GILES<br/>They're cautious. I trust you can <br/>understand that. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't have that much power, I don't <br/>think. I was... 
      drained by what<br/>happened. 
      <p>GILES<br/>But everything's connected. You're<br/>connected to great 
      power, whether you <br/>feel it or not. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You should just take it from me.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She rises. He follows. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>You know we can't. This isn't a <br/>hobby, or an 
      addiction. It's inside <br/>you now, this magic. You're <br/>responsible for 
      it. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Will they always be afraid of me? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Maybe. Can you live with that? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I deserve a lot worse. 
      <p>GILES<br/>That's not an answer. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I killed people, Giles. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I've not forgotten. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>When you brought me here... I thought <br/>it was to kill me. 
      Or lock me in<br/>some mystical dungeon for all <br/>eternity, or with the 
      torture... <br/>instead, you go all Dumbledore on me, <br/>I'm learning 
      about magic, I'm all <br/>about energy and gaia and root <br/>systems. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Do you want to be punished? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(tearing up) <br/>I wanna be Willow. 
      <p>GILES<br/>You are. In the end, we are all who<br/>we are -- no matter now 
      much we may <br/>appear to have changed.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY 
      <p>In the bright morning. 
      <p>A car pulls up to the curb. Xander steps out, and he's changed a bit 
      himself. He's sharp dressed in a dark suit and tie in which he's at 
      perfect ease. He's holding a set of rolled-up blueprints. We track around 
      the car with him a bit, low angle, taking in his new image. 
      <p>(NOTE: this can be shot as a reverse somewhere else if we're not 
      heading Torrance way any time soon.) 
      <p>INT. FOYER/DINING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUING 
      <p>We're raking the dining room window as Buffy crosses to it, sees 
      Xander. She moves to the bottom of the stairs, calls up: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Dawn! Xander's here! 
      <p>DAWN (O.S.)<br/>In a minute! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're gonna be late! 
      <p>DAWN (O.S.)<br/>I'm comfortable with that... </p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy opens the door as Xander enters -- 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Morning -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>You gotta eat! I made cereal! 
      <p>DAWN (O.S.)<br/>Okay...</p></p></center>
<p>We move into the kitchen with Buf and Xander. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You're unconscionably spiffy. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Client meeting. How exactly do you <br/>'make' cereal? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You put the box near the milk. I saw <br/>it on the food 
      channel. You want <br/>anything?</p></p></center>
<p>She tosses a few dishes in the sink as they speak, generally tidies. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>I ate, I'm good. How are you? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>My sister's about to go to the same <br/>school that tried to 
      kill me for <br/>three years. I can't afford private <br/>school, I can't 
      change districts, and <br/>I can't begin to prepare her for what <br/>could 
      come out of there, so peachy <br/>with a side of keen, that would be me. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(holds up blueprints) <br/>Well, here's a little something 
      for<br/>what ails you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You got the rest of it? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Take a look.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They cross back into the dining room, Dawn passing on her way to the 
      kitchen as Xander rolls out the prints. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Check out Double-Oh-Xander. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Go talk with your mouth full. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(re: blueprints) <br/>I got two crews working 
      this<br/>diabolical yet lucrative new campus: <br/>finishing up the science 
      building <br/>here, and reinforcing the gym. No <br/>pentagrams, no secret 
      passageways...<br/>everything up to code and safe <br/>as houses. I've 
      looked through all <br/>the plans, I've been on site after 
      <br/>hours...</p></p></center>
<p>Dawn wanders in, eating cereal. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Nothing's creepy? Strange? From <br/>Beyond? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(mouth full) <br/>Murbee yr paranuhd. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Well there is one interesting detail.<br/>I managed to scare 
      up the plans for <br/>the OLD high school. You remember,<br/>the very center 
      of Sunnydale's own <br/>hellmouth -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It was under the library.</p></p></p></center>
<p>He holds the old plans to the window so light streams through them. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Right. So I lined up the plans, new <br/>and old 
      --</center>
<p>He covers the new with the old. We can see both, the sun working like a 
      lightbox. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>And on the exact spot where the <br/>library 
      was, we now have... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(looking)<br/>... the principal's office. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>So the principal is evil? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Or in a boatload of danger. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>The last two principals were eaten. <br/>Who'd even 
      <b>apply</b> for that gig? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I guess we'll see. Time to head out <br/>(to Dawn)<br/>Got your 
      books? Lunch? Stakes? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Check thrice. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(to Buf)<br/>Did you give her... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Saving it.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy produces a box, slides it across the table to Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>What is this? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Back to school gift.</p></center>
<p>Dawn starts to open it, her excitement tempered with suspicion -- 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>It's a weapon, isn't it? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yes it is.</p></center>
<p>Dawn opens the box -- 
      <p>EXT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY 
      <p>As Buffy and Dawn climb out of Xander's car. Buses have arrived, kids 
      stream in, some with parents. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I'm gonna take her to class. Have a <br/>look around. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Okay. I'll be on site here most of <br/>the day, so if you 
      have needs... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Thanks.</p></p></center>
<p>He drives off as Buffy and Dawn walk toward the front entrance. Buffy 
      sees a girl who looks like Trouble with a side of Goth walking by herself. 
      Creepy. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Now remember: if you see anything <br/>strange, 
      or, you know, dead... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I got it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Stay away from hyena people, lizardy-<br/>type athletes... if 
      you see anyone <br/>invisible --</p></p></center>
<p>Dawn stops. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Buffy. I think it's pretty safe to<br/>say I'm not gonna 
      see anyone that's <br/>invisible. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You could still drop out. Only nerds <br/>finish school. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I really don't think it's fair for <br/>you to try and scare me 
      on my first <br/>day of high school, because it is <b>so</b><br/>redundant. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>This place is evil. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD <br/>Tough to let'em go, huh?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy spins to see Principal Wood smiling at the two of them. Most 
      everybody else has made it inside by now. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh. Hi. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Robin Wood. I'm the new principal. </p></center>
<p>They shake hands. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Buffy Summers. This is Dawn. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Nice to meet you. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Hi. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(probing)<br/>So you're the principal. I expected <br/>you to be 
      more... aged. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD <br/>(smiling)<br/>You seem just a little bit young to 
      <br/>have such a grown up daughter. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No! Oh. No. Sister. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD <br/>Right. Of course. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You didn't really think... Is it my <br/>hair?<br/>(to Dawn) 
      <br/>Do I have mom hair? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I have actually heard of you, Ms. <br/>Summers. You 
      graduated from the old <br/>high school, am I right? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. How did you -- 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Well, I better get to work. Got to <br/>start 
      deadening young minds. It was <br/>nice to meet you.<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>You 
      have fun.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>The principal leaves. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Well that was suspicious. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You betchya. Bye. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Dawn -- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I know. You never see it coming, the<br/>stake is not the power, 
      To Serve Man <br/>is a cookbook. I love you. Go away.</p></p></p></center>
<p>She scampers off. Buffy takes a beat, looking at the school. Another 
      beat, and she enters. 
      <p>INT. SCHOOL HALLS - DAY 
      <p>Buffy enters, looking about her. The last few people are heading into 
      classes. Buffy walks along the unfamiliar space, toting the 
      all-too-familiar dread. 
      <p>She turns a corner, comes to a row of lockers. 
      <p>ANGLE: FROM THE OTHER END we see Buffy small, lockers growing in frame 
      as they approach foreground. Buffy looks about her for a bit in the 
      silence. 
      <p>Something FLIES into frame and SMASHES into a locker right in front of 
      camera, bounces off. 
      <p>Buffy jumps, spins to look -- it's a basketball, that bounces back to 
      where it came from. It's another hall -- and a pair of hands takes the 
      ball from the ground, pulls it out of sight. 
      <p>Buffy starts toward the unseen person. Turns the corner -- and catches 
      a glimpse of a big young THUG, who glares at her menacingly in passing as 
      he disappears around the next corner. 
      <p>Buffy continues to follow, rounds the corner -- and he's nowhere. 
      <p>She walks slowly on, passing the door that says: BASEMENT. NO STUDENT 
      ACCESS. 
      <p>INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
      <p>Dawn sits in the back. On one side of her is a nice-seeming, attractive 
      girl, who is already whispering to a friend. On the other side is a quiet, 
      nerdy guy, who's probably not gonna speak to anyone for the first four 
      months. 
      <p>Dawn just looks around, apprehensive, vaguely smiling at people. 
      <p>
<center>TEACHER<br/>Well, okay. I'm Mr. Lonegrin. Why <br/>don't we go 
      around the room and <br/>introduce ourselves. Let's start 
      <br/>with...</center>
<p>And he scans about the room, 
      <p>
<div align="right">SMASH CUT TO:</div>
<p>Dawn, standing, in the middle of hers: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>... and my sister is a vampire slayer,<br/>her best friend 
      is a witch who went <br/>bonkers and tried to destroy the <br/>world, um, I 
      actually used to be a <br/>little ball of energy until about two <br/>years 
      ago when some monks changed the <br/>past and made me Buffy's sister and 
      <br/>for some reason, a big klepto. My <br/>best friends are Leticia Jones, 
      who<br/>moved to San Diego because this town<br/>is evil, and a floppy eared 
      demon <br/>named Clem.</center>
<p>ANGLE: The students stare at her. Total silence. 
      <p>
<div align="right">SMASH CUT TO:</div>
<p>Dawn comes out of her reverie -- she has said none of this -- as we 
      hear a student saying: 
      <p>
<center>STUDENT<br/>... Die Hard, Spiderman, and the <br/>Matrix, I'm hoping 
      to try out for the <br/>swim team this year, I love to swim,<br/>and uh, I 
      hope I don't flunk.</center>
<p>Polite laughter. Dawn just nervously waits her turn. How is she ever 
      gonna survive this? 
      <p>
<center>TEACHER (O.S.)<br/>Okay How about you?</center>
<p>INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM DAY 
      <p>Buffy enters, her fur seriously up. She stops by the sink, looks in the 
      mirror. A long beat, and she touches her hair. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>It's not mom hair...</center>
<p>She notices something on the sink, goes to it... 
      <p>ANGLE: a small bone, tied to a twig and a feather. 
      <p>Buffy's hand reaches into frame, picks it up. We tilt up to see Buffy 
      in the mirror, looking at it -- and a DEAD GIRL leers at her from right 
      behind her shoulder. 
      <p>Blue/white, peeling, cadaverous, (cause she's a cadaver, one would 
      presume) with deep gashes in her forehead and cheek that are still red and 
      matted blood about her face. Her hair is greasy and lanky, her clothes 
      dirty and torn. But honestly, the worst part is the smile. 
      <p>
<center>DEAD GIRL<br/>You can't protect her...</center>
<p>Buffy looks up, gasps -- 
      <p>
<center>DEAD GIRL (cont'd)<br/>Couldn't protect me...</center>
<p>Buffy spins -- There's no one there. She looks back in the mirror. No 
      one there either. 
      <p>CLOSE ON: BUFFY as she tries to take this in, freaked out. Suddenly a 
      DEAD JANITOR is right in her face, grabbing her, roaring: 
      <p>
<center>DEAD JANITOR<br/><b>GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!</b></center>
<p>He roughly pushes her back -- 
      <p>And she looks up to see he's gone as well. Push in on her. 
      <p>NOW she's wigged. 
      <p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CAFE - DAY 
      <p>We see a couple -- woman singing, man playing guitar, singing a happy 
      love song. 
      <p>ANYA sits with HALLIE (Halfrek, but they're in civilian face, so let's 
      be casual.) They sip large coffee-type drinks. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>God, they're depressing. 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>Who are they kidding with that happy <br/>shiny crap? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Six weeks, tops, and she's calling on<br/>me for vengeance. 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>(sarcastically)<br/>Ooh, he'd better run for cover... 
      <p>ANYA<br/>What's that supposed to mean? 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>Sweetie, you know exactly what it means.<br/>(off her 
      look)<br/>You're not keeping your end up! 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Excuse me? 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>It's the talk of the Order. They're <br/>calling you Ms. 
      Soft-Serve. Tell me<br/>you don't know this. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I.. Who... 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>Listen, Anya, I know I've been a <br/>little competitive with 
      you, there <br/>was that thing during the Crimean <br/>War, we laugh about 
      it now, but the <br/>fact is I've actually always looked <br/>up to you. You 
      were the single most <br/>hard-core vengeance demon on the <br/>roster and 
      everybody knew it. A <br/>woman was wronged, you were on her <br/>like icky 
      on poo, granting a wish <br/>that was guaranteed to make her ex --<br/>and 
      her -- regret they'd ever heard <br/>of romance. Do I have to mention 
      <br/>Mrs. Czolgosz? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Good times... 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>You lost your powers -- it happens --<br/>and you fell for 
      this Xander guy. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>It was a glitch! A summer thing! <br/>I'm SO back in the 
      vengeance fold! 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>Yeah-huh. You're a terror. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I've been granting vengeance wishes <br/>like a frito bandito 
      and you know it. 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>No deaths, no eviscerations -- you're <br/>not goading women 
      into anything <br/>inventive and you're not delivering <br/>when it is! 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I don't even know -- 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>Waitress downtown wished her husband <br/>was a frog, you made 
      him French! 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Well that's a... he's smelly, and with <br/>the little 
      mustache... 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>Anya, if it was just me, I'd say, <br/>"fine, she's not about 
      the hard <br/>justice..." 
      <p>ANYA<br/>What do you mean, if it was just you? 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>D'hoffryn, the lower beings, they're <br/>all feeling the 
      heat... something's <br/>rising. Something older than the old <br/>ones and 
      everybody's tail is <br/>twitching. This is a bad time to be <br/>a good 
      guy. You haven't felt any of <br/>this? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I have, I just... I just need to sort <br/>things out. 
      <p>HALLIE<br/>You need to get your vengeance on, <br/>doodle-bug. Before 
      they come after <br/>you. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(bitterly)<br/>So, is this an intervention? <br/>Shouldn't 
      <b>all</b> my demon friends be <br/>here?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Halfrek looks away, coffee to her lips -- 
      <p>
<center>HALLIE<br/>Sweetie, they are.</center>
<p>INT. SCHOOL HALLS - DAY 
      <p>Buffy comes barrelling out of the bathroom, takes a moment to get her 
      bearing, then heads off to find Dawn's class. We STEADICAM down the halls 
      with her, urgency increasing -- 
      <p>INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
      <p>Dawn is a actually standing, giving her little intro. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>... history, and sociology, I love to <br/>dance, I like 
      music, I'm very into <br/>Britney Spears' early work, you know <br/>before 
      she sold out, so mostly her <br/>finger painting, macaroni art...</center>
<p>Students laugh -- Dawn is gaining confidence, even enjoying herself -- 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Very under-rated... Favorite <br/>activities 
      include not ever having to <br/>do this again...<br/>(more laughs)<br/>And, 
      what else? I'm fairly boring <br/>otherwise --</center>
<p>Buffy BURSTS into the classroom, out of breath, intense -- 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Dawn! 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We gotta go. It's not safe. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>But...</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy begins to take stock as she continues, deflating somewhat... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>We, I mean I saw... 
      <p>TEACHER<br/>Can I help you? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, I... just <br/>(to Dawn)<br/>I thought you were in danger 
      of, <br/>um... smoking, and let's not, kids, <br/>'cause it's not cool to... 
      I'll be <br/>around.</p></p></center>
<p>She exits sheepishly. Dawn's look mirrors her own as the class looks at 
      her, silent now. A beat... 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>I also have a sister.</center>
<p>EXT. SCIENCE BUILDING - DAY 
      <p>It's under construction. Xander is there, jacket and tie gone, sleeves 
      rolled up and a hard hat on. BUFFY approaches him. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(to a worker)<br/>Tell Ronnie to let the other guys 
      <br/>finish upstairs.<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>So, how's it looking? Does the place 
      <br/>pass inspection? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's great, if you're a zombie-ghost-<br/>thing. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(damn)<br/>So school's in session, huh? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Seems like old times. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>S' wonderful.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He walks her to a more secluded spot, pulling off his hat. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd) <br/>So, zombies or ghosts? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm not sure. They were in the <br/>mirror, they disappeared, 
      but they<br/>touched me. I think. Let's just <br/>start with "dead" and 
      "pissed". 
      <p>XANDER<br/>They were after you personally? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(nodding)<br/>Talked about protecting people. Told <br/>me to 
      leave. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>No damage, though. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I think I may have destroyed Dawn's <br/>social life in all of 
      thirty seconds,<br/>but apart from that, no. 
      <p>XANDER <br/>Ahh, being popular isn't that great, <br/>or so I've read in 
      books. Anything <br/>I can do? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't know. You could blow up the <br/>school again... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>That never gets old... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's not a coincidence, you know. <br/>The school being 
      rebuilt. It means <br/>something... more. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>As in what?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She has no answer. Looks off into the distance -- 
      <p>INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
      <p>As does Dawn. The teacher is talking at the front of the class, but we 
      hear nothing. Lost in thought -- probably about the untimely death of her 
      social life. 
      <p>The nerd next to her leans in -- 
      <p>
<center>NERD<br/>Can I borrow a pencil?</center>
<p>She starts a bit, pulls one from her pencil case. 
      <p>ANGLE: THE PENCIL 
      <p>As she hands it over, the hand receiving it is blue/white and peeling. 
      <p>We move up to the nerd's face -- he's another of the dead people that 
      Buffy saw. 
      <p>
<center>NERD (cont'd) <br/>Thanks a lot.</center>
<p>The odd croak of his voice causes Dawn to turn to him -- and before she 
      can gasp he SHOVES THE PENCIL IN HER EYE. 
      <p>She falls back out of her desk, screaming and holding her face. Kids 
      come out of their chairs, the teacher rushes forward -- 
      <p>Dawn calms down, pulls her hands away -- there's no blood. No pencil, 
      two working eyeballs... 
      <p>Dawn sees everyone staring at her, looks over at the nerd's desk. It's 
      empty. 
      <p>
<center>TEACHER<br/>Are you all right? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I'm sorry, I'm sorry... there <br/>was a... a bee flew at my 
      eye, I'm very <br/>allergic... 
      <p>TEACHER<br/>I think it's gone... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Can I... can I got to the bathroom? 
      <p>TEACHER<br/>Of course.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Dawn rises, looking at the desk... 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>What happened to the... never mind.</center>
<p>She exits, very shaken. The kids look at her like she's crazy, 
      including the boy who spoke before. 
      <p>
<center>STUDENT<br/>Guess it runs in the family.</center>
<p>INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - DAY 
      <p>Dawn enters, sweating. She goes right to a stall and sits, shaking, 
      trying to clear her mind. 
      <p>She is there a moment when she hears something. It takes a moment to 
      recognize it as low sobbing. 
      <p>Dawn becomes very still. Listens. The sound is coming from further down 
      in the stalls. Slowly, a little frightened, she bends down to see: 
      <p>ANGLE: DAWN'S POV 
      <p>Down all the stalls. No feet. 
      <p>But the sobbing continues. Dawn looks worried, but not totally freaked. 
      She moves slowly out of her stall. Starts down the row of stalls... 
      <p>INT. SCHOOL HALLS - DAY 
      <p>Buffy is coming back from seeing Xander. She turns a corner and bumps 
      into -- 
      <p>Principal Wood. Buffy almost takes the principal out, but sees who it 
      is in time. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Whoa. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Sorry. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Ms Summers. I didn't know you were<br/>still about. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, I was looking... 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I thought generally it was customary <br/>for a person 
      who has graduated to,<br/>um, go somewhere else. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(a little cold)<br/>It's a new campus. I just want to <br/>get 
      to know it. Make sure it's all<br/>right. For my sister.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - CONTINUING 
      <p>Dawn approaches the last stall. The soft sobbing continues. 
      <p>Dawn reaches the door, pushes it open. 
      <p>The creepy looking goth girl Buffy saw outside (KIT) is huddled on the 
      tank, feet on the seat. She is terrified, clutching her shoulder bag (it's 
      the small old army kind and yes, it'll come into play later). 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Hey, what's wrong... 
      <p>KIT<br/>There's someone... in here... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It's only me. 
      <p>KIT<br/>No. It's not.</p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SCHOOL HALLS - CONTINUING 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You know, I actually know a little <br/>more 
      about you than I let on before. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Isn't that interesting. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>It really is.</p></p></center>
<p>INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - CONTINUING 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Let's just get you out of here, okay? <br/>We're gonna be 
      all right. But maybe<br/>we could get some air.</center>
<p>Slowly, Kit lets Dawn help her out of the stall. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>I'm Dawn. 
      <p>KIT<br/>Kit. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Saw something pretty creepy, huh? 
      <p>KIT<br/>You won't believe me. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I kinda sorta think I will. Was <br/>there a pencil involved in 
      any --</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She stops, looking in the mirror. Fast pan to show that in the mirror, 
      they are surrounded by all three of our dead folk. 
      <p>ANGLE: The lights 
      <p>EXPLODE! A shower of sparks above the girls' heads leaves the bathroom 
      in darkness. Kit screams -- 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Come on!</center>
<p>She tries to pull Kit toward the door, but the girl is on the deep wig. 

      <p>ANGLE: THEIR FEET 
      <p>As Dawn tries to drag Kit to safety, three sets of dead HANDS SMASH 
      through the tiled floor and GRAB at them. 
      <p>A whole chunk of floor crumbles beneath the screaming girls as they are 
      pulled down into darkness.

      <p>As she gasps, like she's just come up from underwater. 
      <p>Widen to see Giles on his knees, holding her -- she has collapsed on 
      the front lawn of an old stone house. 
      <p>For a few moments she continues to gasp, panic etched in her sweating 
      face.

<p>A few more moments, and she shakily disengages herself, resting with 
      her hands in the grass, breath still coming slow. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>What happened? 
      <p>GILES<br/>What do you remember?</p></center>
<p>She looks around her, getting her bearings. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>We were talking. And I felt --</center>
<p>She jerks her hands away from the grass, remembering. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd) <br/>I felt the earth.</center>
<p>She looks at Giles. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>It's all connected, it is, only it's<br/>not all 
      good and pure and rootsy...<br/>there's deep, deep black, there's...<br/>I

<p>INT. BASEMENT OF SCHOOL - DAY 
      <p>Dawn and Kit lie amidst the rubble. Kit is shaking Dawn, who shakes her 
      head, blearily. 
      <p>
<center>KIT<br/>Hey, wake up... please wake up... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Oh, God.</p></center>
<p>She feels the back of her head, winces in pain. Kit is looking around, 
      afraid. 
      <p>Dawn looks up at the hole they came through. Looks at Kit. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd) <br/>Are you okay? 
      <p>KIT<br/>We have to leave. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You're not wrong.</p></p></center>
<p>They help each other up. Dawn's a little woozy, and Kit's limping 
      slightly, but they're good to go. 
      <p>But the basement appears to be something of a maze. They turn, looking 
      for the best way out... 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>There's gotta be a staircase... 
      Come<br/>on.</center>
<p>They move toward a corner. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>What did you see? When I found you <br/>in the 
      stall? 
      <p>KIT<br/>A girl. She said she died here. <br/>That everybody dies here and 
      we all <br/>would too. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>And here I was worried about not <br/>fitting in.</p></p></center>
<p>They're about to turn the corner when a large figure SHOOTS out right 
      in front of them -- they SCREAM -- 
      <p>It's the thug with the basketball that Buffy saw in the halls. He has 
      no ball now, just a look of terror. He's called: 
      <p>
<center>CARLOS<br/>Who are you? 
      <p>KIT<br/>Who are you? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Are you dead? 
      <p>CARLOS<br/>Stop saying that! 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Whoa, Whoa... we're not dead, we saw <br/>scary dead people, 
      we're trying to <br/>get out of here. 
      <p>CARLOS<br/>I just came down for a smoke, you <br/>know, and I saw... it 
      was the <br/>janitor, yelling at me, I thought he <br/>was just pissed, but 
      I saw him in the <br/>light... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You came downstairs. WHERE? 
      <p>CARLOS<br/>Man, I got no clue. I ran away like <br/>a girl, I don't know 
      this place at <br/>all. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Okay, so we can run around in <br/>circles, or -- 
      <p>DEAD JANITOR<br/>You really think you can run away?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He's several yards away, coming into the dim light. (Did I mention it's 
      really dark down here?) 
      <p>
<center>KIT<br/>It's not real... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(grimly remembering)<br/>Lesson one: It's <b>always</b> real. 
      <p>DEAD NERD<br/>I tried to run, too.</p></p></center>
<p>They whip -- he's coming from the other direction. 
      <p>
<center>DEAD GIRL<br/>I tried to <b>scream</b>.</center>
<p>They're surrounded. The dead people shamble toward them with menacing 
      glee. 
      <p>
<center>DEAD GIRL (cont'd) <br/>It doesn't matter how much you <br/>scream. 
      Nobody ever hears you.</center>
<p>Realizing, Dawn starts going through her pockets. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Hear me, right... I got a present...<br/>my sister gave me 
      a present. 
      <p>KIT<br/>What is it?</p></center>
<p>Dawn pulls out a small <b>cell phone.</b>
<p>
<center>DAWN<br/>A weapon.</center>
<p>INT. SCHOOL HALLS - CONTINUING 
      <p>Buffy still speaks with the Principal. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>The school board recommended I spend <br/>some 
      time reading your record. It's <br/>a page turner. Kind of a checkered 
      <br/>past. 
      <p>BUFFY <br/>More like plaid. Kind of a Clan <br/>Tartan of badness, 
      really, but there <br/>were factors. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Well, your sister clearly looks up to<br/>you -- 
      <p>BUFFY <br/>Oh, she's much, much worse than me. <br/>She's a 
      trouble-maker. Expulsion is <br/>really the way to go there, or 
      maybe<br/>just suspend her for... three years... 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD <br/>(smiles)<br/>Well, we'll give her a chance, 
      first.<br/>As long as she --</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy's phone rings. She jumps a little. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hey! That's loud. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>That's part of why we don't allow --</p></center>
<p>But Buffy has it to her ear -- 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>'Scuse me.<br/>(listens)<br/>Uh huh?<br/>(to 
      Wood)<br/>Sorry.<br/>(bad liar time:) <br/>It's my dog. My dog 
      walker.<br/>(into phone) <br/>Three dead? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD <br/>Oh my god. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(into phone)<br/>...Yeah... 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Your dogs are dead? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'll be right there.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. BASEMENT OF SCHOOL - CONTINUING 
      <p>Dawn is on the phone as the three kids back into a corner. Dawn is 
      scared, but together. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Good. And, Buffy...</center>
<p>INT. SCHOOL HALLS - CONTINUING 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Yeah?</center>
<p>INT. BASEMENT OF SCHOOL - CONTINUING 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Isn't this reception amazing? I'm in <br/>the frikkin' 
      basement!</center>
<p>A moment, and she hangs up. Looks to the other two. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Help is on the way, guys, we just <br/>gotta 
      --</center>
<p>ANGLE: The dead guys are gone. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Where did they --</center>
<p>And the Janitor's hand SHOOTS around her throat. 
      <p>INT. SCHOOL HALLS - CONTINUING 
      <p>Buffy is pocketing her phone, backing away. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY <br/>I'm sorry, but I have to go. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Of course... good luck with your... <br/>dog 
      tragedy... </p></center>
<p>Buffy turns the corner -- then, out of sight, bolts. 
      <p>INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
      <p>Buffy enters. It's still dark, and there's still a big hole in the 
      floor. Without hesitation, Buffy jumps cleanly down through the hole -- 
      <p>INT. BASEMENT OF SCHOOL - CONTINUING 
      <p>And lands, catlike (but not Tom Cruise in MI2-like, 'cause LAME), 
      looking around. 
      <p>She's alone. 
      <p>Looks around a bit. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Dawn!</center>
<p>No sound, no movement. Buffy starts through the dark space -- it really 
      does resemble a maze. 
      <p>A moment, then she remembers -- pulls out the phone, speed dials. Waits 
      -- hears a distant ringing, far left. She runs down the corridor towards 
      it, but it stops. She puts the phone to her ear -- 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Dawn! I'm close by -- 
      <p>DEAD JANITOR (ON PHONE)<br/>You're too late.</p></center>
<p>Buffy's face tightens. She slows, still heading in the same direction. 
      <p>
<center>DEAD JANITOR (cont'd; ON PHONE) <br/>But then, you're always too 
      late, <br/>aren't you?</center>
<p>Buffy rounds the corner -- and there he is, smiling at her. No phone, 
      though. 
      <p>
<center>DEAD JANITOR<br/>Sure as hell didn't save <b>me</b>... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Where's my sister? 
      <p>DEAD JANITOR <br/>I think she's lost...</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks around, sussing the space. Some doors, halls going off -- 
      no clue if Dawnie might be around. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>If I'm the one that let you die, why <br/>take it out on 
      her? I'm right <br/>here... What are you after? Fear? <br/>Revenge? Tasty 
      brains? 
      <p>DEAD NERD<br/>I think I'd like Dawn to be my <br/>girlfriend...</p></center>
<p>He's appeared to the left of her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Again, wrong sister. I'm the one <br/>that dates dead 
      guys. And no <br/>offense, but they were hotties. I <br/>mean, I'm sure you 
      had a great <br/>personality...</center>
<p>She's on the other side, gradually they gather before her. 
      <p>
<center>DEAD GIRL<br/>Were you busy making out with your <br/>dead boyfriend 
      when I was ripped to <br/>death by a werewolf? Is that why you <br/>let me 
      die? 
      <p>DEAD NERD<br/>I was screaming for help when they <br/>pulled me down into 
      the -- 
      <p>BUFFY <br/>Hello...<br/>(calls time out)<br/>Not making myself clear: I 
      don't care<br/>how you died. I'm sorry for your <br/>loss, now stay out of 
      my way. <b>DAWN!</b>
<p>DEAD JANITOR<br/>She's not gonna hear you. Place is<br/>like a maze, it 
      just swallows up <br/>sound.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks around her, increasingly worried. 
      <p>
<center>DEAD JANITOR (cont'd)<br/>A person could spend months in 
      here<br/>and never be found. Believe me, I<br/>know. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What do you want? 
      <p>DEAD JANITOR<br/>You don't belong here. 
      <p>DEAD GIRL<br/>This place is ours, now. It's built <br/>on our graves. We 
      rested easy until <br/>we felt you return. 
      <p>DEAD JANITOR<br/>Leave. Leave and never come back. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'd love to. Really. But -- 
      <p>DEAD JANITOR<br/>Dawn is fine. She's sitting in class <br/>right now, not 
      remembering any of <br/>this. We don't care about her. All <br/>we want is 
      for you to leave so we can <br/>rest again. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Actually, I think all you want is to <br/>get between me and 
      that door.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She indicates a rusty metal door behind them. It's so like the wall it 
      sits in that it's almost invisible. The Dead Guys look pissed that she 
      sussed that one. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Who's for finding out why?</center>
<p>It's probably a bad idea for the nerd to rush her first -- she grabs 
      his arm and single handedly (in the literal sense) swings him into the 
      wall behind her, swinging him back into the Janitor, who follows hard 
      upon. They both go flying and Buffy heads for the door and the girl JUMPS 
      on her, screaming, trying to bite her -- Buffy jumps up and back, flies 
      through the air and lands as hard as she can on the girl, wrestler-style. 
      Rolls away and comes up and all three are suddenly standing between her 
      and the door as though nothing has happened. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>It at first you don't succeed...</center>
<p>She runs at them -- they charge -- and she jumps over them, flipping in 
      mid air (high ceilings), landing on her feet and dashing for the door - 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>-- cheat.</center>
<p>She pulls -- it's locked -- suddenly they grab her, pull her back, some 
      panic on their faces -- she elbows, shakes and kicks them off, pulls at 
      the door again, we hear metal groaning, locks snapping -- and the door 
      flies open. 
      <p>
<center>Buffy (cont'd)<br/>Dawnie! We have to get --</center>
<p><b>SPIKE.</b>
<p>Standing two inches from her face. Hair disheveled, longer, with roots 
      showing. Clothes dirty and torn. On his face, madness and despair. And 
      possibly violence. 
      <p>Buffy stops.

      MOMENT LATER 
      <p>Buffy and Spike stare at each other, neither particularly 
      comprehending. The dead types not a factor as we stay in close ups... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike...?</center>
<p>He says nothing. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Are you... real?</center>
<p>He laughs at that and his laughter is so close to tears it's not 
      pretty.

<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Spike...</center>
<p>He reaches out to touch her face. She's kind of immobilized... 
      <p>SPIKE
      <center>Buffy... duck...<br/>
<p>BUFFY<br/>What? What duck? There's a duck?</p></center>
<p>The Janitor SLAMS her in the back of the head with a baseball bat-sized 
      pipe. She goes face first into the wall, drops to the ground in agony, 
      blood coming from her nose. 
      <p>Spike just takes a step back into the darkness of his inner chamber, 
      muttering... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>No visitors today... terribly busy...</center>
<p>The Janitor swings the pipe down again, Buffy blocks it with her arm, 
      but that nearly breaks bone. She cries out in pain. 
      <p>ANGLE: NERD and GIRL 
      <p>Watch with satisfaction. 
      <p>
<center>NERD<br/>Told you to get out...</center>
<p>Buffy leg sweeps the Janitor, sends him to the ground. She grabs the 
      door and jerks it into his face three times in rapid succession. 
      <p>She pulls herself painfully into the inner chamber, Spike backing 
      further away. Shuts the door behind her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>They'll probably show up in a sec -- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Nobody comes in here. It's just the <br/>three of us.

      <p>SPIKE<br/>DON'T YOU THINK I'M TRYING?!? Ooh, <br/>not a fast, not a quick 
      STUDY... I <br/>dropped my board in the water and the <br/>chalk all ran, 
      sure to be caned...<br/>(laughs weakly)<br/>...should've seen that 
      coming...</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy comes to him, focused on him now... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike... what happened...</center>
<p>He moves a step away, pulling his unbuttoned shirt closed. Concerned, 
      Buffy comes to him and gently opens his shirt.

      around. 
      <p>INT. BASEMENT CHAMBER BY FURNACE - CONTINUING 
      <p>Dawn pulls the bag strap as long as it will go. She hefts the bag -- 
      it's heavy. 
      <p>
<center>KIT<br/>Do you think they'll come back? 
      <p>DEAD GIRL<br/>(vicious mimic)<br/>Do you think they'll come 
back?</p></center>
<p>She steps into the dim light of the furnace, the others behind. The 
      nerd now holds the pipe. 
      <p>
<center>DEAD GIRL (cont'd) <br/>We never left. We'll always be here, 
      <br/>just like you. 
      <p>KIT<br/>No... 
      <p>DEAD GIRL<br/>Why do you think we picked you? The <br/>ones no one will 
      miss... the ones <br/>that don't belong... Spend all your <br/>time trying 
      to get out of high <br/>school, and now you'll never ever 
      <br/>leave.</p></p></center>
<p>With a roar, Dawn SWINGS the bag at her -- but it's too heavy and she 
      only hits her in the shins. But that works too, the girl stumbling back 
      and clutching her shins as the Janitor punches Dawn and knocks her to the 
      ground. Kit SCREAMS -- 
      <p>INT. BASEMENT OF SCHOOL - CONTINUING 
      <p>Buffy hears the struggle, makes for it. 
      <p>INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - CONTINUING 
      <p>Xander bursts in, stops short at the damage. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER <br/>Whoa! Contracty goodness. <br/>(back to business) 
      <br/>Talisman. Talisman.</center>
<p>He starts looking, but it's dark in here. 
      <p>INT. BASEMENT CHAMBER BY FURNACE - CONTINUING 
      <p>The Janitor kneels down, pulls Dawn's head up by the hair. 
      <p>
<center>DEAD JANITOR<br/>You can thank your sister for this.</center>
<p>Buffy bursts through the door -- Nerd swings, but she ducks, rolls 
      forward onto her back from which position she slams her legs into the 
      kneeling Janitor, sends him flying against the wall -- 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Thanks, sis. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We just gotta hold 'em at bay --</p></center>
<p>And the nerd slams the big pipe down, Buffy barely rolling out of the 
      way this time. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>The bag!</center>
<p>Buffy grabs the strap as she gets up, swinging the bag with ease very 
      different from Dawn's -- in fact she picks up speed, swinging it like a 
      bolo -- and it's bag-fu time as she, Chan-like, swings it into zombie 
      faces, over her head, around her back -- around the pipe, pulling it away 
      from the nerd while headkicking the girl back into the dark corner -- and 
      never stopping the graceful motion of her deadly swinging brickbag 
      <p>INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - CONTINUING 
      <p>Xander is on his hands and knees by the sink, careful to avoid the 
      hole... 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Come on.... yes!</center>
<p>He picks up the twig/bone/feather thing -- 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd) <br/>Talisman!</center>
<p>He stands -- and Dead Girl is right by him, screaming and attacking. 
      <p>INT. BASEMENT CHAMBER BY FURNACE - CONTINUING 
      <p>Buffy finally lets the bag go, flying into Janitor face and sending him 
      rocketing back. 
      <p>Without thought, Dawn tosses Buffy the big pipe and Buffy catches it 
      without looking, twirls it into a ready stance. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You really wanna keep this up? 
      <p>DEAD JANITOR<br/>What are you gonna do? Kill us?</p></center>
<p>INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - CONTINUING 
      <p>Xander is on his back in the corner. He manages to keep the clawing 
      girl away long enough to snap the bone and rip the thing apart. 
      <p>She disappears. 
      <p>INT. BASEMENT CHAMBER BY FURNACE - CONTINUING 
      <p>As do Nerd and Janitor. 
      <p>A beat, as everyone lets the air out. 
      <p>
<center>CARLOS<br/>Are they gone? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. Talisman must've been <br/>Destroyed. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>How'd you know it was a talisman?</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks over at the doorway, thinking about Spike. Turns to Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>There's always a talisman.</center>
<p>She tosses the pipe to the ground. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>The real question is who put it there. </center>
<p>She looks at the freaked-out kids. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) <br/>Let's find a way upstairs. Assuming <br/>there 
      is one.</center>
<p>As they go: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>You really weren't kidding about this <br/>place. I guess 
      it hasn't changed. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't know... it seems smaller.</p></center>
<p>INT. SCHOOL HALLS - DAY 
      <p>Pan through the halls as kids change classes, packing the place. 
      <p>Buffy, Dawn, Carlos and Kit are all together near the entrance to the 
      basement. It's crowded, but these four are in their own world. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You guys are gonna be okay. This<br/>school is intense, 
      but you can do all <br/>right if you're careful. And you <br/>might wanna 
      think about sticking <br/>together. 
      <p>KIT<br/>Thank you...</p></center>
<p>She hugs Buffy. Carlos puts his arm on her shoulder and says, 
      sincerely: 
      <p>
<center>CARLOS<br/>Yeah. I mean it. You're the coolest <br/>mom 
      ever.</center>
<p>Ashen, Buffy instinctively touches her hair. Dawn smiles. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Come on. We've still got a few more <br/>classes to live 
      through.</center>
<p>She kisses Buffy on the cheek and then takes off, arm in arm with Kit, 
      Carlos staying close. Buffy watches them go, then turns to find Principal 
      Wood staring at her. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Curiouser and curiouser. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What is? You is? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Carlos Trejo and Kit Holbern. <br/>Possibly the only 
      two students in <br/>this school who's files are as thick <br/>as yours was. 

      <p>BUFFY<br/>You really did do your homework. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I was looking for one or both of them <br/>to implode 
      in a fearsome way before<br/>midterms, and you've got 'em <br/>socializing, 
      hugging, and if I'm not <br/>mistaken, actually headed to class. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, we shared an... encounter. <br/>Sometimes you just gotta 
      break the <br/>ice. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You were probably more than happy to <br/>get out of 
      this place, but I gotta <br/>tell you, Ms. Summers, I think you <br/>belong 
      here. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hamnoo? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Ever think about coming back? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Is this that nightmare where I didn't <br/>take finals? Should 
      I be in my <br/>jammies? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I know this school's reputation. You <br/>think I got 
      this job 'cause I had <br/>seniority? We've got a lot of pretty<br/>troubled 
      students here, and just <br/>enough money to keep the place from <br/>caving 
      in. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You may need a little extra there. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>We do have a small community outreach <br/>program, 
      gets people from the town to <br/>teach electives and such... the money 
      <br/>we could pay you wouldn't even fold, <br/>but it would just be a couple 
      days a <br/>week... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You want me to be a counselor? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD <br/>We have a guidance counselor, but I<br/>think the 
      kids could use someone, you <br/>know, closer to their age, who <br/>still 
      -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm in. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You serious? You heard the part <br/>about the money? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I heard. I've been temping, my <br/>schedule could be a little 
      funtastic, <br/>but I'll work it out. I'd like to <br/>keep an eye on this 
      place. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD <br/>Well that's great. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Just let me know. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD <br/>All right. <br/>(looks at watch)<br/>It's not even 
      noon and I've already<br/>bullied my first family member into <br/>helping 
      out. I'm going to be the <br/>best principal ever.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>The principal smiles, winningly, and goes off. Buffy watches, her smile 
      fading. Still not sure about this person. She looks around the building a 
      bit, then exits out the front. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (O.S.)<br/>I've got so much to learn.</center>
<p>EXT. ENGLAND - DAY 
      <p>Willow sits with Giles. It is not long after her attack, and they have 
      been talking. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>You always will have. That doesn't<br/>ever stop. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>There's so much I don't understand <br/>yet. About control, 
      and, and potions <br/>I'm not good with. Plus, many <br/>concepts I appeared 
      to understand, I<br/>was only nodding and hmmmming in a <br/>pretend fashion 
      so as to not look <br/>dumb. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Willow, I understand you're not ready <br/>to go back. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Then why are you gonna ask me to?</p></p></p></center>
<p>He doesn't answer. A beat. 
      <p>INT. BASEMENT OF SCHOOL/INNER CHAMBER - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike is rocking on his haunches, muttering to himself. We PUSH IN... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Everything is... I had a speech, I<br/>learned it all... 
      oh God, she won't<br/>understand... she won't understand...</center>
<p>And suddenly we see a pair of legs pass him, and tilt up to see WARREN 
      pacing around the room. 
      <p>
<center>WARREN<br/>Of course she won't understand,<br/>Sparky. I'm beyond 
      her <br/>understanding. She's a girl. Sugar <br/>and spice and everything 
      <b>useless</b><br/>unless you're baking. I'm more than <br/>that. More than 
      flesh --</center>
<p>He MORPHS into GLORY... 
      <p>
<center>GLORY<br/>-- More than blood, I'm... you know, <br/>I honestly don't 
      think there's a <br/>human word fabulous enough for me. <br/>Oh, my name 
      will be on everyone's <br/>lips -- assuming their lips haven't <br/>been 
      torn off -- but not just yet. <br/>That's all right, though...</center>
<p>And MORPHS into ADAM... 
      <p>
<center>ADAM<br/>...I can be patient. Everything is <br/>well within 
      parameters. She's right <br/>where I want her. And so are you, <br/>number 
      17. You're where you belong.</center>
<p>... into MAYOR WILKINS, who squats opposite Spike. 
      <p>
<center>MAYOR WILKINS<br/>What'd you think, you'd get your soul <br/>back 
      and everything would be Jim <br/>Dandy? A soul's slipperier than a 
      <br/>greased weasel -- why do you think I <br/>sold mine? Well, you probably 
      <br/>thought you'd be your own man and I <br/>respect that. But you never 
      will.</center>
<p>He reaches for Spike's face, MORPHING into DRUSILLA. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILIA<br/>You'll always be mine. You'll always <br/>be in the 
      dark with me, singing our <br/>little songs. You like our little <br/>songs, 
      don't you?</center>
<p>He lets her caress his face, still trying to shut them all out, still 
      muttering inaudibly. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA (cont'd)<br/>You always liked them, right from the 
      <br/>beginning. And that's where we're <br/>going.</center>
<p>She stands, MORPHS into THE MASTER. 
      <p>
<center>THE MASTER<br/>Right back to the beginning. Not the <br/>"Bang", not 
      the "Word", the true <br/>beginning. <br/>The next few months are going to 
      be <br/>quite a ride, and I think we're all <br/>gonna learn something about 
      ourselves <br/>in the process. You'll learn you're<br/>a pathetic shmuck, if 
      it hasn't sunk<br/>in already.</center>
<p>He stands over Spike's hunched figure. 
      <p>
<center>THE MASTER (cont'd) <br/>Look at you. Tried to do what's <br/>right. 
      Just like her, you still <br/>don't get it. It's not about right. <br/>It's 
      not about wrong.</center>
<p>And he MORPHS as well, Spike looking up to see the face towering above 
      him, looking down at him with a quiet smile... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>It's about power. </center>
