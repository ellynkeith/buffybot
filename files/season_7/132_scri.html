<div align="right">FADE IN:</div>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>The living room still shows a ton of evidence of the attack of The 
      Bringers. However, the place has been righted enough that the gang can get 
      down to research. It's clear that the night has been spent working hard 
      and people are anxious and tired... 
      <p>ANYA is on the couch, surrounded by mystical texts. DAWN has cleared a 
      place for herself on the floor. WILLOW is at the table on the computer, 
      BUFFY sits across from her. ANDREW, who fainted in the big fight at the 
      end of Nine, is still out. He's tied up to a chair in a corner. XANDER 
      sweeps glass and debris up from the floor, contemplates the busted windows 
      everywhere... 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>It's a loop. Like the mummy hand.<br/>I'm doomed to 
      replace these windows<br/>for all eternity.<br/>(then)<br/>Maybe we should 
      just board these up<br/>until things are less Hell-mouthy.</center>
<p>Anya throws a book down, frustrated. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Nothing.<br/>(re: other books)<br/>And nothing. And the 
      Cliff Notes to<br/>nothing. Nothing abridged... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah, my searches aren't turning<br/>anything up 
      either.<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Are you sure this thing called itself<br/>The 
      First? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Pretty sure. It claimed to be the<br/>original evil, the one 
      that came<br/>before everything else- 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Please. How many times did I hear<br/>that line in my demon 
      days. "I'm so<br/>rotten they don't even have a name<br/>for it... I'm baddy 
      bad bad bad.<br/>Does it make you horny?"<br/>(off their looks)<br/>Or 
      terrified. Whatever. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It wasn't a line. When I came up<br/>against this thing 
      before... I felt<br/>it. It was ancient and... enormous.<br/>It nearly got 
      Angel to kill himself.<br/>(grim)<br/>And if we don't rescue Spike 
      soon,<br/>who knows what else The First will<br/>get him to do. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(re: Andrew)<br/>I wish Sleeping Ugly would come to.<br/>He's 
      been out all night. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Yes, he was just starting to squeal<br/>when the spooky swat 
      attacked. Said<br/>The First was holed up at the Seal of<br/>Dan... Zal... 
      Something.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Dawn gets up, moves to Andrew. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Maybe he's just faking so he doesn't<br/>have to answer any 
      more questions.</center>
<p>Dawn SLAPS Andrew. Hard. Nothing happens. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>(simply)<br/>Or maybe he's in a fugue 
      state.</center>
<p>She reaches back to hit him again, but Buffy stops her with- 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Dawn- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What?</p></center>
<p>Buffy looks tired, stressed. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Just - he'll come to when he comes<br/>to... Keep reading, 
      okay? If we<br/>want to help Spike, we need to know<br/>how to fight this 
      thing.</center>
<p>Dawn goes back to her place on the floor, disgruntled. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(mutters)<br/>Anya gets to hit him. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(excited)<br/>Here's something!</p></center>
<p>Buffy and the others look up. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>The First-<br/>(not so excited)<br/>Bank of 
      Delaware.<br/>(then)<br/>Sorry.</center>
<p>CLOSE ON BUFFY 
      <p>Who looks disappointed, tosses the book she's holding into a discard 
      pile. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hand me the Watcher's Codex again?</center>
<p>A WOMAN'S HAND COMES INTO FRAME WITH A BOOK. Buffy takes it. Not really 
      paying attention. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE (O.C.)<br/>Can I get you anything else, honey?<br/>How about 
      some tea?</center>
<p>Buffy reacts to the voice. Turns. 
      <p>REVEAL JOYCE 
      <p>Standing over Buffy at the table. Smiling at her lovingly. A beat as 
      Buffy looks happily stunned to see her- 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Mom?</center>
<p>But then her expression closes. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You're not real.</center>
<p>Joyce reacts completely naturally. Bemused. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Okay. Is that slang, like - "you're<br/>not for real?" Or- 

      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're The First.</p></center>
<p>Now Joyce looks concerned. She speaks with genuine compassion. Buffy 
      tries not to give into it - but it's hard. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>You're so tired, baby. You're not<br/>making sense. Maybe 
      you should get<br/>some sleep- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No- 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>You can't win against this thing.<br/>Not if you don't rest. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Stop. Stop being like this. It's<br/>a lie. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>I don't want to scare you. But I<br/>want you to take care. You 
      need to<br/>wake up. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What? 
      <p>XANDER (O.C.)<br/>You're dreaming.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>SMASH CUT: 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>CLOSE ON BUFFY 
      <p>She's asleep at the table, head on her arms. Everything else is exactly 
      as it was in the previous scene. Willow is next to her, Andrew is tied up 
      and unconscious in the corner, etc. Except Joyce is gone and Xander stands 
      over Buffy, shaking her gently. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Wake up, Buff.</center>
<p>Buffy's eyes open. She sits up, disoriented. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Did you see it? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>There's nothing to see. You were<br/>doing a little dream 
      talking, that's<br/>all. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You okay? What did you see?</p></p></p></center>
<p>A beat. Buffy looks haunted, but she tries to shake it off. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Nothing.<br/>(then)<br/>It was nothing.</center>
<p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>BLACK 
      <p>We hear the SOUND OF A BODY BEING DRAGGED ALONG A DIRT FLOOR. 
      <p>INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - DAY 
      <p>SPIKE'S POV: 
      <p>SPIKE'S eyes flicker open and he sees that he's being yanked along the 
      floor of an underground cavern by THE UBERVAMP. The cavern is LIT BY A 
      FIRE THAT BURNS ON THE GROUND, and he can see glimpses of THE BRINGERS, as 
      they do the ritual chanting that we saw them do way back when in AMENDS. 
      <p>ON UBERVAMP: 
      <p>As he tosses Spike into a corner. He looks dreadful. He's white as a 
      sheet, all the blood drained from him - and the cuts we saw inflicted upon 
      him in the last episode are far from healed. 
      <p>The Ubervamp starts pacing the cavern, agitated. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE/FIRST (O.C.)<br/>Go on, give him a kick then.</center>
<p>Now we see that THE FIRST is present in the form of Spike in all his 
      WILLIAM THE BLOODY GLORY. Long coat, twisted grin... He turns his 
      attentions on the actual SPIKE now. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE/FIRST<br/>Always liked that, didn't you?</center>
<p>The First steps forward and MORPHS into DRUSILLA. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST<br/>Kick a dolly when he's down. That<br/>was your 
      style.</center>
<p>The Ubervamp brutally kicks Spike, then returns to pacing. 
      Drusilla/First smiles, nods to the Ubervamp. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>Has buckets of energy, poor 
      dear.<br/>Been layin' in wait for his moment.<br/>Since before the bug 
      walked.<br/>(to Ubervamp)<br/>There, there, pet. Soon as the moon<br/>comes, 
      you'll have your carnage.<br/>Little girls tear so easily... Like<br/>pink 
      paper...</center>
<p>Spike tries to sit up, to gather himself, but he's too wasted. He falls 
      back. Drusilla/First gazes at him, dispassionately. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>'Til then - we'll have our way 
      with<br/>this one. Got it coming, he does.</center>
<p>The Ubervamp's eyes grow murderous. He turns toward Spike. 
      <p>OFF SPIKE 
      <p>As the Ubervamp approaches, blocking out Spike's broken form. 
      <p>

      <p>CLOSE ON ANDREW 
      <p>Still passed out. Then a bunch of WATER SPLASHES IN HIS FACE. He reacts 
      a tiny bit, then slumps again. 
      <p>REVEAL 
      <p>ANYA and DAWN watching him intently - Anya with an empty cup in her 
      hand They're alone in the living room at the moment. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>That was something. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Maybe if you threw <u>hot</u> water on him. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Good thinking.</p></p></center>
<p>They both abruptly head out of the room, but Buffy steps in, changed 
      into fresh clothes. Both Anya and Dawn immediately fall onto the couch, 
      trying to look nonchalant. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Nothing. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(thrown)<br/>Oh - I thought you were going to ask<br/>what we 
      were doing- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, I-</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy's interrupted by ANDREW'S SPUTTERING COUGH as he wakes. Anya and 
      Dawn JUMP up from the couch, move to Andrew. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Look who's awake! 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Silly Andrew you drooled all over<br/>yourself.</p></center>
<p>Buffy looks at them both suspiciously. But Andrew distracts her- 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>I'm - I was about to be dead,<br/>(to Buffy/awed)<br/>You 
      saved me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>For the time being.<br/>(super menacing)<br/>But if you don't 
      tell us what we need<br/>to know - I'm going to offer you to<br/>The First 
      on a platter and let him<br/>chop you into tiny pieces.</p></center>
<p>PUSH IN ON ANDREW, looking scared. Like he's going to talk. But then he 
      stops. Confused. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>The first what?</center>
<p>Now the whole thing devolves. Gets real chatty. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>It's the name of the evil thing that<br/>pretended to be 
      Warren and got you to<br/>kill Jonathan. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Ah.<br/>(then)<br/>Not very ominous sounding. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>It is if you understand the context- 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>No, an evil name should be, like, Lex<br/>or Voldemort or- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(fed up)<br/>Hey. I was intimidating here. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Oh - sorry. Go ahead. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Forget it. Where's the Seal?</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALB HIGH SCHOOL - BASEMENT - DAY 
      <p>Andrew now leads Buffy, Dawn and Xander through a tunnel in the 
      basement. Andrew's clearly jumpy. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>It's around that corner. I think. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Better be right this time. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I told you I wasn't sure- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Maybe you should get sure. I'm sick<br/>of the-</p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander stops as they turn a corner. The Seal lies in the pit in front 
      of them, but THE FIRST, SPIKE and THE UBERVAMP are long gone. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Whoa. Check out the goat-heady<br/>badness. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What does it do? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I don't know. Something not good.<br/>It didn't work 
      'cause...<br/>(re: Jonathan/guilty)<br/>There wasn't enough blood-<br/>(tries 
      to leave)<br/>Okay.</p></p></center>
<p>BUFFY catches him with a hand. Not so fast. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (O.C.)<br/>There's blood on this. Lots.</center>
<p>REVEAL 
      <p>Dawn standing near the CREEPY DEVICE THAT SPIKE WAS STRAPPED TO IN EP. 
      NINE. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Looks like The First made another<br/>Sacrifice. Or a music 
      video.</center>
<p>Buffy looks worried by this new revelation. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>The Seal could have been activated.<br/>Maybe that's what 
      The First wanted<br/>Spike for. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(panicky)<br/>That was not there before. I had<br/>nothing to 
      do with that. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Thanks for clearing that up. 'Cause<br/>otherwise we might 
      have thought you<br/>were up to no good here at the<br/>satanic manhole 
      cover.<br/>(then)<br/><u>You killed your best friend</u>.</p></p></center>
<p>Andrew deflates. His remorse clear. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>He's in a place of joy and peace. He<br/>told me. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>No. Nobody told you. You got<br/>tricked by a fake ghost- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Guys-</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy tosses one of the SHOVELS that Andrew and Jonathan used to 
      uncover the Seal in their direction. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Can we save the encounter session?<br/>We need to 
      cover this thing up.<br/>Whatever it does, we can't leave it<br/>exposed 
      like this.</center>
<p>A beat. Xander picks up the shovel and hands it to Andrew. Andrew 
      reluctantly joins Buffy in filling in the pit. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - BASEMENT - ANOTHER AREA - DAY 
      <p>It's a little bit later. Andrew, still holding his shovel, and Xander 
      walk ahead of Dawn and Buffy, who also carries her shovel. They are all 
      dirty from re-filling the pit. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Man, this place gives me the creeps.<br/>It's like in 
      Wonder Woman, issue 297-<br/>299- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(a reflex)<br/>"Catacombs" Yeah. With 
the<br/>skeleton.</p></center>

<p>Andrew looks at Xander with surprise - gets a "one of us" look on his 
      face. Xander tries to pretend like he didn't just massively geek out. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>This way. Move it.</center>
<p>Xander gives Andrew a manly shove toward the stairs. 
      <p>ANGLE ON BUFFY AND DAWN 
      <p>Who are lagging behind. Buffy looks stressed. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>So what next? We found the Seal but<br/>no Spike... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm not sure. The First was camped<br/>underground last time I 
      found it, but<br/>who knows-</p></center>
<p>Dawn and Buffy both startle as PRINCIPAL WOOD emerges from another 
      corridor, A DIRTY SHOVEL OF HIS OWN over his shoulder. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Buffy 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hey-</p></center>
<p>They eye each other. And the shovels. An odd beat. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I thought you were- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Sick! She was. Vomiting and...<br/>oozing from various places. 
      And- 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I remember. Please don't go on.

<p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Anyway I'm all better now.</center>
<p>Buffy eyes Principal Wood's shovel again. He notices. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Oh - yeah. Somebody left it in the<br/>courtyard. 
      I was just returning it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's some full service Principal-<br/>ing. Wow. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>I try.</p></p></center>
<p>Now Wood looks at Buffy's shovel. Waits. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh. And... I was just down here<br/>helping Dawnie with 
      her project. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>For science. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We buried a... time capsule. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Hello people of the future! Kids now<br/>like Red Bull and 
      Jackass! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay. We'd better go.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They start to move off. But Wood stops them with- 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Buffy. If you are feeling better -<br/>I'd like 
      you back at work. I've been<br/>wait-listing students who want to 
      see<br/>you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(genuine)<br/>Right. Sorry about that. I've just<br/>been ill 
      and... stuff. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>It's fine. I understand. But things<br/>are backing 
      up. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No problem. I'll be back tomorrow.<br/>One-hundred percent 
      ooze-free me. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Good.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>And they all move off. Principal Wood and Buffy look back at each other 
      - suspicious. What was that all about? 
      <p>OMITTED 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY 
      <p>Xander moves into the dining area, where the shades are drawn and 
      candles light the room. Willow sits at one end of the table, setting up a 
      locator spell. Anya's helping her. Dawn does research on her laptop. 
      <p>Buffy paces anxiously at the other end of the table. Xander approaches 
      her while Will and Anya start the spell in the background. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>How's it going? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Dawn's trying to find anything she<br/>can on the Seal of 
      Danzalthar and<br/>Will's going to do a locator spell,<br/>see if she can 
      find The First.</p></center>
<p>Xander sees Buffy's agitation. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Why don't you go get some rest?<br/>You've been up for, 
      like, two days.<br/>We'll call you if we find anything. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I couldn't sleep. Too much going on. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>It'll be okay, Buff. We've faced<br/>this kind of stuff 
      before. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You didn't see The First. I did. I<br/>felt it. This thing 
      is-</p></p></p></center>
<p>WHOOSH! 
      <p>There is AN EXPLOSION from the area where the spell is being done. It 
      sends ANYA flying. WIND FILLS THE ROOM and things SCATTER EVERYWHERE. 
      <p>CLOSE ON WILLOW 
      <p>Who holds onto the table as the smoke from the spell TWISTS INTO HER 
      NOSTRILS. Will rears back and SCREAMS as her EYES AND HAIR GO BLACK. She 
      EXHALES and the GIANT FORM OF THE FIRST, in it's true appearance (the form 
      it took in AMENDS) emerges from her mouth. Then immediately gets sucked 
      back. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Will!</center>
<p>Willow whips around and BLASTS BUFFY ACROSS THE ROOM with MAGIC. Speaks 
      in a demonic voice (the voice of The First.} 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW/ FIRST<br/>You only make me stronger.</center>
<p>CRASH! Xander, unnoticed by Willow/First, has snatched the bowl that 
      held the spell ingredients and SMASHED IT against the wall. Just as 
      suddenly as everything started - it all GOES BACK TO NORMAL. Will's eyes 
      and hair - everything. 
      <p>A stunned beat. Then Willow's legs give out. She falls to the floor, 
      freaked - near tears. Buffy and the others rush to her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Will- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(panicky)<br/>I feel it. It's still in me...</p></center>
<p>Buffy holds Willow tightly, trying to calm her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>It's not, it's gone. You're okay. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't want to hurt anybody, Buffy.<br/>Don't let it make me. 
      Oh, God... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I won't. You're okay. We just, we<br/>won't use magic to fight 
      this thing.<br/>Not until we know what we're doing. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I can't. I can't. I'm sorry...</p></p></p></center>
<p>Off BUFFY, fear and anger playing across her features. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - FOYER - DAY 
      <p>A bit later. Buffy, ready for a fight, prepares to leave. Straps a 
      weapon on. Everybody's upset, watching her. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>At least let me come with you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm going alone. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You said yourself you don't know how<br/>to fight The First. 
      Or even where it<br/>is.</p></p></center>
<p>BUFFY reaches for the door- 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>It's out there - and it's hurting my<br/>friends. I'll 
      find it-</center>
<p>She stops. Stunned. GILES stands in the doorway. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Buffy. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Giles?</p></center>
<p>Buffy steps forward, about to hug him, but she's stopped when THREE 
      YOUNG GIRLS move into the house. 
      <p>They are MOLLY, ANNABELLE AND KENNEDY. And they are all potential 
      Slayers. 
      <p>MOLLY, 14 or 15, is a Brit of East Indian heritage. She's cute, pudgy. 
      <p>Her style is very "Ghost World." Pigtails and a miniskirt, ripped 
      stockings, a lunch box for a purse... 
      <p>ANNABELLE, 16, is a sleek, athletic upper-class Brit. She's a bit of a 
      snob. Very into her training, a tad humorless. 
      <p>KENNEDY, 19, the oldest of the bunch. She's tough and wry - takes all 
      the mysticism associated with the Slayer gig with a serious grain of salt. 

      <p>
<center>MOLLY<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Nice place. Bit of a mess.</center>
<p>Kennedy looks at Buffy, unimpressed. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>This is the Slayer? Huh.</center>
<p>The girls blow past her. Buffy looks to Giles, double stunned now. He 
      responds, a tad wry. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Sorry to barge in. I'm afraid we<br/>have a slight 
      apocalypse.</center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SUMMERS' HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
      <p>It's a few moments after the act break and everyone is gathered in the 
      living room. Buffy, Willow, Xander, Anya, Dawn, Giles and his charges - 
      three Potential Slayer girls. 
      <p>Oh - Andrew's still tied up in the corner. 
      <p>The mood is somber - Giles has some splain'n to do. 
      <p>(NOTE: It is VERY important that GILES not touch or be touched by 
      anything. He can walk and talk - but he can't fiddle or cuddle or caress. 
      Got it?) 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(re: girls)<br/>They're all Slayers? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Potential Slayers. Waiting for one<br/>to be 
      called.<br/>(then)<br/>There were many more like them, all<br/>over the 
      world. Now there's only a<br/>handful - and they're all on their<br/>way to 
      Sunnydale.</p></center>
<p>Buffy's expression grows dark. This is what she's been seeing in her 
      dreams 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>The others were murdered.</center>
<p>FLASH! 
      <p>We see the GIRL FROM ISTANBUL (EPISODE ONE) get stabbed. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.C.)<br/>In cold blood.</center>
<p>FLASH! 
      <p>Now the GERMAN GIRL (from EPISODE TWO) meets the same fate. 
      <p>NOW WE'RE BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>As well as their Watchers.</center>
<p>FLASH! 
      <p>We hear GILES OVER images of Robson, as he finds his dead charge, but 
      we do <u>not</u> see the attack by the Bringers (FROM EPISODE EIGHT.) 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.C.)<br/>We all feared this day would come.<br/>When there'd 
      be an attack, not just<br/>against an individual slayer, but<br/>against the 
      whole line...</center>
<p>AGAIN, WE'RE BACK ON GILES IN THE LIVING ROOM. 
      <p>Buffy looks to Giles - getting it. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>The First - that's what it wants. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes. To erase all the Slayers-in-<br/>training and their 
      Watchers, along<br/>with their methods... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And then Faith. Then me. And with<br/>all the potentials gone, 
      and no way<br/>of making another...<br/>(then)<br/>It's the end. There's no 
      more<br/>Slayer. Ever.</p></p></center>
<p>A collective chill runs through the group Then- 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>(to Giles)<br/>We haven't been able to find 
      anything<br/>on The First. No documentation. 
      <p>GILES<br/>That's because it pre-dates written<br/>history... And it 
      rarely shows its<br/>true face. The only record of it I<br/>know was in the 
      library of the<br/>Council. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>What about the Council? What do they<br/>say about this? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Gone. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Obliterated. They were in session...<br/>There was an 
      explosion.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>A beat as the Scoobies take this in, stunned. Then- 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>So all the records are destroyed?</center>
<p>Giles looks to ANNABELLE. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Annabelle-</center>
<p>Annabelle steps forward, pulls some files and books from her backpack. 
      Puts them on the coffee table. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>That's what's left. The mystic<br/>secrets of The 
      Watchers, and whatever<br/>I could find on The First.<br/>(off their 
      surprise)<br/>When I learned what was happening,<br/>I... stole these. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>And blew the Council up? See, that's<br/>what happens when 
      you're all stuffy<br/>and repressed - you over-react. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Not - I didn't... It must have been<br/>an agent of The First, 
      after my<br/>little burglary session.<br/>(then)<br/>The knowledge in the 
      files had to be<br/>protected. There wasn't time for<br/>bureaucracy or 
      debate, but the<br/>Council knows no other way. 
      <p>ANDREW (O.C.)<br/>And it cost them their lives!</p></p></p></center>
<p>Everyone turns to see a forgotten Andrew, tied up in the corner. He's 
      totally caught up in the story. Enthralled. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Go on. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Can we gag him?</p></center>
<p>Xander obliges as the talk continues. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd) (to Giles)<br/>What do the records say about 
      The<br/>First? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Very little. It can change form, but<br/>only appears in the 
      guise of people<br/>who've passed away. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Our "ghosts." 
      <p>GILES<br/>Also, it's not corporeal. It can't<br/>touch or fight on it's 
      own. It works<br/>through the people it manipulates and<br/>its followers, 
      The Bringers-</p></p></p></center>
<p>Kennedy pipes up now. Clearly the boldest of the three Slayerettes. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Those freaks in the black robes.</center>
<p>Now Molly jumps in too. 
      <p>
<center>MOLLY<br/>Yeah. With the hoodies and the crazy<br/>alphabet 
      eyes.<br/>(shy again)<br/>I didn't see. I just heard that- 
      <p>ANNABELLE<br/>(embarrassed)<br/>Shhh. Molly. Mr. Giles doesn't need<br/>us 
      prattling on...</p></center>
<p>Molly shuts up, but glares at Annabelle. Giles looks weary. Then- 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>The First is unlike anything we've<br/>faced before. 
      There's evil, and then<br/>there's the thing that made evil...<br/>The 
      source. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And that's what this claims to be? 
      <p>GILES<br/>That's what it is. It has eternities<br/>to act, endless 
      resources. To defeat<br/>it...<br/>(at a loss)<br/>Honestly, I don't 
      know...<br/>(then)<br/>but we have to find a way. If the<br/>Slayer line is 
      eliminated, then the<br/>Hellmouth will have no guardian. The<br/>balance 
      will be destroyed... It falls<br/>to you, Buffy. We'll do what we<br/>can - 
      but only you have the strength<br/>to protect these girls - and 
      the<br/>world - against what's coming.</p></p></center>
<p>A beat as Buffy takes this in. A new weight on her. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>But no pressure. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>That's it? That's the plan?</p></center>
<p>Everybody turns to Kennedy. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>I don't see how one person, even 
      a<br/>Slayer, can protect us. I saw what<br/>those Bringer guys can do. They 
      tore<br/>my Watcher apart- 
      <p>GILES<br/>Of course, we'll use all our<br/>resources, but- 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>And if this thing is the root of all<br/>Evil, isn't the 
      Hellmouth it's number<br/>one vacation spot? Don't you think<br/>we should 
      be hiding our asses away on<br/>the other side of the globe? 
      <p>ANNABELLE<br/>Kennedy- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, she's not wrong. We should have<br/>more muscle. That's why 
      we have to<br/>find Spike. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Yeah, he'll help. If he's not crazy.<br/>Or killing people. Or 
      dead. Or, you<br/>know, all of tile above.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Off Buffy, who takes this in, worried. 
      <p>INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - DAY 
      <p>WE ARE UNDER WATER 
      <p>We see SPIKE STRUGGLING AS A HAND HOLDS HIM UNDER. The water is green, 
      murky, and he fights and fights... But loses. His body goes still. Silent. 
      Almost peaceful. 
      <p>NOW WE'RE ABOVE GROUND 
      <p>And we see that THE UBERVAMP: is holding SPIKE beneath the surface of a 
      filthy pool of water that bubbles at the surface of the cavern. He tosses 
      Spike's body from the water, and it hits the floor with a sick wet SPLAT. 
      Lies there. 
      <p>Drusilla/First watches from a distance, pleased. Speaks to the 
      UBERVAMP:. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST<br/>That's why our kind make such 
      good<br/>dollies.</center>
<p>Spike suddenly SPUTTERS TO LIFE. He coughs up water, then gasps 
      horribly - fighting to get the water out of his lungs. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>Hard to kill.</center>
<p>Spike stares at Drusilla/First, trying to find his breath but it won't 
      come. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>Tried to enlighten little 
      Buffy,<br/>didn't you? Spilled our secrets like<br/>seed...</center>
<p>Now Dru gets close, nearly whispers. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>But you forgot. I say what you 
      tell,<br/>and what you know. I say when this<br/>is 
      over.<br/>(menacing)<br/>And I'm not done with you yet, 
      not<br/>nearly.</center>
<p>She nods to the UBERVAMP, who violently shoves Spike back in the water 
      - to be drowned all over again. 
      <p>EXT. SUNNYDALE MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Giles and Buffy move down Sunnydale's main street, which is decorated 
      for CHRISTMAS. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>(confused)<br/>This place, where you last saw 
      The<br/>First, you say it was in a Christmas<br/>tree lot? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Under it. There was a hidden cavern,<br/>happened to be under a 
      tree lot.<br/>Those Bringer guys were doing some<br/>kind of 
ritual.</p></center>
<p>A beat. Buffy looks at Giles, vulnerable - shaken. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Giles. This is bad, isn't it? I<br/>mean, a new 
      kind of bad. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(nods)<br/>Just in time for Christmas.</p></center>
<p>Buffy looks around at the decorations. At the happy folk doing their 
      shopping - oblivious to the big bad around them. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I didn't even realize it was<br/>December. Maybe when we 
      get home we<br/>should decorate the rubble.<br/>(then)<br/>You think you'll 
      ever show up for a<br/>real visit? The kind where the world<br/>isn't about 
      to end?</center>
<p>They both smile a little sadly. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>If we survive this, I promise to. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Good. 'Cause I miss you. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I miss you too.</p></p></center>
<p>They walk on in silence. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT 
      <p>This is a BIG ASS ONER, meant to convey the heavy activity in the 
      Buffy-verse now that it includes three wouldbe Slayers (and one hostage.) 
      We start in the living room. Xander is boarding up the windows. Andrew is 
      watching him. Ungagged now. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>So, how long have you followed Buffy? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I don't "follow" her. She's my best<br/>friend. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(not buying it)<br/>Huh.<br/>(then)<br/>She seems like a good 
      leader. Her<br/>hair is shiny.<br/>(then)<br/>Does she make you stab 
      things?</p></p></center>
<p>Now WE PICK UP WILLOW and KENNEDY. Willow is just finishing making the 
      sofa up as a bed, and is then on the move with an armful of linens. 
      Kennedy follows her. We move with them as they head out of the living room 
      and toward the stairs. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Annabelle can sleep here, Molly can<br/>sleep in Dawn's 
      room- 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Not if Dawn actually wants to sleep.<br/>Molly'll talk her 
      ear off. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Okay, then Molly down here, you with<br/>Dawn and Annabelle 
      with me. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Bad idea. Annabelle snores. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(exasperated)<br/>You want to do the 
      sleeping<br/>arrangements?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Kennedy grabs the linens. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>(a little flirtatious)<br/>Okay. You better not hog the 
      covers.</center>
<p>This stops Will. She doesn't quite know what to say. Kennedy grins and 
      continues up the stairs. Will, thrown, turns, encounters DAWN, who's just 
      come out of the KITCHEN. She's got an apron on and kinda looks a mess. 
      Dawn indicates Kennedy. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Does she wanna eat? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What? Huh? She's - she's new. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Well Annabelle and Molly are starved<br/>and I totally burned 
      the mac and<br/>cheese.</p></p></center>
<p>They move through the dining room toward the kitchen, Willow still very 
      thrown by new flirtiness. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Ah, I'll add some hot sauce and tell<br/>them it's 
      an American thing. Say<br/>it's blackened.</center>
<p>NOW THEY ENTER THE KITCHEN 
      <p>Where Anya's DUMPING OUT THE MAC AND CHEESE. Molly goes through the 
      cabinets and Annabelle reads the label on some cereal. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Or we can order a pizza. 
      <p>ANNABELLE<br/>As long as it's plain. I'm veggie- 
      <p>MOLLY<br/>Daft, you mean- 
      <p>ANNABELLE<br/>Just because you'll eat any kind of<br/>trash-</p></p></p></center>
<p>She's stopped by Molly's happy exclamation. 
      <p>
<center>MOLLY<br/>Brill! Biscuits.</center>
<p>Molly pulls a package of COOKIES from a shelf. Starts munching. Looks 
      to Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>MOLLY (cont'd)<br/>You don't mind? I have a case of the<br/>nerves 
      after Mr. Giles' lecture. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Knock yourself out.<br/>(takes a cookie)<br/>I feel a cookie 
      problem coming on<br/>myself.</p></center>
<p>Dawn holds the cookies out and all the girls give up on the dinner 
      idea. Chow down. 
      <p>13 THRU 16 OMITTED 
      <p>EXT. DIRT LOT - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and Giles wander the dirt lot where the Christmas tree lot used 
      to be. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>So there was an entrance to the cave<br/>above ground 
      here? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was around<br/>here 
somewhere.</p></center>
<p>ON GILES 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>So we'll just keep-</center>
<p>CRASH! Giles TURNS to see that BUFFY is gone. Where she was standing 
      there is nothing but a HOLE that was COVERED BY SOME DIRT AND OLD BOARDS. 
      A stunned beat. Then- 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (O.C.)<br/>Found it.</center>
<p>Giles rushes to the hole. Looks in. 
      <p>GILES POV 
      <p>Buffy, in the cave, picks herself up. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Good lord, are you alright? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Peachy. Except my knees bend<br/>backwards 
      now.<br/>(then)<br/>Stay up there, Giles. I'll check it<br/>out.</p></center>
<p>INT. CAVE - NIGHT 
      <p>BUFFY wanders the cave, which is lit only by moonlight streaking 
      through the hole above. The cave appears empty, but there is a small 
      tunnel at the far end of the cave and some other craggy spots where 
      something might hide. 
      <p>WE STAY CLOSE ON BUFFY 
      <p>As she calls back to Giles. 
      <p>As she ventures further into the cave. Schmuky the bait. She hears a 
      sound behind her and we do a classic horror movie scare as Buffy turns - 
      sees nothing - and turns back to face THE UBERVAMP. 
      <p>WHOMP! The Ubervamp UPPERCUTS BUFFY and she goes FLYING INTO THE ROOF 
      OF THE CAVE - rock and debris rain down from the point of impact. 
      <p>THUD! Buffy hits the ground hard and the Ubervamp attacks, kicking the 
      hell out of her. Buffy jumps up, grabs a stalactite-type formation growing 
      from the top of the cave and SWINGS HERSELF at the Ubervamp, pounding him 
      with her heels. The Ubervamp falls back. 
      <p>FIGHTY, McFIGHT FIGHT. 
      <p>What distinguishes this fight is that Buffy barely stays upright. The 
      Ubervamp keeps dealing staggering blows, and doesn't even seem winded. 
      <p>Buffy looks scared. She's bleeding from a few cuts now, looking spent. 
      <p>The Ubervamp swings, connects. Swings again, but Buffy drops and rolls, 
      coming up with STAKE IN HAND. Before he can react, Buffy DRIVES THE STAKE 
      DEEP INTO THE UBERVAMP'S HEART. The Ubervamp ROARS with fury. And that's 
      it. He doesn't dust. 
      <p>In fact - he grins, a bit twisted, and pulls the stake out. 
      <p>OFF BUFFY

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CAVE - NIGHT 
      <p>Where we left off. Buffy is stunned, terrified 
      <p>Be hold on Buffy, incredulous, as - WHACK! Ubervamp hits her with a 
      wicked backhanded punch. She hits the ground, hard. 
      <p>Ubervamp regards the STAKE he's now holding in his hand. A novelty. And 
      one he adjusts to instantly. He rushes forward. 
      <p>Buffy's POV: Ubervamp, holding her STAKE, attacks. Lunging with 
      lightning-speed right for her, stake in hand, bringing it down upon her... 

      <p>Ubervamp stabs where Buffy was - she jerks away. The stake hits the 
      rocky ground - and SPLINTERS inches from her face. 
      <p>Buffy gets to her feet - and gets taken <u>off</u> her feet with a 
      brutal, bone-crunching gut-punch from the Ubervamp. 
      <p>And now it gets nasty. And extremely one-sided. Buffy takes punishment 
      - repeated blows to the body, the face... and she can't get one shot in in 
      retaliation. 
      <p>The Ubervamp slaps a big hand around her throat and lifts her up off 
      the ground. Buffy pulls at the hand on her throat, but it will not budge. 
      <p>The Ubervamp OPENS HIS JAWS to bite her. And we see, in close-up, that 
      these fangs are bigger, bloodier, just plain uglier than any she's seen 
      before. 
      <p>Buffy grabs hold of a small stalactite, rips it from its moorings - she 
      SMASHES the Ubervamp with it. 
      <p>Ubervamp loosens its grip on Buffy just enough for her to fall, 
      painfully, to the ground. 
      <p>Buffy LEAPS to the nearest rock wall and starts scrambling up, fast as 
      she can, hand-and-footholds crumbling... 
      <p>She gets halfway up the rock wall when the Ubervamp's HAND shoots out 
      of nowhere and GRABS her ankle. 
      <p>EXT. DIRT LOT - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy struggles, pulling herself up out of the cave hole - almost 
      freeing herself when she suddenly gets YANKED BACK - almost back in, her 
      hands digging into the soft earth around her, fingers leaving treads... 
      <p>Ubervamp holds tight to Buffy's ankle. Prepares to bite, opening its 
      fanged mouth with incredible speed... just as Buffy kicks - and just 
      barely manages to free herself. 
      <p>EXT. DIRT LOT - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy, freaked, pulls herself all the way up and out of the cave hole, 
      looking up to see: 
      <p>Buffy's POV: A SILHOUETTE standing before her. Giles. The Ubervamp pops 
      out - then retreats in snarling fear. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>It's gone.</center>
<p>Buffy, still on the ground and breathing heavily, looks back to the 
      hole then up at Giles, her fear showing. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What was it?</center>
<p>We see the light which makes Giles a silhouette: SUNLIGHT. Dawn has 
      arrived. 
      <p>INT SUMMERS' HOME - KITCHEN - DAY 
      <p>Buffy enters, looking beat. Followed by Giles. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Don't want to wake the others just<br/>yet, give us a 
      chance to...</center>
<p>Buffy stops short - closes her eyes and sighs. Reverse reveals: The 
      three Potential Slayers eating breakfast, having made themselves at home. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Sorry about the British invasion. 
      <p>MOLLY<br/>We've been up for hours. 
      <p>ANNABELLE<br/>Four p.m. London time. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>You all right? You look...</p></p></p></center>
<p>She stops, not wanting to say what Buffy looks like. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I'm fine. Got in a fight, is all.</center>
<p>She closes the kitchen door (because Giles did not.) 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You want to tell me with what? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes. But, Buffy, are you sure we<br/>shouldn't discuss this 
      privately? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You mean not in front of the Next<br/>Generation?</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy eyes the Potentials. All of them eager. And unprepared. She 
      considers, shrugs. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>No time to coddle them, Giles.<br/>(to 
      Potentials)<br/>Welcome to the War Room, guys.</center>
<p>A small thrill ripples through the Potentials. Annabelle grabs a pen 
      and pad of paper. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>What you fought was a vampire. But<br/>something more as 
      well.<br/>(beat)<br/>It was a Turok-Han. As Neanderthals<br/>are to human 
      beings, Turok-Han are to<br/>vampires. They're ancient,<br/>primordial, 
      ferociously strong<br/>killing machines which live off<br/>blood, 
      single-minded as animals.<br/>They are the vampires vampires fear.<br/>And 
      until this morning, I thought<br/>they were myth.</center>
<p>Beat as this sinks in. Annabelle, scared, raises her hand. 
      <p>
<center>ANNABELLE<br/>Did you slay it? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No. It's still out there. Somewhere. 
      <p>MOLLY<br/>What does it want? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>All of us dead.</p></p></p></center>
<p>They all have their own reactions to that. Buffy sees. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>But for now it looks like sunlight's<br/>keeping 
      this Ubervamp away. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Then until sunset, Buffy, you should<br/>rest. A few hours 
      sleep will make a<br/>world of difference. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No sleep today. Can't. 
      <p>GILES<br/>But you're exhausted. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Comes with the gig. I don't think<br/>taking on pre-historic 
      evil involves<br/>nap time.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She starts to head out. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Sorry, Potential guys. I know you<br/>came a long 
      way and you want to get<br/>into this, but for now the best thing<br/>you 
      can do is sit tight, wait it out<br/>I'll go to work, find out what I 
      can,<br/>be back before sunset.</center>
<p>Buffy starts out. Giles interrupts her. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Buffy - how exactly do you plan to<br/>research something 
      as widespread as<br/>The First? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I have the best plan ever.</p></center>
<p>And on that promise we cut to: 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>CLOSE-UP of a computer screen: A SEARCH ENGINE displays an empty box 
      reading "SEARCH." 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>Yes. Will, I already re-checked the<br/>basement. I 
      just want to try<br/>something.</center>
<p>The letters E-V-I-L get typed in, and "search" is clicked. 
      <p>Cut to Buffy at her desk, phone cradled between her cheek and shoulder, 
      a venti cup of coffee before her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You know, maybe the First isn't ready<br/>for modern 
      technology...<br/>(reading)<br/>"Results one through ten out of<br/>nine 
      hundred thousand, five<br/>hundred, seventeen." Okay.<br/>(beat)<br/>I gotta 
      narrow this down - I'll call<br/>you back.</center>
<p>BUFFY hangs up, thinks, then types some more, a bit pleased with 
      herself. As she types we hear a voice: 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (O.S.)<br/>(reading)<br/>"Manifestations of 
      Evil?"</center>
<p>Buffy jumps a bit at her desk, turns to see: 
      <p>Principal Wood. Standing calmly, if curiously over her, reading her 
      screen. Buffy looks busted. Then types some more. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>(reading)<br/>"...In the Movies."<br/>(to 
      Buffy)<br/>You're looking for evil movies? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I know it's not the all-time most<br/>Kosher use of office 
      hours, but, uh,<br/>I'm facing a little downtime here and<br/>what can I 
      say? I just love those<br/>evil, evil movies.<br/>(beat)<br/>Like "The 
      Exorcist" or "Blair<br/>Witch". 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>As opposed to, say, Rob<br/>Schneider's oeuvre. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Different evil. 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You okay?<br/>(beat)<br/>You've looked better.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy, a little hurt, shuts off the computer. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>I'm not that big a fan of 
      scary<br/>movies. Even the hokey ones<br/>sometimes, they go to a place 
      that,<br/>I think kids could stand to avoid. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, this isn't for the kids... 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Yeah, yeah... I'm only saying that<br/>once you see 
      true Evil, it can have<br/>some serious afterburn. And then you<br/>can't 
      unsee what you saw. Ever.</p></p></center>
<p>They stare at each other. Principal Wood shrugs. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>(friendly)<br/>Just one opinion. I'd 
      better be<br/>getting back.</center>
<p>Buffy, a bit shaken, watches as Principal Wood turns back to his 
      office. She manages to say: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What kind of movies do you like?</center>
<p>An enigmatic smile on his face (which we get to see, but Buffy does 
      not), the Principal answers without turning back: 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Me? Mysteries. I love finding out<br/>what's 
      underneath it all in the end.</center>
<p>BUFFY looks after him, frowning. And we hear a PRE-LAP: 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (O.S.)<br/>Think of it as a game.</center>
<p>INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - DAY 
      <p>Spike, beaten and bloodied, one eye swollen shut, watches as 
      Drusilla/First paces back and forth before him. She's having a good time, 
      He is not. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST<br/>A fun and funny game, without all the<br/>rules. 
      Or any of that bothersome<br/>winning part. But, still, there are<br/>sides. 
      You have to choose a side,<br/>Spike.</center>
<p>Drusilla/First stops, bending backward, face close to Spike's. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>And then we can fly, be free, 
      and<br/>visit all our friends as they come<br/>squirming up from out the 
      earth.</center>
<p>She does a little dance for him. It's not unsexy. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>I know you like a good wriggle. 
      And<br/>a giggle. And a squiggle... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You're not Drusilla. 
      <p>DRUSILLA/FIRST<br/>(giggles)<br/>I'm really not. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>She was crazier 'n you. 
      <p>DRUSILLA/FIRST<br/>(hurt)<br/>Dad-dy. No kicking. It's 
      almost<br/>Christmas Day today and you've gone<br/>spoiling it. I've been so 
      very good<br/>all year...</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She leans in, lips close to his. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>But I'll be bad if you like.</center>
<p>And out of nowhere - WHUMP! - Spike takes a brutal shot to the head. 
      Drusilla/First steps back, pleased. 
      <p>Reveal the Ubervamp as it prepares to deliver another blow to Spike's 
      head. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>Bad Daddy. Needs a caning. 
      Never<br/>learned his headmaster's lesson while<br/>all the school bells 
      ring and ring<br/>and ring and ring...</center>
<p>WHAM! Another shot to the head. Spike takes it. Drusilla/First steps 
      forward, curious. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>Choose a side. Choose our side. 
      You<br/>know that it's delicious. What do<br/>you say? Hmm?</center>
<p>Spike looks up at Drusilla/First. Grins. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Dru... Love...<br/>(teeth grit)<br/>Get bent. 
      <p>DRUSILLA/FIRST<br/>(pouting)<br/>Stupid stubborn daddy.</p></center>
<p>Languid and sad, she sashays to a corner, caught up in the world of her 
      own unique dance as we hear the sounds of Spike getting mercilessly 
      PUMMELED. 
      <p>Dru just keeps dancing as the sounds of violence rise... 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY 
      <p>Buffy rises into frame, having just splashed water on her face. She 
      steps back, getting a good look at herself. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(muttering)<br/>"You've looked better," thank you, 
      so<br/>much Mr. Principal sir...</center>
<p>She stops, not in the mood for her own quips. Slowly, she pulls up a 
      sleeve on her blouse. We see the skin beneath the sleeve. It's hideously 
      bruised. Buffy touches the bruise, winces. She starts to roll the sleeve 
      back down again when a HAND enters frame, gently stopping her ... 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - BATHROOM - DAY 
      <p>Buffy looks up at the hand touching her arm we follow her gaze to find 
      Joyce, standing beside her, concerned. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Honey, what happened? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's okay, Mom. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>I tried to warn you, but...<br/>(catches herself)<br/>Right. The 
      last thing you need now<br/>is one of helpful Mom's guilt trips.<br/>I'll 
      get you some ice.</p></p></center>
<p>Joyce starts to leave. Buffy stops her: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>No. Mom, I can't. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Buffy, you have to heal. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't have time. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Are you worried about the sun going<br/>down? Because some 
      things you can't<br/>control. The sun always goes down.<br/>The sun always 
      comes up.<br/>(beat)<br/>Except in L.A., just of late. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Everyone's counting on me. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>They do that. And I'm sorry, but<br/>these friends of yours put 
      too much<br/>pressure on you. They always have. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Something Evil is coming. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Buffy, Evil isn't "coming." It's<br/>already here. Evil is 
      always here.<br/>Don't you know? It's everywhere. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I have to stop it. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>How are you going to do that? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I, I don't know. Yet, but... 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Buffy. No matter what your friends<br/>expect of you, Evil is a 
      part of us.<br/>All of us, it's natural And no one<br/>can stop that. No one 
      can stop<br/>nature. Not even...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>DINGGGGGG! Buffy JOLTS AWAKE, in her chair at her desk, disoriented. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I'm sorry. What were we talking<br/>about?</center>
<p>Buffy looks ahead to see: ROGER, a sensitive sixteen year- old in a 
      flannel shirt, sitting before her, looking pissed. 
      <p>
<center>ROGER<br/>Only my life. You're just like all<br/>the 
      others...</center>
<p>Roger, no stranger to drama, gathers his things, hurt. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>No. I'm different. I'm, I'm hip and<br/>relate to the 
      young people. Don't<br/>go, uh, uh... 
      <p>ROGER<br/>"Roger?" 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Roger. See, I knew that.</p></p></center>
<p>That does it. Roger leaves, closing the door behind him. Buffy, feeling 
      like hell, shakes her head. 
      <p>And Principal Wood watches from within his office as we hear: 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.S.)<br/>This day's almost over.</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Giles closes the curtains. He talks as he walks - and we see, behind 
      him, it's siege time. Anya, Willow and Dawn each select weapons from the 
      chest and take up position by the windows - serving as sentries. Xander 
      finishes boarding up the windows themselves. Annabelle, Kennedy and Molly 
      sit clustered together, looking useless and scared. BUFFY stands 
      overseeing the proceedings. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>And the sun will go down in...<br/>(checks 
      watch)<br/>...seventeen minutes. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Hey. Junior Slayers. Don't look so<br/>worried. I mean, sure, 
      we may not<br/>know where Spike is, or how to fight<br/>the First, or if and 
      when this Super-<br/>style vampire is gonna attack us 
      all,<br/>however...<br/>(thinks)<br/>House. Boarded up. All we gotta 
      do<br/>now is trap this Ubervamp in the<br/>pantry - and it's game 
      over.</p></center>
<p>He jauntily hammers in one last nail - point made. Willow passes by 
      Xander, on her way to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Xander? Newbies. Let's ease them<br/>into the whole 
      "jokes in the face of<br/>death" thing. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Who's joking? That pantry thing<br/>could 
      work.<br/>(beat)<br/>You saying M. Night Shamyalan lied to<br/>us?</p></center>
<p>Buffy intercedes, speaking to the Potentials: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You'll be okay. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Okay or even better. It's like our<br/>guarantee. Um, 
      Buffy...?</p></center>
<p>Willow takes Buffy aside. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I just... I want you to know, I'm<br/>really 
      sorry about letting you down.<br/>Before, here, with the Magicks 
      going<br/>all "eeeh" and me going all "aaah"<br/>and everything getting all 
      "rrrr..."<br/>(beat)<br/>I'm sorry I can't help. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No one expects you to make everything<br/>right. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Okay, I can't do everything, but I<br/>should be able to do 
      something. I<br/>have so much power. But when I try<br/>to use it... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Don't, okay? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Okay.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow nods. Buffy moves away, conversation over. Except... 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>But you need help, Buffy. I know<br/>you. And I 
      know you'll never admit<br/>it. But you need help.</center>
<p>Willow searches Buffy's face as Buffy wonders how much to let Willow 
      in, here and now. She settles for brave face. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I'll be okay. Okay or better. It's<br/>like my 
      guarantee.</center>
<p>She tries a smile for Willow, and Will returns it, but neither one is 
      buying this. Kennedy interrupts: 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Hey. Are we getting weapons?<br/>Trained fighters, 
      badness coming.<br/>I've heard worse ideas. 
      <p>ANNABELLE<br/>We'll be armed when the Slayer feels<br/>we're ready. 
      <p>MOLLY<br/>I feel ready. 
      <p>ANNABELLE<br/>You're frightened. You must learn to<br/>control your fear. 

      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Hey. You know what would help with<br/>that?<br/>(to 
      Buffy)<br/>Weapons. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't know. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>We're sitting ducks without them. 
      <p>ANNABELLE<br/>We're with the Slayer! Safe as<br/>houses. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>You see the house we're in?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Indeed, it's a busted-up, boarded-up house. 
      <p>
<center>ANNABELLE<br/>(showing fear)<br/>It'll come straight for us, won't 
      it?</center>
<p>Buffy mumbles to Giles, walking away to clear her head. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Better load 'em up.</center>
<p>Giles watches Buffy walk away as he hands out various WEAPONS to the 
      Potential Slayers. 
      <p>Buffy doesn't get far in the claustrophobic space. She hears: 
      <p>OMITTED 30 AND 31 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (O.C.)<br/>Listen to me, man...</center>
<p>ANGLE ON: Over in the far corner, Buffy passes by Xander and Andrew. 
      Andrew is still tied to the chair. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>I've got a bad feeling about this. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Of course you've got a "bad feeling."<br/>Dude. You're tied to 
      a chair. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>No. Well, yeah, but above and beyond<br/>that, I'm telling you 
      my spider-sense<br/>is tingling.<br/>(serious)<br/>This is gonna get hairy. 
      I'm talking<br/>weird with a beard. Better untie me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And this will help us how? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Phht. Okay, I know what you're<br/>thinking. Andrew. Bad guy. 
      You<br/>think I'm a super villain, like Dr.<br/>Doom, or Apokalypse, or, 
      or... the<br/>Riddler.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks to Xander. Xander shrugs, confused, like "I dunno." 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>I admit I went over to the Dark Side.<br/>But 
      only to pick up a couple of<br/>things and now I'm back. 
      I've<br/>learned.<br/>(sincere)<br/>I am good again.</center>
<p>Beat. Buffy talks to Andrew without paying attention, watching Giles 
      hand over axes and swords to a couple of very young looking girls. Sees 
      Dawn by the window with an axe. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(distracted)<br/>And, when were you ever good 
      <i>before</i>? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Okay, technically, never. <i>Touche</i>.</p></center>
<p>BUFFY walks away. Andrew calls after: 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>But I'm like Vader in the last five<br/>minutes 
      of "Jedi," you know, with the<br/>redemptive power of, 
      of...<br/>(wriggling)<br/>Mine is a redemptive struggle 
      of...<br/>(bouncing)<br/>Redemptive epic, which chronicles...</center>
<p>Xander walks away, too. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>These ropes itch.</center>
<p>ANGLE ON: Giles approaches Buffy 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>How we doing on time? 
      <p>GILES<br/>(checking watch)<br/>Sunset should be any minute now.<br/>We've 
      done all we can. Don't worry,<br/>everyone here understands it's 
      you<br/>calling the shots. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Just hope I'm calling the right ones. 
      <p>GILES<br/>You have all my faith. And they're<br/>depending on 
      you.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks down. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh, Giles. Not what I really needed<br/>to hear right... 
      <p>MOLLY (O.S.)<br/>Guys! Slayer Team guys?</p></center>
<p>Molly comes into the room. Looking freaked. 
      <p>
<center>MOLLY<br/>Annabelle split.</center>
<p>Giles and Buffy share an "oh, shit" look and we CUT TO: 
      <p>EXT. INDUSTRIAL AREA STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Annabelle, panicked, running as hard as she can through an INDUSTRIAL 
      AREA STREET. Smokestacks belch smoke in the background, harsh lights 
      abound. 
      <p>She clutches a CROSS to her chest, eyes wide in panic, muttering 
      prayers to herself fast and shallow. She hears a noise. Looks back, seeing 
      nothing but shadows - and running from them. She turns a corner. 
      <p>A HAND juts out and catches her. The UBERVAMP lifts her off her feet. 
      Annabelle SCREAMS. 
      <p>And we cut to the harshly lit industrial street as we hear the scream 
      CUT SHORT by a horrible RIPPING sound, like a side of beef getting pulled 
      in two. 
      <p>And all we see is the cross, flecked with blood, as it hits the tarmac 
      - and lies still. 
      <p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. INDUSTRIAL AREA STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy comes running into frame. She slows, stops. 
      <p>Buffy looks down. 
      <p>We see Annabelle's DEAD BODY. 
      <p>Buffy stands there, over the body, immobile, breathing heavily, 
      absorbing what's just happened. 
      <p>When she is suddenly HIT in the base of the spine, sending her flying 
      violently forward, hitting the ground hard. 
      <p>Buffy whirls, looks up, sees: 
      <p>The Ubervamp. Fear freezes her features a moment, but she puts it away. 

      <p>Buffy rises and unleashes a series of roundhouse kicks - as hard as 
      anything she's ever thrown. They manage to annoy the Ubervamp. Ubervamp 
      roars and punches Buffy - once - hard in the stomach, lifting her off her 
      feet. 
      <p>We hear a CRACK. 
      <p>Buffy hits the ground, scrambling to her feet as the Ubervamp 
      approaches. She gets up, coughs - and wipes her mouth. 
      <p>Blood. Ubervamp rushes Buffy, grabs her, lifting her off her feet - 
      <p>Buffy SPITS in his face. Bloody spit. Ubervamp wipes the bloody spit 
      from his face, regards it - and LICKS HIS HAND. Buffy breaks free from his 
      grip and RUNS. 
      <p>ANGLE ON: A small industrial BUILDING. Buffy heads inside, holding 
      herself up against the doorframe for support a moment, looking back, then 
      disappearing within. 
      <p>INT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy's POV. The unlit WORK SPACE. It's like a machine graveyard. 
      Large, oversized PIPES and CONVEYOR BELTS abound it's all very 
      "Terminator." 
      <p>Buffy, limping, short of breath, rushes into the area as best She can. 
      She seems a dwarfed figure - tiny amidst the massive silhouettes of 
      machinery all around her. 
      <p>ANGLE ON: Ubervamp. Stalking. Looking for more blood. He enters without 
      caution or concern - pure stalking mode. Suddenly, a large METAL PIPE 
      smashes him in the face. 
      <p>Buffy just hit him with a ripped-off section of piping. Ubervamp keeps 
      walking forward, unaffected. 
      <p>He SLAPS the pipe out of her hand. Buffy backs up. Ubervamp stalks 
      forward. Ubervamp throws a series of punches, some connecting, some barely 
      missing, but all of them putting Buffy on pure DEFENSIVE MODE. 
      <p>He's always coming forward, getting stronger, she's always moving 
      backward, getting weaker. 
      <p>Finally he CONNECTS with a shot to the ribs that sends Buffy flying, 
      landing flat on her back, pain etched in her face, clutching her ribs, 
      looking terrified. 
      <p>Buffy scrambles backward. Ubervamp steps into a SHADOW. 
      <p>Buffy, from the ground, just barely grins through gritted teeth. 
      <p>And pulls a rusted lever. The Ubervamp looks up. And we see: 
      <p>Ubervamp's POV: A THREE-TON CRATE of METAL RODS comes rushing down upon 
      him. CRASH! The wood and metal splinter upon thunderous impact. Nothing 
      could survive that. 
      <p>Silence. 
      <p>Buffy slowly, painfully stands. Catches her breath. Walks, limping, 
      away. And we follow her, limping out of the industrial space, as we hear 
      the horrible sound of TWISTING METAL CRASHING. 
      <p>BUFFY turns to see the Ubervamp rising from the twisted metal wreckage. 

      <p>Buffy can't believe it. She RUNS. 
      <p>The Ubervamp lopes after her in long strides. Blocks her way just as 
      she nearly makes it out the building. 
      <p>Ubervamp CATCHES HER. Grabs her. And proceeds to KICK BUFFY'S ASS - 
      quickly and efficiently, each blow doing major damage. Buffy takes the 
      shots, each one sounding like it's breaking bones. 
      <p>Buffy throws one last desperate punch, and - FWAP! - Ubervamp catches 
      Buffy's best punch, holding her fist and freezing it in mid-blow. That's 
      with one hand. The other hand HITS BUFFY so fast, she rockets straight 
      back, hitting the aged brick wall. 
      <p>EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - NIGHT 
      <p>CRASH! Buffy's limp, lifeless body comes smashing THROUGH the rotted 
      old bricks and lands, in a crumpled heap, among a crate of building 
      materials. Knocked unconscious. Dust swirls. Then settles. Buffy does not 
      move. 
      <p>FADE TO BLACK. 
      <p>OMITTED 
      <p>EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - DAY 
      <p>Directly OFF THE BLACKESS, we see a large piece of BROKEN WOOD pulled 
      away from frame, revealing Giles, Xander and Willow, removing wooden 
      shards, looking down upon something within the wreckage... 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>God almighty.</center>
<p>Reverse angle reveals: BUFFY, beaten, bloodied, lying like a broken 
      doll in the wreckage. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA/FIRST (O.S.)<br/>Do you know why you're alive?</center>
<p>INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - NIGHT 
      <p>Drusilla stands before Spike, the seduction game pretty much over. Arms 
      folded, stern, looking cross. Spike looks up at her, fakes a bloody grin. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Never figured you for...<br/>(coughs)<br/>... existential 
      thought, love. I<br/>mean, you hated Paris. 
      <p>DRUSILLA/ FIRST<br/>You're alive for one reason, and one<br/>reason 
      only.<br/>(beat)<br/>Because I wish it. Do you know why<br/>I wish it? 
      Because I'm not done with<br/>you. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Give it up.<br/>(spits)<br/>Whatever you are - whatever you 
      get<br/>away with - I'm out. You can't pull<br/>this puppet's strings 
      anymore. 
      <p>DRUSILLA/FIRST<br/>And what makes you think you have a<br/>choice? What 
      makes you think you<br/>will ever be any good at all in this<br/>world? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>She does.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike looks at her with simple resolve as he lays down his trump card. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Because she believes in me.</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - BUFFY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy's FACE. Looking dead. Lifeless eyes. Completely and utterly 
      defeated as we hear: 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.S.)<br/>... her ribs are smashed, she should<br/>be 
      hospitalized immediately.</center>
<p>We push in, slowly... 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (O.S.)<br/>Could she die? 
      <p>GILES (O.S.)<br/>Despite her healing abilities, I<br/>believe so. I won't 
      lie to you, I<br/>don't know what to do in a situation<br/>like this, 
      because there has never<br/>been a situation like this...</p></center>
<p>The voices fade as we keep moving in, almost floating as tears well up 
      in her eyes, something within her swelling... 
      <p>INT SUMMERS' HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Giles stands at the dining room table, addressing Willow, Dawn, Xander, 
      Kennedy and Molly. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>...which means we start back at<br/>square one. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Which square would that be, exactly? 
      <p>GILES<br/>I'm not sure. The First pre-dates<br/>everything we've ever 
      known, or can<br/>know. It's everywhere. It's pure.<br/>I don't know it we 
      can fight it. 
      <p>BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>You're right.</p></p></p></center>
<p>All turn to see: BUFFY, standing in the dining room doorway. Bandaged 
      and broken, but standing all the same. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>We don't know how to fight it. We<br/>don't know when 
      it'll come. Can't<br/>run, can't hide... can't pretend it's<br/>not the end 
      'cause it is. Something<br/>has always been there to try and<br/>destroy the 
      world. We've beaten them<br/>back, but we're not dealing with 
      them<br/>anymore. We're dealing with the<br/>reason they exist. Evil. 
      The<br/>strongest. The First. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy, I know you're tired... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared.<br/>I'm standing on the 
      mouth of Hell and<br/>it's going to swallow me whole.<br/>(beat)<br/>And 
      it'll choke on me.</p></p></center>
<p>There is a fierce resolve creeping into her voice that surprises 
      everyone. She takes a halting step forward. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>We're not ready? THEY'RE not ready.<br/>They 
      think we're gonna wait, like we<br/>always do, for the end to come 
      but<br/>I'm done waiting. They want an<br/>apocalypse? We'll give 'em 
      one.<br/>Anyone else who wants to run do it<br/>now, because we just became 
      an army.<br/>We just declared war.</center>
<p>We push in low on her -- and on everyone, as they are wrapped up in her 
      passionate calm. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>From now on we won't just face our<br/>worst 
      fears, we will seek them out.<br/>We will find them and cut out 
      their<br/>hearts, one by one, until The First<br/>shows itself for what it 
      is. And I<br/>will kill it myself. There's only<br/>one thing on this earth 
      more powerful<br/>than evil. And that's us.</center>
<p>She looks around at them all. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Any questions?</center>
