<p>OVER BLACK: 
      <p>Episode title appears on screen. "<u>Conversations With Dead 
      People</u>." Title fades away. 
      <p>Now, another inscription appears and then fades - "November 12, 2002" 
      <p>And the last inscription - "8:01 pm." 
      <p>Now we FADE UP for a TEASER MONTAGE. 
      <p>EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy wanders the dark cemetery, searching for a particular grave. Is 
      possible, this should be a real cemetery, not styrofoam city. We should 
      get a sense of depth here, with Buffy small and alone amidst the sea of 
      headstones. 
      <p>Buffy stops at a fresh grave. It's the one she's been looking for. She 
      crouches next to it - watching it. 
      <p>Under this scene we hear the sounds of a BAND as they set up and 
      prepare to play. A guitar is tuned... A microphone checked... 
      <p>INT. BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>Now we see the source of the sounds from the previous scene. On stage, 
      a BAND starts to play a mournful tune. It's full of loneliness. Pain. You 
      know, season six stuff. 
      <p>We move slowly from the band, through the crowd, finally resting on 
      SPIKE, who sits by himself. 
      <p>It's clear as we move closer that the music reflects Spike's inner 
      state. He's lost, hurting. 
      <p>MUSIC CONTINUES UNDER: 
      <p>INT. U.C. SUNNYDALE LIBRARY - NIGHT 
      <p>The library is sparsely populated. We find WILLOW alone, studying at a 
      table tucked between the stacks. It's a private, cozy alcove. 
      <p>Willow is hunched over her book, clearly fighting fatigue. After a 
      beat, she gives in and lays her head down on her book. Closes her eyes... 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS HOUSE - ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn comes in the front door. Only a single light is on in the living 
      room. The rest of the house is dark. Dawn moves to the desk in the living 
      room and finds a note with a twenty dollar bill clipped to it. 
      <p>The note reads "Will and I are out until late. Here's money for the 
      store. NOT PIZZA! Love you, Buffy." 
      <p>Dawn takes in the note. Then smiles. Tosses herself onto the couch. A 
      night alone. Cool. 
      <p>EXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
      <p>We find Buffy - still crouching at the fresh grave. Still watching it 
      intently. A beat. Then a HAND SHOOTS OUT OF THE GRAVE. 
      <p>CLOSE ON BUFFY 
      <p>Who takes this in impassively. 
      <p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. JONATHAN'S CAR - NIGHT 
      <p>JONATHAN and ANDREW, both dressed in black, drive in an El Camino along 
      a dark, lonely road. Jonathan's at the wheel. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>You keep circling around -- just <br/>drive straight in. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>Will you shut up? We gotta keep it <br/>low-pro. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Our pro couldn't be any more low. <br/>I'm not even sure this 
      is a <u>road</u>. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>The freeway is a nesting symbol for <br/>John Q. Law. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>That heat's passed, man. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>I'm laying odds our mugs are splashed <br/>across every wire 
      from here to <br/>Appalachia and you want to drive on <br/>the 
      <u>freeway</u>?<br/>(beat)<br/><u>That's just what they want us to do</u>. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>You're just scared... 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>Of course I'm scared! The last time <br/>we were here 
      thirty-three-point-three-<br/>barred percent out us got flayed <br/>alive. 
      And now we're driving right <br/>back into the belly of the beast. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Calm down -- no one's gonna get <br/>flayed alive. We've got a 
      plan. <br/>We're gonna fix all that. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>We should have stayed in Mexico. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Oh, I didn't like it there. Everyone <br/>spoke Mexico-an. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>You could have learned it. You <br/>learned the entire 
      Klingon dictionary <br/>in two and a half weeks. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>That had a much clearer transitive and <br/>intransitive 
      rules.<br/>(beat)<br/>And besides... I can't keep having <br/>those 
      nightmares. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>(haunted)<br/>Right. Me neither.<br/>(pause)<br/><i>"Desde 
      abajo te devora."</i>
<p>ANDREW<br/>"It eats you, starting with your bottom." 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>(to himself)<br/>We're gonna make it right... 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(nodding)<br/>We're outlaws. With hearts of gold. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT. SUNNYDALE ROAD - JONATHAN'S CAR - NIGHT 
      <p>The El Camino drives away, headed for the lights of Sunnydale. 
      <p>EXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
      <p>The VAMPIRE attacks. 
      <p>Buffy fights the vampire (HOLDEN WEBSTER) for a spell. He's her age, 
      not prepossessing but not nerdy either - the kind of guy, with a nice, 
      open face when it's not in vamp mode. Right now it is, and he fights with 
      a ferocity, and some finesse. Should be an easy dispatch for Buffy, but 
      his strength is surprising, and she's not giving it her all. As they 
      continue to fight... 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn stands at the kitchen counter, eating an anchovy and pineapple 
      pizza from a delivery box. 
      <p>She sings a made-up song with her mouth full. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(singing)<br/>Anchovies, anchovies, you're so <br/>delicious 
      / I love you more than all <br/>other fishes...</center>
<p></p>
<p>INT. SUMMERS HOME - BUFFY'S BEDROOM - LATER 
      <p>Dawn stands in front of Buffy's closet, pulling out clothes and holding 
      them up in front of her, admiring. The box of pizza now lies open on 
      Buffy's bed. Dawn holds a piece of pizza in one hand. 
      <p>She realizes she's just got pizza sauce on one of Buffy's tops. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>She'll think it's blood.</center>
<p>She puts the item back in the closet. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER 
      <p>The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE DARKENED ROOM LIKE A STALKER, finding 
      Dawn... 
      <p>Lit by a small lamp that throws a tiny circle of pale light in the dark 
      room, Dawn sits on the floor next to the CD player, drinking soda, 
      listening to music (something youthful and popular), and reading liner 
      notes. She has open CD cases and loose CDs all around her. She spills her 
      soda on some of the CDs and, unconcerned, wipes them with her sleeve. She 
      hears... 
      <p>A SINGLE LOUD THUMP. Is it at the door? She turns down the music... 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Hello?</center>
<p>Nothing. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER 
      <p>We start in blackness, then it becomes clear our POV is from inside 
      Buffy's weapon chest. We get a view looking up at Dawn as she lifts the 
      lid and peers in.</p>
<p>Series of quick shots:</p>
<p>- Dawn tests a knife blade against her thumb. Winces and puts her thumb 
      in her mouth.</p>
<p>- Dawn swings an axe.</p>
<p>
<center>DAWN:<br/>(play-acting)<br/>Taste my blade, spawn of evil!</center>
<p>- Dawn loads a lethal-looking crossbow... using all her strength to 
      pull it back, muscles shaking, an accident waiting to happen. 
      <p>- Dawn sights along the crossbow bolt. 
      <p>- Dawn tugs at the crossbow bolt, which is now embedded in the wall on 
      the other side of the room. She pulls it free, leaving a chunk missing 
      from the wall. 
      <p>- Dawn nudges a plant into place to cover the damage to the wall. 
      <p>EXT / INT. SUMMERS HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE LOOKING IN AT DAWN THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW OR 
      BACK DOOR -- we hear muted music and see Dawn moving around. 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>Now we're inside. 
      <p>The kitchen radio is on, playing Mariachi-style music. Dawn dances a 
      little cha-cha type thing as she puts a single marshmallow into the 
      microwave. 
      <p>This room is also dark -- Dawn's face is lit by the internal light from 
      the microwave. 
      <p>Dawn peeks through the little window at the cooking marshmallow. (if 
      it's possible to actually get a shot into a working microwave we could 
      actually see the marshmallow swell to massive proportions... they do 
      that.) 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Cool.</center>
<p>Another THUMP. Dawn JUMPS and glances toward the back door... no one 
      there. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER 
      <p>CLOSE ON THE TV... a horror movie. A MAN MENACES A WOMAN. 
      <p>ANGLE ON DAWN: On her tummy in front of the television, which is 
      emitting creepy horror-movie music, lit by the TV light and licking 
      marshmallow goo off her fingers as she talks on the cordless phone. She 
      kicks her bare feet in the air behind her.</p>
<p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(into phone re: TV)<br/>Are you seeing this, Kit? She is so 
      <br/>dead, even just talking to this guy. <br/>Oh, he's clearly a 
      psychopath... is <br/>so... what? That is <u>not</u> Tom Hanks. <br/>What 
      are you talking about? <br/>(long beat)<br/>Well what channel are <u>you</u> 
      on?</center>
<p>A SINGLE THUMP. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>There it is again. I keep hearing <br/>this, like, 
      thumping... </center>
<p>Dawn MUTES the television. 
      <p>A single THUMP. 
      <p>Dawn gets up and heads for the door. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>No, I can't tell if it's at the door 
      <br/>or...</center>
<p>Dawn is approaching the door when it FLIES OPEN VIOLENTLY and a blast 
      of wind hits her. No one is there. Dawn closes the door against the wind 
      and stands in front of it. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>(into phone)<br/>Kit? Is there a storm... are you 
      <br/>there? </center>
<p>THE DOOR BLOWS OPEN AGAIN -- MORE INSISTENT, MORE VIOLENT -- this time 
      it hits Dawn, making her drop the phone. 
      <p>Suddenly the TV starts BLARING (horror movie music). The CD player is 
      suddenly on loudly too, and the radio can be heard from the kitchen.</p>
<p>In the cacophony, Dawn runs to the TV and tries to turn it off (at the 
      main unit, not with the remote.) It stays on. She grabs the cord, yanks 
      it... unplugs it. It stays on.</p>
<p>EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT</p>
<p>Buffy and the Vampire are still fighting. They get in the clinch, and 
      he's starting to bear down when he stops, looks at her...</p>
<p>
<center>HOLDEN<br/>Buffy?</center>
<p></p>He takes a step back. Buffy looks equally surprised. 
      <p>
<center>HOLDEN (cont'd)<br/>Buffy Summers? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Uh, have we... 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Webs!<br/>(nothing)<br/>Holden Webster! We were in school 
      <br/>together! European History... I let <br/>you crib off my Vaclev Haval 
      essay <br/>that time... You really don't <br/>remember me? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(no)<br/>Oh, sure, sure... </p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT</p>
<p>The cacophony continues: TV over CD over (o.s.) radio. Dawn stands in 
      the middle of the living room, looking around, confused. (by the way, the 
      plant that she put into place to cover the wall damage is all black and 
      dead now, but we call no special attention to this.) 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>The axe we saw earlier hits the television screen, smashing it. The 
      light and noise from it stops. 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>This time we get to see Dawn swing the axe as it hits the CD player. It 
      gets crushed along with the shelf it rode in on. It stops playing. 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>Dawn, still carrying the axe, enters the kitchen and heads for the 
      kitchen radio, which is still playing Mariachi music. Before she gets 
      there she sees...</p>
<p>The microwave is on, HUMMING LOUDLY, smoke oozing out around the 
      door.</p>
<p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Oh god, oh god...</center>
<p></p>
<p>The HUM GETS LOUDER AND HIGHER... Dawn lunges for it, but doesn't get 
      to it before...</p>
<p>The microwave EXPLODES, the door blasting outwards in fragments of 
      glass.</p>
<p>Dawn yelps and runs for the back door, stepping on glass. On the way, 
      she passes near the radio.</p>
<p>Just for a moment, the Mariachi music dissolves into static and through 
      the static:</p>
<p>
<center>JOYCE (V.O)<br/>Dawn?</center>
<p></p>
<p>Dawn freezes and stares at the radio. It reverts to music.</p>
<p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(soft)<br/>Mom?</center>

      <p>CLOSE ON WILLOW 
      <p>Who still sleeps on her book. But something rouses her. Her eyes 
      flicker open. She sits up, sensing that she's not alone. Then her eyes fix 
      on something. Stop. 
      <p>REVEAL</p>
<p>TARA, sitting on the table, across from her. Willow just takes her in,

      <p>EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
      <p>Holden is still trying to explain who he is. 
      <p>
<center>HOLDEN<br/>Okay. Junior year, spring production <br/>of "Pippen"... 
      I did the lighting <br/>design... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Didn't see it. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>But you helped me move the lighting <br/>board and I dropped 
      it on your foot... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Foot! Yes! Right. And history <br/>class, okay, it's coming 
      back. I'm <br/>sorry.

      part <br/>of your life- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But I just didn't recognize you <br/>'cause you're, you know, a 
      demon, and <br/>I think you've filled out a lot. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Yeah, I got into tai kwon do in a big <br/>way at Dartmouth. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, that's great. So what have you <br/>been up to? 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Well, apparently, dying!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They both laugh.</p>
<p>
<center>HOLDEN<br/>No, but, other stuff, too... Majoring <br/>in psych, 
      really loving that... And <br/>I was taking a year off to do an 
      <br/>internship at the Sunnydale Mental <br/>Hospital. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Wow, that's gotta be a... popular <br/>joint. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Yeah, I keep telling them we should <br/>get a bouncer and a 
      velvet rope. <br/>Hey, you remember Jason Wheeler? <br/>Crazy Jay? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(groan face)<br/>Oh, yeah... 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>He had that shtick, all<br/>(Adam Sandler-esque)<br/>"I'm 
      crazy! I'm crazy!" 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>How is he? 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Crazy. He's been in the chronic ward <br/>since graduation. 
      </p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>It's a bit of a dampener. They smile wanly. 
      <center>
<p>HOLDEN<br/>Not really that funny, I guess. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Ironic, sort of. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Yeah...<br/>(de-morphs)<br/>Whoah! Did my face just change? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. You look human now. You can <br/>go back and forth. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>So I'm a vampire? How weird is that? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm sorry. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>No, it feels okay. Strong, and I <br/>feel like I'm connected 
      to a powerful <br/>all-consuming evil that's gonna suck <br/>the world into 
      fiery oblivion. What <br/>about you? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Not so much connected. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>No, no, but out here, the stake and <br/>the cross - you do 
      this a lot? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, I'm the Slayer, it's sort of a <br/>thing... 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>And you do what, fight vampires? <br/>Professionally? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, I don't get paid, it's more <br/>like a calling. Since... 
      Even in <br/>school. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>I heard a lotta rumors about you back <br/>then. You were all 
      mysterious... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(sorta pleased)<br/>I was? 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Well you were never around. Lotta <br/>kids thought you were 
      dating some <br/>really old guy, or, like heavy <br/>religious. Scott Hope 
      said you were <br/>gay. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What?! I <u>dated</u> that ringworm! 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>He said that about every girl he <br/>broke up with. And then 
      last year, <br/>big surprise, he comes out... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/><u>Men</u>, do I know how to pick 'em. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>So all that time, you were a Slayer. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>"The." 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>"The." Like, the only? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Pretty much. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>So when you said, "not connected," <br/>that was kind of a 
      telling statement. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh, psych 101 alert... 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>I'm just saying- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, what I really need right now is <br/>emotional therapy 
      from the Evil Dead. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Hey, it was your phrase... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm connected. I'm connected to a <br/>lot of people, okay?

<p>INT. SUMMERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
<p>It's later. The lights are on. Dawn is sitting on the living room 
      floor, picking glass out of her foot and wrapping cloth around it. She has 
      the radio on the floor in front of her and the phone to her ear. The axe 
      lies on the floor next to her. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(shaky)<br/>Buffy, come on... pick up... I don't <br/>know

<p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>(to the radio)<br/>Do it again. I heard you! 
      </center>
<p><u>Behind her we get a glimpse of Joyce, dead on the sofa</u>.</p>
<p>Dawn turns that way as if she sensed something there, but the sofa is 
      empty.</p>
<p><u>The lights go out</u>. Pitch black.</p>
<p>They <u>instantly</u> come back on... In the time the lights are on we 
      get a number of quick cuts as Dawn pilots around to see:</p>
<p>- The weapons' chest is on end. 
      <p>- The research table is upside down. 
      <p>- The sofa cushions are piled into a tower. 
      <p>- And the wall is splashed with the bloody words "MOTHER'S MILK IS RED 
      TODAY" 
      <p><u>The lights go out again</u>. In the darkness, we hear Dawn's 
      panicked breathing. Then, we hear a slow, steady, wall-shaking THUMP. 
      <p>THUMP THUMP THUMP -- 
      <p>The lights come back on. Everything is back just like before. No blood, 
      no rearrangement. 
      <p>-- THUMP THUMP THUMP -- 
      <p>Dawn's becoming unhinged. She's breathing hard. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Why are you doing this? </center>
<p>The thumping becomes more insistent, erratic.</p>
<p>THUMP THUMP THUMP. THUMP. THUMPTHUMP THUMP -- </p>
<p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Why are you -- I don't understand. </center>
<p>THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMPTHUMPTHUMP -- </p>
<p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Stop... I don't understand. Stop it. <br/>Stop 
      it... </center>
<p>THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP -- </p>
<p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>(terrified)<br/>STOP IT! </center>
<p>Silence. 
      <p>Dawn looks around, surprised it actually stopped. A beat, then: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Hello? </center>
<p>THUMP. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>(whispered)<br/>Mom? </center>
<p>THUMP. THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP --</p>
<p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Wait -- wait wait wait wait -- I <br/>don't -- 
      </center>
<p>THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP -- 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Slow down -- <br/>(thinks; to herself)<br/>Once for 
      yes... <br/>(to the walls)<br/>Once for yes, twice for no. </center>
<p>Silence. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Mom? </center>
<p>THUMP.</p>
<p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Mom, it's you? </center>
<p>THUMP. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Are you okay? </center>
<p>THUMP. THUMP. 
      <p>Dawn starts breathing harder. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>You're not -- do you need help? </center>
<p>THUMP. 
      <p>The lights dim, brighten. The pictures shake on the walls. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>You need my help. </center>
<p>THUMP. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>What do you want me to do? Should I go get Buffy? 
      </center>
<p>BANG -- some of the light bulbs explode. Dawn cries out. The walls 
      SHAKE, pictures fall. 
      <p>
<p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Stop it. Why are you -- </center>
<p>Then it hits her. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Mom... are you alone? </center>
<p>THUMP. THUMP. 
      <p>Dawn's eyes go wide. 
      <p>THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP -- 
      <p>The house SHAKES violently, rocking on its very foundation. The rest of 
      the lights EXPLODE. Dawn screams. Pitch black. THUMPTHUMPTHUMP -- 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT 
      <p>SPARKS rain down as a miniature buzzsaw cuts a large hole in the window 
      (the one above that Leadership/Followers sign.) The glass is removed from 
      the outside. Two large black backpacks come flying in, followed by a rope, 
      followed by Jonathan. 
      <p>He rappels down. Hits the ground, rights himself. Takes a step forward, 
      looks around. We see the rope in the background (but not the window or the 
      floor.) A beat, then Andrew comes CRASHING DOWN -- sideways -- falling 
      free, somehow missing the rope entirely. 
      <p>He cries out in pain. Jonathan turns around. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN<br/>Oh, get up you wuss. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I have shin splints. </p></center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - LOBBY AREA - NIGHT 
      <p>Jonathan and Andrew walk out into the dimly lit lobby. They're both 
      wearing their backpacks and carrying flashlights. Andrew carries a map. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN<br/>Wow. They really rebuilt it. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>It still smells new. I think. </p></center>
<p>He smells the air, intense concentration on his face. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN<br/>It's weird -- it's a different <br/>building and 
      all...<br/>(looking around)<br/>I mean, on one hand it's totally 
      <br/>different... but it sorta feels <br/>exactly the same... 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>And so big. And empty. </p></center>
<p>Jonathan looks around. Fear begins to creep over him. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>Maybe we could turn a light on or <br/>something. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>They'll see it from the outside. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>Right... </p></p></p></center>
<p>They hear a CREAK. Jonathan jumps. He shines his light in the direction 
      he thought it came from. 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>Maybe we should just go get Buffy. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>No way. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>We'll just tell her what we know <br/>about the Seal of 
      Danzalthar -- 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Think McFly! Why would she believe <br/>us without any proof? 
      We go to her <br/>empty handed and we're cooling our <br/>heels in the clink 
      inside a Bell's <br/>microsecond. </p></p></p></center>
<p>Jonathan considers this. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>I ain't going back to the big house. <br/>That place changes 
      a man. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>That's why we need proof. Think of <br/>it as a trial by fire 
      -- a quest. </p></p></center>
<p>Jonathan gets a romantic look on his face.</p>
<center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/><i>Una questa</i>. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/><u>We</u> find it, <u>we</u> alert the Slayer, <u>we</u>
<br/>help her destroy it, <u>we</u> save <br/>Sunnydale.<br/>(beat)<br/>Then 
      we join her gang and possibly <br/>hang out at her house. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>Right.<br/>(steels himself)<br/>Okay. What do we do? 
</p></p></p></center>
<p>Andrew holds up the map.</p>
<center>
<p>ANDREW<br/>I think we should find the <br/>principal's office and work 
      our way <br/>down from there. </p></center>
<p>Jonathan studies the map, then looks around.</p>
<center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>You look down that hallway, I'll go <br/>check over there. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(nodding)<br/>Check communications. </p></p></center>
<p>They each pull out a walkie-talkie and speak into it.</p>
<center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>Check. Check. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Check. Check. 
      <p>
<table width="60%">

<p>JONATHAN<br/>Check. </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Satisfied, Jonathan nods, walks down the hall. He gets about twenty 
      feet away, then turns back towards Andrew. 
      <p>He speaks into his walkie, even though they're still close enough to 
      hear each other just fine. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>(into walkie)<br/>Echo Two to Echo One. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(into walkie)<br/>This is Echo One. Go ahead. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>(into walkie)<br/>Do you really think they'll let us 
      <br/>join their gang? </p></p></p></center>
<p>Andrew looks at him. Shrugs. Jonathan nods, sad, and then slowly walks 
      around the corner. 
      <p>Andrew watches him go... and doesn't notice WARREN walk up behind him. 
      <p>
<center>WARREN<br/>Nice job. </center>
<p>Andrew does a frightened triple-take. Then he realizes it's Warren. 
      <center>
<p>ANDREW<br/>Where have you been? 
      <p>WARREN<br/>Take it easy, take it easy... 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I'm scared out of my friggin' gourd <br/>here. Do you have any 
      idea how hard <br/>it's been to act this cool? 
      <p>WARREN<br/>Calm down, you're doing great. All <br/>specs are within 
      parameters. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I hate it when you leave me. <br/>(softly)<br/>One time you 
      left me and I ended up <br/>a Mexican. 
      <p>WARREN<br/>We've been over this -- that death <br/>thing was all part of 
      the Master Plan. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I know. But sometimes I don't <br/>understand the Master 
      Plan... 
      <p>WARREN<br/>You of all people should understand <br/>the Master 
      Plan.<br/>(beat)<br/>C'mon -- "If you strike me down..." 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(realizing)<br/>" ...I shall become more powerful <br/>than you 
      could possibly imagine." Of <br/>course!<br/>(thinks)<br/>Do you think maybe 
      Willow could kill <br/>me too? 
      <p>WARREN<br/>Hey, don't worry.<br/>(gestures down hall)<br/>Short Round 
      holds up his end of the <br/>bargain, we'll both become gods. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Andrew looks down the hall after Jonathan. 
      <center>
<p>ANDREW<br/>"That boy is our last hope." </p></center>
<p>Warren immediately goes with it. 
      <center>
<p>WARREN<br/>"No. There is another." </p></center>
<p>Beat. Andrew frowns. 
      <center>
<p>ANDREW<br/>Wait. Really? Who's our other hope? 
      <p>WARREN<br/>No -- I was just going with it. It <br/>was a thing. He's our 
      last hope. </p></p></center>
<p>INT. U.C. SUNNYDALE - LIBRARY 
      <p>Back to Willow's stunned face. Tara still sits across from her, still 
      looking at Willow lovingly. 
      <p>
<center>
<p>TARA<br/>Hey. </p></center>
<p>Willow blinks. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>Hey? 
      <p>TARA<br/>I'm sorry to wake you. </p></p></center>
<p>Willow smiles a little regretfully. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>Ha... 
      <p>TARA<br/>Ha - what? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Is that like a dream joke thing? <br/>You're sorry to wake me, 
      but I'm <br/>clearly <u>not</u> awake and if I was awake <br/>and you really 
      were here, would you <br/>be sorry to wake me up? I mean, after <br/>all 
      this time and - Oh God, I'm <br/>babbling. I'm dream babbling and <br/>it's 
      the best dream of my life and <br/>I'm wasting it and- 
      <p>TARA<br/>(gently)<br/>I just meant, I liked watching you sleep. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh. </p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Now the emotion of it all really penetrates. Dream or not - Tara is 
      near her. Talking to her. Loving her. Willow fights tears. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Oh... Oh God, Tara... </center>
<p>Tara gets emotional as well. 
      <center>
<p>TARA<br/>Shhhh, baby- </p></center>
<p>Willow reaches out to take Tara's outstretched hand, but Tara gently 
      moves it away. Willow looks stricken. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean to- 
      <p>TARA<br/>(regretful)<br/>It's okay. I want you to. But I <br/>don't think 
      I can. Touch. </p></p></center>
<p>Tara shifts on the table, like she's about to stand up. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>Wait! Don't! Don't leave- 
      <p>TARA<br/>I'm not. I was just - my skirt was <br/>bunching up. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh.<br/>(quickly/desperate)<br/>So we'll just sit. We'll sit 
      here. <br/>And if the dream, or possibly ghosty, <br/>rules are no touching, 
      that's fine. <br/>Just don't go. Okay? 
      <p>TARA<br/>Willow- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I think I'm kind of hyperventilating. 
      <p>TARA<br/>Will- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No, it's okay. Just... </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow leans over. Tries to catch her breath. Disappears behind the 
      table. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>(O.C.)<br/>Give me a minute. </p></center>
<p>Tara walks around to her. Willow practically has her head between her 
      knees. Tara kneels and meets her eyes, despite the awkward, crouchy 
      positions. 
      <center>
<p>TARA<br/>Sweetie- </p></center>
<p>Willow is crying now. Like her heart is breaking. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>It hurts so much. I miss you so much. 
      <p>TARA<br/>I know. I know- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I keep telling myself, better to have <br/>loved, right? And 
      lost? Like, at <br/>least we had that. But sometimes I <br/>wish... 
      <p>TARA<br/>It's okay- </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow sits up now. Almost panicky. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>It's not okay! It's so much worse <br/>now. Like, you filled 
      my life up. <br/>You made it bigger. And when you... <br/>The hole you left 
      is so deep. I'm <br/>never going to fill it up. I'm never <br/>going to... 
      <p>TARA<br/>You can. You will. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>How? You're gone. 
      <p>TARA<br/>But you're not. And you're strong. <br/>Like an Amazon, 
      remember? </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow can't help but smile a tiny rueful smile through her tears.</p>
<center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>Big snotty weepy Amazon. 
      <p>TARA<br/>Gotta start somewhere. </p></p></center>
<p>They hold each other's gaze - connecting. 
      <p>INT. BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike sits at the counter, drinking and smoking, lost in lonely 
      thought. An attractive, nice twenty-something GIRL comes up to him, asks 
      to bum a cig. Like all the Spike scenes, we are too far away to hear any 
      dialogue, but the beats play out clearly. He gives her a cig. She 
      indicates the seat next to him. Is it taken? He shrugs. She sits, 
      awkwardly trying to think of something to say. 
      <p>
<center>HOLDEN (V.O.)<br/>You meet someone, you form a bond.</center>
<p>EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy lies on a horizontal crypt (single bed sized) with a stone book 
      open at one end serving as a pillow. Holden sits on a gravestone near her 
      head, listening. It should read as a classic old school psychoanalysis 
      session. 
      <p>
<center>
<p>BUFFY<br/>But they never last. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>You mean <u>all</u> relationships, or just <br/>yours? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, my folks weren't paragons of <br/>stay-togetherness, and 
      maybe that's <br/>a part of... but I think there's people <br/>out there who 
      make it. I just seem <br/>to target the impossible ones. With <br/>deadly 
      accuracy. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>You think you do that on purpose? <br/>Are you maybe 
      protecting yourself? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Protecting myself? From heartbreak, <br/>misery, sexual 
      violence and possible <br/>death, not so much. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>From committing. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(sitting up)<br/>I commit! I'm committed! I'm a 
      <br/><u>committee</u>. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>So it's them. You're reaching out, <br/>they're not coming 
      through. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No... I mean, it's different... <br/>You're confusing me 'cause 
      you're <br/>evil. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>I just think you're in some pain <br/>here. Which I kind of do 
      enjoy <br/>'cause I'm evil now, but I think you <br/>should ease up on 
      yourself. You <br/>don't exactly have the patent on bad <br/>relationships. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Wouldn't it be cool if I did, though? 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>And what, you're supposed to be <br/>settling down already? At 
      twenty? <br/>My girlfriend at college is so <br/>sweet - we have a great 
      thing. <br/>Doesn't mean I wanna go vampify her <br/>so we can be together 
      forever. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Sire. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>What? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The word. When you turn a human into <br/>a vampire. It's, you 
      "sire" them. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Cool. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's a noun too. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>There's a lot of stuff I'm gonna have <br/>to learn here. Come 
      on, how insane <br/>is this? I mean, I was afraid to <br/>talk to you in 
      school, and now we're, <br/>like, mortal enemies. Wouldn't it be <br/>sweet 
      if we became nemeses? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Is that how you say the word? </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She's a little quiet. Holden realizes: 
      <center>
<p>HOLDEN<br/>We're gonna fight to the death here, <br/>aren't we? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's the time-honored custom. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Wow. Reality just shows up <br/>sometimes, doesn't it? But you 
      know, <br/>I got the bloodlust pumpin', I kinda <br/>get it. I'm looking for 
      a fight. <br/>And it's nothing personal... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, no, you've been great. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>And fun catching up. You know, I <br/>really didn't keep in 
      contact with <br/>that many of my friends from high <br/>school.<br/>(evil 
      smile)<br/>Guess I'll be looking up them pretty <br/>soon! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(quiet again)<br/>Yeah. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Okay, I'm really being Count Butt-in-<br/>sky here, but you 
      seem not as <br/>thrilled. Is it 'cause we're gonna <br/>fight? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's 'cause I'm gonna win. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Uh, hello, two years of tai kwan do <br/>plus vampire 
      strength, I think <br/>someone's counting their chickens... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're not leaving this graveyard. <br/>I can't let you. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Do the words 'superiority complex' <br/>mean anything to you? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What, you think I'm gonna let you go <br/>kill a bunch of 
      people? You know I'm <br/>sworn to - 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>No no, I get the battle against evil, <br/>that's not the 
      issue. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>There's no issue. Don't issue me. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Let me ask you this. Who's fault was <br/>your parents' 
      divorce? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay, this is beyond evil. This is <br/>insane troll logic. 
      What do my <br/>parents -- 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>I'm just curious. Your opinion. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, they couldn't get along, they <br/>both had a lot of... 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Top of your head. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>My dad. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Uh huh. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She thinks about it a moment. 
      <center>
<p>BUFFY<br/>He cheated. I'm pretty sure he <br/>cheated. I mean, Mom never 
      said <br/>anything, and, God, Dawn has no idea, <br/>but I think he was... 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>And you never told anyone. None of <br/>your friends. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No point. It was over. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>So. All those relationships of yours <br/>that you knew, 
      subconsciously, were <br/>totally doomed. Whose fault was that? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's incredibly different! 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>I'm just wondering. Is it possible <br/>that just a little 
      bit, you can't <br/>connect with guys because you think <br/>they're not 
      worth it? Maybe you <br/>think you're better than them? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Say! There's that bloodlust I was <br/>looking for! 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Struck a nerve... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm gonna strike a nerve CLUSTER in <br/>a minute, you don't 
      get off this. <br/>You know, I really don't remember you <br/>being this 
      annoying. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>You don't remember me at all. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yes I do... 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Yeah, after, like, thirty minutes of <br/>reminding. And I 
      really don't take <br/>it personally, 'cause you clearly <br/>were in your 
      own world in high <br/>school, all Chosen, all Destiny.... <br/>who could 
      live like that for seven <br/>years and NOT feel superior? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm not. God, if anything... 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>What? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm really... if you knew what I've <br/>done, what I've let 
      myself become... </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She's getting a little emotional here... 
      <center>
<p>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>My best friends don't even -- you'd <br/>laugh, you 
      heard some of the things <br/>I've done to them. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>(sincerely)<br/>I'm here to kill you, Buffy, not to <br/>judge 
      you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The relationships, I know it's not <br/>their fault. I'm not 
      really sure how <br/>they put up with me. The last guy I <br/>was with, it 
      got really... I behaved <br/>like a monster. Treated him like... <br/>and at 
      the same time I let him just <br/>take me over, do things to me that... 
      <br/>if anyone knew what really went on <br/>between us, they'd never look 
      at me <br/>again. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>I think they would. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You don't know. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>And you don't either... 'til you tell <br/>someone. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I couldn't... </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She's fighting back tears... 
      <center>
<p>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Oh god, I'm so sorry... I didn't mean <br/>to get all 
      true confessions, I don't <br/>know what's wrong with me... 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>There's nothing wrong with you. </p></p></center>
<p>He swings a small statue of the Virgin Mary into her face, sends her 
      flying back. She lands on her back, dazed, and he lands on her, vamped 
      out. 
      <center>
<p>HOLDEN (cont'd)<br/>Everyone's got issues. </p></center>
<p>He bites.

      <p>Buffy pushes Holden off her, slams him with a punch and away they go. 
      Fighty McFightenstein. After a few blows: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You son of a bitch. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>What? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I think I'm gonna kill you just a <br/>little bit more than 
      usual. </p></p></center>
<p>More blows. 
      <center>
<p>HOLDEN<br/>Hey, we had a moment, you opened up, <br/>it was sweet and it 
      made me wanna <br/>bite you. I'm sorry if I overstepped <br/>bounds... I'm 
      new at this mortal <br/>enemy stuff. </p></center>
<p>He kicks her, high, again catching her a bit off guard. 
      <center>
<p>HOLDEN (cont'd)<br/>Pretty fast learner, though. </p></center>
<p>She plows into him and they head towards a crypt, go crashing through 
      the stained glass window -- 
      <p>INT. CRYPT - NIGHT 
      <p>-- and land in a shower of glass and noise, locked in struggle -- 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Very dark. The only light is the moonlight from outside. Dawn is just a 
      tense dark shape in the middle of the room. We HEAR HER BREATHING. 
      <p>Then we hear SOMETHING ELSE BREATHING... out of sync with her, slower, 
      deeper, with a hint of a SNARL TO IT on the inhale, like the breathing of 
      a wild animal. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>I hear you. The thing that's <br/>breathing? I hear you 
      breathing. </center>
<p>More breathing. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Are you hurting my mother? Are you <br/>keeping her from 
      coming back to me? </center>
<p>There is a sudden FLASH OF LIGHT, just fast enough for our eyes to 
      register that JOYCE IS ON THE COUCH again, lying there in the position 
      where Buffy found the body. 
      <p>Joyce looks as dead and corpsy as she did that night, only her head is 
      up, her eyes are open and they're looking right at Dawn. The eyes are 
      blank white. 
      <p>And then the light is gone from the room. 
      <p>In the darkness again, Dawn gasps. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Mom. I... I see you. I'm coming <br/>toward you, 
      okay?</center>
<p>Dawn takes a little shuffly step toward the sofa in the dark, and 
      another. 
      <p>Another momentary FLASH OF LIGHT and we see that something big and dark 
      is hunched over Joyce, pressing her into the sofa. (I'm thinking <u>the 
      Gnarl suit, painted black, and seen only from the back</u> for less than a 
      second.) 
      <p>Joyce's face is visible behind it... her mouth is stretched into a 
      silent scream and her hand is reaching out imploringly toward Dawn. Her 
      eyes are still blank. 
      <p>The Flash ends. Blackness. 
      <p>Dawn stands motionless in the dark. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>She's trying to talk to me. My <br/>mother has 
      something to tell me. <br/>(louder, stronger)<br/>Get off her and let her 
      talk to me!</center>
<p>Dawn gropes for something on the floor. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>(to herself)<br/>The axe...</center>
<p>A THIRD FLASH OF LIGHT. Dawn's POV, the axe swinging right at her head 
      (we can't see who's swinging it.) She SCREAMS AND DUCKS. 
      <p>She runs for the front door, RIPS IT OPEN. But then she freezes in the 
      doorway. 
      <p>On Dawn's back, we hear: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>No. </center>
<p>She turns toward us, back into the room. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>(soft, calm, determined)<br/>She's my mother. I'm 
      staying. </center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
      <p>Jonathan and Andrew walk through the dark, creepy hallways of the 
      basement. Andrew tries to make heads or tails of his map and compass. 
      <center>
<p>ANDREW<br/>You know, you could help me here. <br/>Orienteering is best 
      suited for two <br/>adults -- one to calibrate the <br/>compass, the other 
      to survey the -- 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>(looking around)<br/>This basement's enormous. Is the 
      <br/>high school this big? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I hate it down here. It's all dank <br/>and barren. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>(touched)<br/>Awww -- like Empress Josephine. </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Andrew's becoming unhinged. 
      <center>
<p>ANDREW<br/>This doesn't make any sense...<br/>(looking around)<br/>Where 
      did you go... 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>Dude, I'm right here. Pull yourself <br/>toget -- </p></p></center>
<p>BOOM. A loud thump echoes from elsewhere in the basement. The boys grab 
      each other in fright. 
      <center>
<p>ANDREW<br/>What was that? 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>I don't know -- 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Maybe we should go upstairs. For a <br/>little bit. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>Yeah... </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They hear some CREAKING. 
      <center>
<p>ANDREW<br/>(genuinely scared)<br/>Or maybe you're right. Maybe we 
      <br/>should go get Buffy... 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>(nodding)<br/>Yeah... 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>She could... help us... </p></p></p></center>
<p>Jonathan thinks about this. Makes a decision. He lets go of Andrew. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>No.<br/>(to himself)<br/><i>Esto es la 
      questa</i>.<br/>(pause)<br/><i>La questa... para redempcion</i>. </p></center>
<p>He walks forward. Strength in his step. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>C'mon. </p></center>
<p>Andrew doesn't move. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/><u>C'mon</u>. </p></center>
<p>Andrew and Jonathan walk around another corner. Andrew is becoming 
      noticeably more anxious. Jonathan is calm. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>I wonder what the new cafeteria is <br/>like? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(studying map)<br/>Why do you care? These walls aren't 
      <br/>supposed to be here. This is wrong... 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>I don't know. Seeing the high school <br/>again... part of 
      me wishes I could go <br/>back. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Everything's shifting around. I feel <br/>like we're in 
      <u>Hellraiser</u>.<br/>(looking around, scared)<br/>I hate Pinhead. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>Let me see that. </p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He takes the map. They keep walking. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>Have we circled all the way around? </p></center>
<p>They walk around another corner... 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>Maybe we should start over, go back <br/>to -- 
      </p></center>
<p>Andrew looks up. At the far end of the hall, standing in the middle of 
      a side room, is Warren. He stares at Andrew. 
      <center>
<p>ANDREW<br/>There it is... </p></center>
<p>Jonathan looks up. His POV -- we see only the room at the end of the 
      hall. No Warren. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>What? Are you sure? </p></center>
<p>Andrew's POV -- Warren, staring. 
      <center>
<p>ANDREW<br/>(swallows)<br/>Yeah. </p></center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 
      <p>Andrew and Jonathan enter (Warren can't be seen.) The room is old, 
      dark, and creepy. It looks like it's been here for quite some time. It has 
      one of those old, hard clay floors. Jonathan consults the map. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>You know, I think you may be right. </p></center>
<p>Andrew tosses his pack on the ground. He pulls out a pick-axe (which 
      should be easily accessible.) 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>If this lines up, what we'd be looking for 
      should<br/>be right -- </p></center>
<p>He looks at Andrew, who's ready to dig. He looks at the ground between 
      them. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>Under there. </p></center>
<p>Andrew swings the pick axe. Just as it breaks the floor, we CUT TO: 
      <p>INT. CRYPT - NIGHT 
      <p>Mid fight. Buffy gets Holden on the ground, whips out a stake, holds it 
      up high... 
      <center>
<p>BUFFY<br/>(breathing hard, pissed)<br/>See? You're dead? That enough of a 
      <br/>moment for you? 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>(de-morphs)<br/>Okay, but are you killing me because <br/>I'm 
      evil, or because you opened up? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>GNAARRRRGH!!!! </p></p></p></center>
<p>She gets up, not killing him. Pacing with anger and emotion, she 
      circles back and kicks him in the head really hard as he's lying there. 
      Walks away again as he rises, winded. 
      <center>
<p>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>What is wrong with you? 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Nothing. I got no worries; I'm dead. <br/>Biggest thing on my 
      mind is whether <br/>Julie Waldman came to my funeral or <br/>not. You 
      remember her? OH bite-able. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>See, this is what I hate about you <br/>vampires. Sex and death 
      and pain and <br/>love, it's all, the same damn thing <br/>to you. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Well, in a way, that's a guy thing; <br/>you know, we talk 
      about 'nailing' a <br/>girl, there's a lot of sub -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's not the same. With vampires, <br/>it's completely... 
      believe me, I know. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Oh my god. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh your god what? 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Well, not MY god, 'cause I defy him <br/>and all his works -- 
      does he exist, <br/>by the way? Is there word on that? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Nothing solid. 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>I'm getting off topic 'cause my <br/>mind's racing here, but 
      I'll make you <br/>a deal. We fight. To the death, <br/>great -- that last 
      fight was just <br/>exhilarating and I actually had a <br/>move coming up to 
      block the stake, <br/>but you have to answer one question. <br/>If I'm 
      right; then I'm allowed to ask <br/>anything. No secrets, no defensiveness, 
      <br/>you tell me anything I wanna know. And <br/>we call a truce 'til I'm 
      satisfied. <br/>After that, good old-fashioned <br/>gentlemen's duel. No 
      sudden attacks. <br/>If you tell me the truth. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>A beat as Buffy considers it. 
      <center>
<p>BUFFY<br/>What's your question? 
      <p>HOLDEN<br/>Your last relationship. Was it with <br/>a vampire? </p></p></center>
<p>Off her look: 
      <p>EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike is walking that same girl home. Again, they are far away, and 
      there are people and cars between us and them, so we don't hear them, but 
      they seem to be getting along. There's a sweetness to the way they are 
      together, both talking, laughing a bit... 
      <p>INT. U.C. SUNNYDALE LIBRARY - NIGHT 
      <p>We're back with Willow and Tara, who continue their conversation where 
      they left off. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>I don't know... I don't know where <br/>to start.<br/>(with 
      difficulty)<br/>Tara. After Warren shot you. I had <br/>a very... dramatic 
      reaction. I <br/>killed him. I mean, really, really <br/>killed him. And 
      then... 
      <p>TARA<br/>I know. And I know what you tried to <br/>do. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You do? There's gossip where you are? 
      <p>TARA<br/>It's not like that. I just know. </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow nods. Accepts this. Then- 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>It was horrible. <u>I</u> was horrible. I <br/>lost myself. 
      The regular me. 
      <p>TARA<br/>You were grieving- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>A lot of people grieve. They don't <br/>make with the 
      flaying.<br/>(scared)<br/>I hurt so many people. All my <br/>friends. Buffy, 
      Xander, Giles... I <br/>didn't care. I wanted to erase them <br/>all. I 
      wanted to erase the whole <br/>world. 
      <p>TARA<br/>It wasn't you. It was the power. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>But I <u>am</u> the power. It's in me.<br/>(quickly)<br/>Did I 
      mention random destruction of <br/>property? The magic box is... not so 
      <br/>much a box now- 
      <p>TARA<br/>(ignoring)<br/>The power is bigger than you, that's <br/>what I 
      always tried to tell you. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I know. You were right- 
      <p>TARA<br/>You just have to stop. You can't use magic <br/>again. Not ever. 

      <p>WILLOW<br/>(confused) <br/>Black magic. Of course. But Giles <br/>says it 
      isn't as simple as quitting <br/>it all cold turkey. He says I have <br/>to 
      learn to use my power for good. <br/>The magic is in me now, and if I try 
      <br/>to repress it, it's going to end <br/>up coming out again - in a bad 
      way. 
      <p>TARA<br/>(shakes her head)<br/>It's too dangerous. You can't take <br/>the 
      chance that you'll lose control. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't want to. I can't. But the <br/>stuff Giles and the 
      coven taught me <br/>in England - it helped.<br/>(then)<br/>And, you know, 
      all I have to do is <br/>think of the look on Dawnie's face - <br/>when I 
      tried to... When I said such <br/>awful things to her. I never want to 
      <br/>see that look again. I never want to <br/>cause that kind of pain. 
      <p>TARA<br/>I know you don't. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(hopeful) <br/>So I won't. I'm going to be okay. 
      <p>TARA<br/>(gently) <br/>Oh, baby. You're not listening. <br/>Don't you 
      understand?<br/>You're not going to be okay. You're <br/>going to kill 
      everybody. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>

      <p>Buffy and Holden are talking. It's very casual, almost intimate, as 
      they sit in the corner. Buffy is really opening up. 
      <center>
<p>BUFFY<br/>I'm afraid. I'm afraid of falling <br/>back into the way I was 
      last year. <br/>I thought I was nothing. I have so <br/>much power, I didn't 
      ask for it, I <br/>don't deserve it... sometimes I <br/>think... I think the 
      relationship I <br/>had last year was... like I wanted to <br/>be punished. 
      I wanted to hurt like <br/>I thought I deserved to. 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>Wow. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And the joke is, he loved me. In his <br/>own sick, soulless 
      way, he really did <br/>care for me. But I didn't want to be <br/>loved. 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>Didn't you? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I just wanted to be touched. To be <br/>reached. Were you here 
      when <br/>everything turned into a musical? 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>I missed it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I explained it a lot better then. <br/>With rhyme, and all, but 
      I just... I <br/>can't go back to that. 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>And you think you might? You're <br/>still attracted to this 
      guy? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, he's changed, a lot, a LOT a <br/>lot, but no, I... I 
      just can't feel <br/>as low as I did then and do what I <br/>have to do. 
      Things are getting <br/>worse. More of you guys are rising, <br/>and... 
      something's coming. 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>Yeah, I feel that. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I have to fight it and the truth is, <br/>I don't have any more 
      answers than I <br/>did then. There's so many people to <br/>protect... 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>And you have to do that alone. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I have friends, they do it with me -- <br/>sometimes they do it 
      in spite of me, <br/>but they do it 'cause they're decent <br/>people. I do 
      it 'cause I was chosen. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She looks at him, understanding a bit better. 
      <center>
<p>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I sort of think... this is <br/>complicated and if 
      you'd rather just <br/>fight... 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>Tell me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I feel like I'm worse than anyone, <br/>honestly, I'm beneath 
      them. My <br/>friends, my boyfriends, I feel like <br/>I'm not worthy of 
      their love 'cause <br/>even though they love me it doesn't <br/>really mean 
      anything because their <br/>opinions don't matter. They don't <br/>know. 
      They haven't been through what <br/>I've been through, they're not the 
      <br/>Slayer... I am. And sometimes I <br/>feel... this is what's so awful. 
      <br/>(beat)<br/>I feel like I'm better than them. <br/>Superior. </p></p></p></center>
<p>A beat as he takes this in. 
      <center>
<p>HOLDEN <br/>(smiles)<br/>So you can't win. </p></center>
<p>She looks down as he smiles kindly. 
      <center>
<p>HOLDEN (cont'd)<br/>And I thought I was diabolical. Or, <br/>I plan to 
      be. You do have a <br/>superiority complex, and you've got <br/>an 
      inferiority complex about it. <br/>Kudos. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It doesn't make any sense. 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>It makes every kind of sense. It <br/>just adds up to you 
      feeling alone. <br/>And, Buffy... everybody feels alone. <br/>Everybody is, 
      'til they die.<br/>(rising)<br/>Speaking of... You ready for our <br/>little 
      death match? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I suppose. Thanks for listening. </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They go to their corners, preparing. 
      <center>
<p>HOLDEN <br/>There's some things you can only tell <br/>a stranger. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're not a stranger. But that <br/>stuff with Spike is pretty 
      -- 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>Hold it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What? 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>Did you say Spike? </p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DOORSTEP - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike and the girl, as she gets out her keys, clearly indicating he can 
      come up if he wants to. He takes a step back, reluctant... 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 
      <p>Andrew and Jonathan have made considerable progress excavating the room 
      (we'll see the full extent in a bit.) They've also set up a few work 
      lights (but not so many that we lose creepiness.) 
      <p>The boys are busy digging. They're tired, sweaty, but in relatively 
      good spirits. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>"You said the headpiece only had <br/>markings on one side. 
      Are you <br/>absolutely sure?" </p></center>
<p>Andrew thinks about this very hard. He nods. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>"Belloq's staff is too long..."</p></center>
<p>
<center>
<table width="60%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="middle"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>"They're 
            digging in the <br/>wrong place!" </font></td>
<td align="middle"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>"They're 
            digging in the <br/>wrong place!" 
</font></td></tr></tbody></table></center>
<p>They laugh. Cool. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>We've almost got this thing uncovered. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Yep. 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>I hope Buffy'll have some idea of how <br/>to destroy -- 
      <br/>(realizing something)<br/>Thirty-six, nineteen, twenty-seven! 
      <br/>That's it! That was my locker <br/>combination. That's been bugging me 
      <br/>all night... 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Dude, we've spent the last few years <br/>trying to forget 
      high school. Why <br/>are you trying so hard to remember it? 
      <p>JONATHAN<br/>I don't know... I guess I miss it. <br/>Don't you? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(sarcastic)<br/>Yeah, I really miss it. You know, I <br/>don't 
      think they even knew my name <br/>back then. </p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Jonathan stops digging, leans on his shovel. 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN<br/>I'm serious. I really miss it. Time <br/>goes by -- 
      everything drops away. <br/>All the cruelty, all the pain, all <br/>the 
      humiliation. It all washes away. </p></center>
<p>ANDREW'S POV. Warren is standing there, staring at Andrew and listening 
      intently. 
      <p>ANGLE: JONATHAN 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>I miss my friends. I miss my <br/>enemies. I miss 
      the people I talked <br/>to every day. And I miss the people <br/>who never 
      knew I existed. I miss 'em <br/>all. </p></center>
<p>ANDREW'S POV again. He glances up at Warren. Warren stares directly at 
      him. 
      <p>ANGLE: JONATHAN (and we don't see Warren again for the rest of the 
      scene) 
      <center>
<p>JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>I want to talk to them. You know? <br/>I wanna find 
      out how they're doing. <br/>I want to know what's going on in <br/>their 
      lives. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Yeah? Well, you know what? They <br/>don't want to talk to 
      you. All those <br/>people you just mentioned -- not one <br/>of them's 
      sitting around going, "I <br/>wonder what Jonathan's up to right <br/>now?" 
      Not one of them cares about <br/>you. </p></p></center>
<p>Jonathan thinks about this for a while. A peacefulness washes over him. 
      He shrugs. There's an almost Zen-like clarity about him when he says: 
      <p>
<center>JONATHAN<br/>Well I still care about them. <br/>(softly)<br/>That's 
      why I'm here. </center>
<p>Andrew shakes his head: you're crazy. Jonathan goes back to digging. 
      <p>And we crane up and finally get a good look at what they're uncovering: 

      <p>The Seal of Danzalthar. A large, intricate metal SEAL -- not unlike a 
      Presidential seal, if the President was Satan. It's about six feet in 
      diameter, with a big evil ornate symbol carved into it. 
      <p>It was buried almost two feet underground, and the boys have uncovered 
      almost all of it. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn is huddled in a corner. Her clothes are torn, her face and body 
      are bloodied -- more LASH MARKS ALL OVER HER. 
      <p>The wind is howling and whipping everything around the room. 
      <p>She has been chanting over this noise for a long time. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(shouting hoarsely)<br/>I cast you out with every prayer 
      from <br/>every god that walks the earth or <br/>crawls beneath. </center>
<p>She flings more potion. 
      <p>ANOTHER SCREAM, MORE ANGUISHED. 
      <p>Something unseen GRABS DAWN'S HEAD AND SLAMS IT BACK INTO WALL, OVER 
      AND OVER, as she continues: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>I cast you out with the strength of <br/>those who 
      love me. I cast you out <br/>with the strength I have inside me-- </center>
<p>DAWN SPITS BLOOD FROM HER MOUTH... 
      <p>The WIND BLOWS LOUDER! 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>(shouting, the big <br/>finish)<br/>And I cast you 
      out into the void! </center>
<p>And she THROWS the entire container of potion. 
      <p>WE HEAR HORRIBLE DEATH NOISES. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>That's right! Die, you bastard! </center>
<p>THE WALLS ARE SUDDENLY SPLASHED, EXLODED-ONTO WITH BLOOD, THICK CLOTS 
      OF IT UP TO HEAD-HIGH. THEN IT VANISHES, SUCKED AWAY, AS THE DEATH-SCREAMS 
      RATTLE AWAY TO NOTHING. 
      <p>And it is QUIET. The wind has stopped. Everything stops blowing around. 

      <p>Dawn, realizing she's won, collapses to the ground. 
      <p>The LIGHT CHANGES... suddenly there's a golden glow. Dawn looks up, 
      blinking into the light. We see that Dawn's wounds have healed, but her 
      hair is tangled, her face is wet with tears and streaked with blood. 
      <p>DAWN'S POV: IT'S JOYCE... 
      <p>She's ethereal, glowing from the inside, translucent even. She's 
      wearing something flowy and white. 
      <p>Dawn starts to cry and shake with the relief of everything. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>(a whisper)<br/>Mom. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Things are coming, Dawn. Listen. <br/>Things are on their way. 
      I love you. <br/>And I love Buffy. But she will not <br/>be there for you. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What? What are you-- 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>There will be choosing to be done. <br/>And when it is very 
      bad, Buffy will <br/>not choose you. She will be against <br/>you. </p></p></p></center>
<p>Joyce is FADING AWAY, leaving Dawn in darkness. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>No! Don't go! God! <u>Don't go</u>! </center>
<p>But Joyce is gone. 
      <p>BIG WIDE SHOT OF DAWN on the ground, rumpled and tangle-haired, 
      tear-and-blood-streaked, in the dark and devastated room - broken TV, 
      smashed CD player, broken lamp, broken windows, and a big heap of 
      disturbing advice. 
      <p>INT. U.C. SUNNYDALE LIBRARY - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow still looks completely stunned. The way you would if your dead 
      lover just told you you were going to kill everybody. Tara looks regretful 
      - she hates to be the bearer of such tragic information. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>I'm going to... what? 
      <p>TARA<br/>It's why I came. I needed to warn <br/>you. </p></p></center>
<p>Willow starts to grow increasingly agitated and tearful. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>How do you know? What do you know? 
      <p>TARA<br/>(grimly)<br/>You don't want to know what I saw. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh God... 
      <p>TARA<br/>But if you stop. Completely. No <br/>more magic- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Right. Right. Stop. <br/>(then)<br/>But what about Giles? He 
      made it <br/>seem like it would be just as <br/>dangerous for me to quit 
      completely. <br/>Like I'll go off the deep end again. 
      <p>TARA<br/>You can't. Willow, if you do so much <br/>as another spell... 
      </p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow is in a full blown panic now. Tara also looks scared. The fate 
      of the world hangs in the balance. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>I tried to stop. I tried. What if <br/>I can't do this? 
      <p>TARA<br/>Don't think that way- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>How can I <u>not</u>? You're telling me I'm <br/>going to 
      murder all my friends!<br/>(desperate)<br/>I'm not strong, Tara. I'm not an 
      <br/>Amazon. I'm just me. Look what I <br/>did before... </p></p></p></center>
<p>Tara thinks... A horrible beat. Then- 
      <center>
<p>TARA<br/>There is one thing. One thing you <br/>could do to stop it. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What? Anything. 
      <p>TARA<br/>You could sleep. </p></p></p></center>
<p>A beat as Willow comprehends what Tara is saying. 
      <p>Her expression shifts. Distrust and anger darken her features. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>Who are you? </p></center>
<p>INT. CRYPT - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and Holden are pretty much where we left them. 
      <center>
<p>BUFFY<br/>What do you mean? You know Spike? <br/>How? 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>What do you mean, how? He's the guy <br/>that... what was the 
      word again? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(color draining)<br/>Sired. 
      <p>HOLDEN <br/>Yeah. He's the guy that sired me. </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DOORSTEP - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike is massively biting the girl, blood dripping down her neck as he 
      feeds, vamp-faced and ravenous. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 
      <p>The boys have completely uncovered the Seal. Jonathan happily packs up 
      his backpack, eager to go tell Buffy. 
      <p>A shadow falls over him. He turns around, sees Andrew, looking solemn. 
      And further back, behind Andrew, he sees Warren. 
      <p>This has barely time to register on Jonathan's face before... 
      <p>Andrew STABS him, plunging a large ceremonial dagger deep into 
      Jonathan's stomach. Shock, pain on Jonathan's face. 
      <p>INT. U.C. SUNNYDALE LIBRARY - NIGHT 
      <p>Now Willow and Tara (who is really The First, natch') face off. 
      <center>
<p>TARA/FIRST <br/>The suicide thing was too far, huh? <br/>Huh. You seemed 
      so ripe. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Tell me who you are. 
      <p>TARA/FIRST <br/>I stand by my opinion, you know. The <br/>world would be 
      better off if you took <br/>a razor blade to your wrists- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Stop- 
      <p>TARA/FIRST <br/>You know to cut long, right? Up the <br/>arm. I can see 
      it now, candle <br/>light... The Indigo Girls playing. <br/>A picture of 
      your dead girlfriend on <br/>your bloody lap- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Stop. Stop using Tara this way- 
      <p>TARA/FIRST <br/>(mocking)<br/>Ohhh! You left a big hole! It hurts <br/>so 
      much! </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Now Tara/First moves in on Willow, seething with malevolence. 
      <center>
<p>TARA/FIRST (cont'd)<br/>You don't know hurt. This last year, <br/>it's 
      going to seem like cake after <br/>what I put you and your friends 
      <br/>through. I'm not a big fan of easy <br/>death... Fact is, the whole 
      "good <br/>and evil, balancing the scales"<br/>thing? I'm over it. I'm done 
      with <br/>the mortal coil. But, believe me, <br/>I'm going for a big finish. 
      </p></center>
<p>Willow is chilled to the bone. 
      <center>
<p>WILLOW<br/>From beneath you it devours. 
      <p>TARA/FIRST <br/>Not it. Me. </p></p></center>
<p>With that, Tara/First smiles... And her smile stretches wider and wider 
      until it becomes grotesque, like a macabre horror mask (CGI). The smile 
      engulfs the entire face as the rest of TARA'S BODY seems to get sucked in 
      by it. In an instant - The First is gone. 
      <p>Off Willow, shaking and terrified. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn sits, confused and upset by her mother's message. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 
      <p>OVERHEAD SHOT 
      <p>Jonathan's body collapses on the ground, his head and upper body 
      landing on top of the Seal. He's facing up -- his lifeless eyes stare up 
      at us. 
      <p>A beat, then a pool of blood comes GUSHING out from under his shoulders 
      and head, filling the crevasses of the Seal. 
      <p>We slowly PULL up, away, and as the symbol fills up with blood it 
      begins to ILLUMINATE. 
      <p>EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DOORSTEP - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike rears back with a bloody mouth as the girl's body drops to the 
      ground. 
      <p>INT. CRYPT - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy stands amidst the crumbling skeleton of a falling Holden, 
      disbelief and pain on her face. 
      <p>BLACK OUT. 
      <p>
<center><u>END OF SHOW</u></center>
