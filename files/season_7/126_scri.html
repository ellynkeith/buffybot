<div align="right">FADE IN:</div>INT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT 
      <p>TIGHT on a WOMAN'S FEET clad in black pumps. Her toes point to the 
      ceiling. The CAMERA PANS up her body. Over this, we hear MORTICIAN #1 and 
      MORTICIAN #2. 
      <p>
<center>MORTICIAN #1 (O.S.)<br/>She looks so peaceful.</center>
<p>The CAMERA reaches the woman's neck, which is covered with thick 
      make-up. And then her face: She is a sweet older woman with a faint smile 
      on her lips. PULL BACK to REVEAL she's in a plush coffin. 
      <p>
<center>MORTICIAN #2 (O.S.)<br/>She does, doesn't she? So the 
      family<br/>gets here at ten in the morning. 
      <p>MORTICIAN #1 (O.S.)<br/>Want me to bring coffee?</p></center>
<p>PULLING BACK reveals more of the room: Comfortable decorations, nice 
      wallpaper, etc. In the corner, two full- size coffins and one child's 
      coffin. The LIGHTS ARE TURNED OFF before the morticians are in our scope. 
      It's dark. 
      <p>
<center>MORTICIAN #2 (O.S.)<br/>Can you make mine a Chai latte?</center>
<p>We HEAR the door close and lock. Everything is still. Dark. 
      <p>Suddenly, one of the coffins CREAKS OPEN. The lid falls back and a 
      SHADOWY FIGURE steps stealthily out of the coffin. And then a second 
      CREAK! Another coffin opens. Another OBSCURE FIGURE emerges and flicks on 
      a FLASHLIGHT, shines it right at: XANDER. Who covers his eyes. He's 
      irritable. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Hey!</center>
<p>BUFFY, holding the flashlight, moves the beam. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Sorry.</center>
<p>A KNOCKING. Buffy's beam finds the noise: coming from the child's 
      coffin. Xander lifts the lid, revealing a squashed DAWN, who climbs out, 
      looking crabby. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>I think that thing had a 
      child-lock.<br/>(stretching)<br/>I'm all cricky. You know, I'm not<br/>the 
      shortest one here. I don't know<br/>why I was in the kid coffin for-- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(re: his watch; sour)<br/>Thirty-three minutes. Since when 
      did<br/>we go to all this effort for one<br/>lousy vampire, make that one 
      lousy<br/><u>potential</u> vampire? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(quiet and serious)<br/>Vampire by vampire. It's the 
      only<br/>way I know how. Look, I know it's my<br/>job and not yours-- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>No, no, I'm sorry. I want to help.<br/>I guess I'm a bit 
      stressed out these<br/>days. Sorry to take it out on you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No big. I'm kinda stressed myself. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Well, the whole Willow sitch is not<br/>unstressifying. She's 
      here. But not<br/>here, "part of the gang" here.<br/>(then)<br/>And hopefully 
      not here, "under my<br/>feet 'cause she's in another time-<br/>dimension" 
      here.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Surreptitiously, she checks the bottom of her sneakers. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>There's Willow, there's the looming<br/>humongo bad, and.. 
      it's a school<br/>night. I should be home in bed,<br/>cuddling up to my 
      insomnia and<br/>worrying how I'm going to mess up<br/>tomorrow.</center>
<p>As they make their way towards the open casket: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>You'll do fine. You'll be a great<br/>counselor. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But this week is going to be my first<br/>time really talking 
      to kids. What if<br/>their problems are all weird and<br/>tricky? What if I 
      can't help them? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I think you underestimate your<br/>familiarity with the world 
      of weird<br/>and tricky. You're perfect for this<br/>job. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, right. Check out perfect me<br/>taking my sister on a 
      fun,<br/>educational outing to the--</p></p></p></center>
<p>As all three look at the Dead Woman in her coffin. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Dead body. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I dunno, amateur opinion here, but<br/>she looks dead. I mean, 
      like natural<br/>causes dead. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The paper said she had unusual cuts<br/>and contusions on her 
      neck.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks closer at the dead neck. Reaches out and tentatively 
      touches the TINY STITCHES on the body's neck. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Maybe she cut herself shaving. And<br/>then died, 
      naturally, of<br/>embarrassment.</center>
<p>BUFFY'S POV: The Dead Woman's face. So placid. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (O.S.)<br/>She looks -- 
      <p>BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>Peaceful.</p></center>
<p>A beat. And suddenly, the woman's EYES POP OPEN! 
      <p>The VAMPIRE WOMAN grabs Buffy's hands in hers, pulls her close. Her 
      pale eyes intense. 
      <p>
<center>VAMPIRE WOMAN<br/>I. Am. Not. Peaceful.</center>
<p>Buffy struggles, eager to get the stake from her belt. But the Vamp 
      Woman clings no her desperately. In the struggle, the flashlight drops. 
      <p>Xander grabs the flashlight from the floor and CLOCKS THE VAMP OVER THE 
      HEAD. The Vamp releases her grasp. 
      <p>Buffy snags the stake and, in one swift motion, stakes her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/><u>That</u> I can help with.</center>
<p>DUST! The coffin is empty. Buffy holsters her stake and lowers the 
      coffin lid. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I always thought closed caskets were<br/>more 
      tasteful anyway.</center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S OPFICE - DAY 
      <p>Buffy sits at her desk. [She's in <u>outfit #1</u> of this montage] She 
      checks the coffee can of freshly sharpened pencils. She straightens the 
      papers on her desk. Looks up. No kids yet. Checks the pencils again. She's 
      ready. Nervous, but ready. 
      <p>Then AMANDA, a shy girl, pokes her head into Buffy's cubicle. 
      <p>
<center>AMANDA<br/>Hello? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(too loudly)<br/>Come in!</p></center>
<p>Buffy stands; then sits; smiles real big. Amanda just looks at Buffy, 
      wary of her enthusiasm. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Hi!</center>
<p>Tentatively, Amanda makes her way to the chair and sits down. She looks 
      up at Buffy, her eyes as pitiful as a hound dog's. 
      <p>
<center>AMANDA<br/>Mr. Miller sent me here. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Do you know why? 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>I'm not sure.<br/>(then)<br/>Maybe 'cause this guy was picking 
      on<br/>me.</p></p></center>
<p>Off BUFFY'S sympathetic expression: 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>A new kid, MATTHEW, cute but grim, sits facing BUFFY. He plays with the 
      baseball hat in his hands. 
      <p>
<center>MATTHEW<br/>I don't want to say I was popular or<br/>whatever, but 
      you know, people liked<br/>me. It sucks being new.</center>
<p>ANGLE on Buffy [<u>Outfit #2</u>] 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>But this is a new school. Everyone<br/>here is new. 
      <p>MATTHEW<br/>Yeah, but lots of them know each<br/>other from before. I 
      don't have<br/>anywhere to sit at lunch.<br/>(then)<br/>It's stupid. I don't 
      know why I came<br/>here-- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's not stupid. It's like the<br/>teacher's lounge for me. I 
      don't<br/>know what I'm supposed to do in<br/>there. I mean, <u>lounge</u> 
      of course, but<br/>it's weird. I feel awkward, just<br/>like you 
do.</p></p></center>
<p>She smiles at him, confident. He stares at her blankly. 
      <p>
<center>MATTHEW<br/>So, what you're saying is, it doesn't<br/>get any 
      better?</center>
<p>Her face drops. She's going to have to try another tack. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>A jaded-looking hispanic boy, TOMAS, wearing a hooded sweatshirt. His 
      hood is pulled tight to conceal as much of his face as possible. He looks 
      at Buffy and shrugs. 
      <p>
<center>TOMAS<br/>(tough)<br/>I don't want to talk to you, okay?</center>
<p>Buffy looks back at him. [<u>Outfit #3</u>] 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Okay. That's fine.</center>
<p>They sit in silence. 
      <p>
<center>TOMAS<br/>I'm serious! I'm not talking to you! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay.</p></center>
<p>Off Buffy, cut to: 
      <p>OMITTED 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO. 
      <p>Amanda, hunched up in her chair. 
      <p>
<center>AMANDA<br/>He said all sorts of things. Stuff<br/>about how my 
      clothes are all cheap<br/>and I look like a blue-light special. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm sorry Amanda. 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>And then my mom had to go and call<br/>him at his house. 
      Telling him that<br/>he shouldn't make fun of me, just<br/>'cause she's not 
      rich and she's a<br/>single mom and all that. I don't<br/>need him knowing 
      my life story. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's awful being teased. But the<br/>thing is, bullies like 
      that? They're<br/>just-- 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>Insecure?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy shrugs, that <u>is</u> what she was about to say. 
      <p>
<center>AMANDA (cont'd)<br/>Yeah, everyone says that.</center>
<p>Amanda shakes her head. Tears welling. 
      <p>
<center>AMANDA (cont'd)<br/>You know, I'm really tired of<br/>everyone being 
      so insecure.</center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO: 
      <p>Tomas faces BUFFY. Silence. He glares at her. She waits. 
      <p>OMITTED 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE DAY - BACK TO: 
      <p>Matthew facing BUFFY. 
      <p>
<center>MATTHEW<br/>So what am I supposed to do, stick a<br/>sign on my back 
      that says, "Befriend<br/>me?"</center>
<p>Buffy smiles. Matthew doesn't. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Nothing so drastic. Just tomorrow at<br/>lunch, you look 
      for someone who's<br/>sitting alone. And you sit down next<br/>to them. 
      <p>MATTHEW<br/>Yeah? I don't know. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You could picture them in their<br/>underwear, but it might 
      ruin your<br/>appetite.</p></p></center>
<p>He rewards her with a small smile. Then pauses, thinking. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>So, maybe? 
      <p>MATTHEW<br/>Yeah, maybe.</p></center>
<p>Buffy smiles, encouraged. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO: 
      <p>Amanda facing BUFFY. Buffy talks confidently. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You've got to stick up for yourself.<br/>Let this bully 
      know that you won't<br/>take any sh--guff, from him. Any<br/>guff. 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>I'm glad you said that. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, it's true. 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>(quietly)<br/>Well, 'cause that's what I did.<br/>stood up for 
      myself.<br/>The other day after class? I jumped<br/>him in the parking lot 
      and slammed<br/>his stupid-ass insecure face right<br/>into the 
      pavement.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy is stunned. This little hound-dog girl heat the guy up? 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You, <u>what</u>? 
      <p>AMANDA<br/>I guess that's the other reason Mr.<br/>Miller wanted me to 
      see you.<br/>(smiling at BUFFY)<br/>I'm glad someone understands 
      me.<br/>(then)<br/>Do you think I should pound on him<br/>some more?</p></center>
<p>Off Buffy's frozen, wide-eyed smile. 
      <p>EXT. FIELD NEAR GRAVEYARD - DAY 
      <p>WILLOW and Xander walk together through a pretty field. (We can't see 
      any gravestones in the distance.) We join mid- conversation: 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>I bet she's giving them great advice. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Absolutely. Those kids are lucky to<br/>have Buffy looking out 
      for them. I<br/>just wish she believed it. She's<br/>stressing over the 
      whole "college-<br/>drop-out-not-actually-qualified"<br/>thing. Plus, 
      knowing there's a<br/>salivating hellmouth right under<br/>their feet... and 
      the whole... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>"From beneath you it devours."</p></p></center>
<p>She nods. He shudders. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>(grim)<br/>It's not the friendliest jingle, 
      is<br/>it? It's no "I like Ike" or "Milk:<br/>it does a body good." 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I know. It's going to be bad. Real<br/>bad. And I wonder, will 
      I... If it<br/>comes, <u>when</u> it comes, will I be able<br/>to help? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I think you will. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't know. I don't know what I<br/>can do. And frankly, I'm 
      scared of<br/>what I might do. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I get that. Figuring out how to<br/>control your magic seems a 
      lot like<br/>hammering a nail.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She looks at him, dubious. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Hear me out. You're hammering, right?</center>
<p>Xander demonstrates with a pantomime hammer in the air. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>If you hold the hammer at the end,<br/>you have 
      power, but not control. It<br/>could take two strokes to hit in 
      the<br/>nail. Or you could hit your thumb. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Right. Ouch. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So you choke up, then you have<br/>control, but no power. It 
      could take<br/>ten strokes to knock the nail in.<br/>Power, control; it's a 
      trade-off. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That's actually not a bad analogy.<br/>(beat)<br/>Except, I'm 
      less worried about<br/>hitting my thumb and more worried<br/>about going all 
      black-eyed baddy and<br/>bewitching that hammer into cracking<br/>my 
      friends' skulls open like coconuts. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Right. Ouch. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(off his look)<br/>Sorry.<br/>(then)<br/>I don't know, Xander. 
      Being back<br/>here? I'm not sure I'm ready. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You are, I mean it'll take time.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He indicates the area ahead with a nod of his head. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Are you sure you're ready for this?</center>
<p>She nods. He touches her arm. And lets her go on alone. 
      <p>He walks back. She walks forward and we MOVE WITH HER, revealing for 
      the first time that she's walking amid GRAVESTONES. If we want to CRANE UP 
      at this point we'll see we're in the CEMETERY... 
      <p>OMITTED 
      <p>NEW SHOT, level with Willow. The CAMERA tracks with Willow as she finds 
      the gravestone she is looking for. Willow kneels. The CAMERA moves CLOSER 
      still. Until we're close on the marker itself. Tara's name and dates. 
      Slowly, Willow's pale finger traces Tara's name in the stone. And then the 
      dates. As she reaches the year of Tara's death, the hand begins to 
      tremble. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Willow as she brings her trembling hand to her lips. She 
      slumps; sits between her bent knees, like a child. She begins to quietly 
      cry. After a moment, she forces herself to smile through her tears as if 
      not wanting to upset Tara. Reaches out and touches the stone again, 
      holding her hand there, like she's touching Tara. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Hey.</center>
<p>Then she takes some pebbles from the ground and puts them atop the 
      gravestone. (This is Jewish tradition.) 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>It's me.</center>
<p>Then silence, as we hold on Willow with Tara's gravestone. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO: 
      <p>BUFFY, looking sympathetic. Facing her is Tomas. Silence. A long beat. 
      <p>Then Tomas looks at BUFFY, his expression stoic. 
      <p>
<center>TOMAS<br/>I'm scared.</center>
<p>Tears well in Tomas' eyes. He blinks them away. 
      <p>
<center>TOMAS (cont'd)<br/>I don't want to be left all alone.</center>
<p>Off Buffy's empathetic expression: 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>A new kid, PETER NICHOLS, good-looking, rich, confident. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS<br/>I hate to miss Bio., but I thought it<br/>was best 
      that I come talk to you.</center>
<p>[BUFFY in <u>Outfit #1</u>] 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>So, what's on your mind? 
      <p>PETER NICHOLS<br/>On my mind?</p></center>
<p>He looks at her blankly. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(leading)<br/>Are you worried about school,<br/>friends, 
      girls, your parents-- 
      <p>PETER NICHOLS<br/>Yeah, that's it. My parents. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What about them? 
      <p>PETER NICHOLS<br/>Um... issues of divorce. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Divorce is terrible. My parents got<br/>divorced when I was a 
      kid. 
      <p>PETER NICHOLS<br/>Mine are still happily married.<br/>(a beat)<br/>It's 
      hard. I feel left out.<br/>(off her look)<br/>And...uh, I'm also 
      concerned<br/>about... girls!</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy just looks at him. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS (cont'd)<br/>Okay, I'm just bored.<br/>(off her 
      look)<br/>I guess I should get back to Bio. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah.</p></center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO: 
      <p>Tomas talking with BUFFY. 
      <p>
<center>TOMAS<br/>My brother's joining up with the<br/>Marines.</center>
<p>He begins to tear a little. Wipes at his face angrily. 
      <p>
<center>TOMAS (cont'd)<br/>If he knew I was making a fool of<br/>myself like 
      this, he'd smack me in<br/>the head. I'm being stupid. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He sounds like he's pretty tough,<br/>your brother. 
      <p>TOMAS<br/>Yeah. He's, you know, a man. And<br/>I'm just, messed up. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're not messed up. It's not<br/>messed up to worry about 
      your brother.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Tomas looks up. Nods begrudgingly. 
      <p>
<center>TOMAS<br/>Yeah. I mean, what if he... doesn't<br/>come back? What if 
      he gets blown up?<br/>I can't sleep 'cause of this. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Have you talked to your brother?<br/>Told him how you 
      feel?</p></center>
<p>Tomas shakes his head. 
      <p>
<center>TOMAS<br/>Nah. I don't want to. I don't want<br/>to talk to him, 
      okay? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay. 
      <p>TOMAS<br/>I'm not going to talk to him!</p></p></center>
<p>Off Buffy: 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>JOSH, a wild-eyed geeky kid, faces Buffy. He smiles at her. [She's in 
      <u>outfit #2</u>] 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>So, Josh, what's on your mind? 
      <p>JOSH<br/>Um, I'm worried that I'm gay. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay, first of all, I think it's<br/>great that you would talk 
      to me about<br/>this. And you should know there's<br/>nothing shameful about 
      being gay.<br/>Nothing. 
      <p>JOSH<br/>I know. It's just, I'm not positive.<br/>So I was thinking, why 
      don't you go<br/>out on a date with me and I can find<br/>out for 
      sure?</p></p></p></center>
<p>He raises his eyebrows at her, looks at her like, "Am I selling this?" 
      Her sympathetic expression drops. Hold on Buffy as she massages her 
      temples. She's worn out. (This shot carries over to the next scene.) 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUING 
      <p>She looks up, talking to a new kid. [Still in <u>Outfit #2</u>] 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>It sounds like it's difficult for<br/>you. Like maybe your 
      sister makes it<br/>hard for you to establish your own<br/>identity. You 
      said she's<br/>controlling, and that she doesn't let<br/>you make your own 
      decisions--</center>
<p>REVEAL Dawn, who sits opposite Buffy - fidgeting with Buffy's nameplate 
      as she talks... 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Yeah, and she borrows my clothes<br/>without asking. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I understand. That must be hard.</p></center>
<p>INT. ESPRESSO PUMP - DAY 
      <p>Anya is mid-conversation with a sad woman, 30, LULU. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>It <u>is</u> hard. I know, it is. But,<br/>honestly? I bet 
      you'll feel better<br/>if you talk about it. <u>A lot</u> better.</center>
<p>Lulu looks like she's about to talk, then shakes her head. 
      <p>
<center>LULU<br/>You don't mind?</center>
<p>Anya waves off this notion. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Talk to me. 
      <p>LULU<br/>(deeply hurt)<br/>I just. I just can't believe he<br/>forgot. 
      We've been going out for six<br/>years and he forgot my birthday. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Ucch. And he didn't do anything? No<br/>flowers, no card, no 
      dinner at an<br/>extravagantly over-priced restaurant?</p></p></center>
<p>Lulu shakes her head: 
      <p>
<center>LULU<br/>Nothing. And all day long, I kept<br/>thinking he was about 
      to surprise<br/>me... And I guess he did 'cause -<br/>Surprise! - He forgot. 

      <p>ANYA<br/>What a creepazoid. It's like he<br/>didn't just forget your 
      birthday, but<br/>the day on which, in keeping with<br/>modern American 
      tradition, one's life<br/>is celebrated. One's very self.<br/>(then; 
      dire)<br/>He didn't celebrate your self. 
      <p>LULU<br/>He didn't, did he? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>You know what? I think you deserve<br/>vengeance. 
      <p>LULU<br/>(tasting the word)<br/>Vengeance. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(an idea)<br/>How old are you? 
      <p>LULU<br/>What?<br/>(depressed)<br/>I'm... thirty. Why? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Just wishful thinking... But imagine<br/>if he was forced, for 
      thirt-- 
      <p>LULU<br/>Please don't say that... number. I<br/>can't bear to think about 
      it.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Anya checks out Lulu's despondent expression. Thinks. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Did he know this? That you're<br/>freaked about being-- 
      <p>LULU<br/>Older? Maybe, yeah. I mean, I did<br/>tell him I didn't want to 
      make a big<br/>deal about it. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>No big deal. Like no cake, no party,<br/>no presents, no big 
      deal? 
      <p>LULU<br/>I may have said something like that.<br/>But I didn't say no 
      <u>card</u>! I wouldn't<br/>have minded a card.<br/>(then)<br/>As long as it 
      had no specifics, you<br/>know, no mention that I'm... 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Thirty isn't old.<br/>(off Lulu's look)<br/>Believe me. But 
      anyway, this<br/>boyfriend of yours - it sounds like<br/>maybe he was just 
      trying to do what<br/>you wanted. 
      <p>LULU<br/>Yeah. But it wasn't what I wanted.<br/>It was what I said I 
      wanted but, I<br/>guess it wasn't what I really wanted. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>But he tried. I mean, he tried to<br/>respect your wishes. 
      <p>LULU<br/>Yeah, he did. It's kind of sweet if<br/>you think about 
      it.<br/>(then)<br/>But now I'm sad I didn't have a party. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>It's not too late. You could just<br/>celebrate being 
      twenty-nine again. 
      <p>LULU<br/>I could do that. Yeah. Maybe I<br/>could get a piņata. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Knock yourself out.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Lulu smiles and then gathers her stuff, heads for the door. 
      <p>
<center>LULU<br/>Thanks, you've been a big help.</center>
<p>She exits. Anya smiles. Until she realizes that she didn't wreak any 
      vengeance, she looks up, but Lulu is gone. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Wait...</center>
<p>We hold on Anya, totally confused and pissed at herself. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>Buffy sits at her messy desk. [<u>Outfit #3</u>] She is facing a blonde 
      girl with haunted eyes, CASSIE. Cassie wears a t- shirt for the White 
      Stripes (or some cool band the kids are listening to), jeans and old, 
      paint-splattered Pumas. A beat- up composition book is on her lap. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>So you're not doing your homework. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>I guess not. It all seems kind of,<br/>whatever. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I know high school can be<br/>frustrating. But if you just 
      get<br/>through it, then you can go to<br/>college or join the French 
      Foreign<br/>Legion or anything you want. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Yeah. Well, I'm not going to do all<br/>that stuff.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Cassie absent-mindedly braids part of her hair. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Okay, so no French Foreign Legion.<br/>I get that. I mean, 
      all the changing<br/>your name and being indentured for<br/>years and 
      occupying Algeria. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>It's just, I'm not graduating from<br/>high school. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Why not?</p></p></center>
<p>Cassie looks around the room. Then back at Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>I like that shirt. Where did you-- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Don't change the subject, Cassie<br/>why wouldn't you graduate? 

      <p>CASSIE<br/>(resigned)<br/>Because next Friday I'm gonna die.</p></p></center>
<p>Off Buffy's reaction.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - CONTINUING 
      <p>Buffy looks at Cassie. Alert now, her voice held steady. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What?</center>
<p>Cassie averts her eyes. Undoes a braid of hair. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>Can we talk, about something else? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No. We have to talk about this. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Just, never mind... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Cassie, what makes you feel like this? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Feel like what? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Like you want to... hurt yourself.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Cassie looks up, alert. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>I'm not going to commit suicide, if<br/>that's what 
      you're saying. No way. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay. Then, what, what <u>are</u> you<br/>saying?</p></center>
<p>A frustrated shrug. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>Look, I don't mean to be a pain, you<br/>seem really 
      nice, and I know you just<br/>want to help, but I'm just wasting<br/>your 
      time. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, you're not. This is why I'm<br/>here. Tell me why you think 
      you're<br/>going to die.</p></center>
<p>Cassie looks at Buffy, shrugs. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>I don't think it; I know it. I just,<br/><u>know</u>. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What do you mean, you know? Are you<br/>saying you know someone 
      wants to hurt<br/>you? Has someone threatened you? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>No. I just know next Friday I'm<br/>going to die. Some things, 
      I just<br/>know. I don't know how I do, I just<br/>do. Like, I know there's 
      gonna be<br/>coins.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy is mystified. Cassie looks off in the distance. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Coins? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Lots of coins. Weird ones. And I<br/>know you'll go someplace, 
      dark...<br/>underground. I don't know... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What do you mean, underground?</p></p></center>
<p>Cassie looks at Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>And I know you'll try to help. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Cassie, I don't understand what<br/>you're--</p></center>
<p>The BELL RINGS ending the class period. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>But you can't, okay?</center>
<p>Cassie stands. Holds her composition book to her chest. BUFFY stands 
      too, not wanting her to go. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE (cont'd)<br/>(apologetically)<br/>I gotta go. Trig. I don't 
      want Mr.<br/>Corrigan sending me to Principal 
      Wood<br/>again.<br/>(then)<br/>Look, about what I said? Try not to<br/>worry. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I-- 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Thanks for being nice. And I really<br/>do like that shirt. 
      The color's good<br/>for you. You should put on a sweater<br/>so it doesn't 
      get stained. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Cassie, wait-- 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>I gotta go.</p></p></p></p></center>With a light wave she's out the door, 
      leaving BUFFY stunned. 
      <p>INT. PRINCIPAL WOOD'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>Principal Wood sits on the edge of his desk. Buffy stands facing him, 
      distressed, urgent. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What am I supposed to do? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>You did what you were supposed to.<br/>You reported 
      the situation to me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>And...</p></p></p></center>
<p>He lets out a big breath, rubs the bridge of his nose. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>It's hard. Kids this age, 
      they're<br/>hurting, they're pissed. And they<br/>say things. Sometimes they 
      say awful<br/>things.</center>
<p>As he talks, Principal Wood goes to pour two cups of coffee. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>When I was in school I got into 
      a<br/>thing with this guy. Real bully.<br/>told everyone he'd better "sleep 
      with<br/>one eye open 'cause I was gonna bust<br/>his ass."</center>
<p>He hands Buffy a cup of coffee. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>I got suspended. Talk like that 
      is<br/>taken pretty seriously where I come<br/>from- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The hood? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Beverly Hills. Which is a hood.<br/>(off her 
      discomfort)<br/>The point is - I was talking big<br/>because I was scared. I 
      couldn't<br/>bust a move in high school, let alone<br/>an ass. Most of the 
      time that's what<br/>it is when students act out. Fear,<br/>pain... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But sometimes, sometimes it's not<br/>just talk, right? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>One in a hundred, maybe two hundred,<br/>they're for 
      real. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So what do we do? How do we help her? 
      <p>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Every time there's a threat like<br/>this, we do the 
      same dance.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He walks back around his desk. Sitting down. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Inform teachers, search lockers. 
      But<br/>we can't know what's going to happen,<br/>and we can't search their 
      brains. We<br/>just do what we can.</center>
<p>Buffy shakes her head; frustrated. Walks towards his desk. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>It's not enough. I want to, I don't<br/>know what. I need 
      to do something.<br/>I need to make this better.</center>
<p>Buffy bumps against the edge of the desk, jerks her cup of coffee, 
      spilling it on her shirt. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Ow! Shoot! I need to...</center>
<p>She stares at the stain as it spreads on her clean shirt. 
      <p>INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
      <p>A few kids amble down the hall, passing between classes. 
      <p>We PICK UP ON DAWN and follow her to her locker. She opens it. Tosses 
      in the textbooks she's carrying and grabs a new one. Slams the locker shut 
      and REVEALS BUFFY - who looks serious. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I have a job for you.</center>
<p>INT. NEW HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY 
      <p>Dawn walks amid the shelves of books. Pretending to look for a title, 
      but really she's watching... 
      <p>DAWN'S POV: Cassie and a cute boy, MIKE WARBURTON, sit at a library 
      table. Mike wears an army jacket, but he's pretty clean-cut. He's got a 
      history text in front of him. Cassie's got a copy of "Franny and Zooey" by 
      Salinger near her and is drawing in her composition book. Mike tries to 
      look at her notebook: 
      <p>
<center>MIKE<br/>What're you drawing?</center>
<p>Cassie closes her notebook, marking the page with her hand. She smiles 
      at him. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>Don't you have a history test to<br/>study for? 
      <p>MIKE<br/>Why don't you design a tattoo for me? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>A tattoo? Yeah, right. I can just<br/>picture that. 
      <p>MIKE<br/>C'mon, design something and we can<br/>get matching tattoos. 
      Maybe like a<br/>snake with some fire coming out of<br/>it's mouth. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Or a sexy hula girl who wiggles when<br/>you flex? 
      <p>MIKE<br/>Now you're talking. Like a sexy hula<br/>girl, but a sexy 
      <u>snake</u> hula girl.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Cassie smiles at him. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>You're so ridiculous.</center>
<p>She goes back to her drawing. He looks back at his textbook and then, 
      after a moment, looks up again. 
      <p>
<center>MIKE<br/>So... I was kind of thinking maybe we<br/>should go to that 
      dance after all.</center>
<p>She doesn't look up. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>What do you mean "after all"? I told<br/>you I don't want 
      to go. 
      <p>MIKE<br/>I assumed you were kidding.</p></center>
<p>She looks up, smiles at him. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>It'd probably just be lame anyway. 
      <p>MIKE<br/>Yeah, but lame is funny. And maybe<br/>fun. If we're, you know, 
      hanging out<br/>together.</p></center>
<p>Dawn approaches. She stands by their table hesitantly. Mike and Cassie 
      don't notice her at first. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>We hang out all the time. 
      <p>MIKE<br/>Right. And therefore, we should hang<br/>out at the Winter 
      Formal. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Hey.</p></p></center>
<p>They turn to look at her. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>I'm in ceramics with you? Dawn<br/>Summers. Do you 
      remember if we had<br/>an assignment last week? I spaced. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Right. Hey, Dawn. I like your<br/>ashtray work. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Thanks. They can also be used as<br/>jewelry holders. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>That's the genius.<br/>(then)<br/>There was an assignment but I 
      didn't<br/>write it down. Something to do with<br/>glazes -</p></p></p></center>
<p>Mike stands - gathers his stuff. 
      <p>
<center>MIKE<br/>As scintillating as this pottery talk<br/>is, I'd better go 
      and actually study.<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>I'm Mike, by the way. Cassie 
      talks<br/>about your ashtrays all the time. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Hi. Sorry. I didn't mean to- 
      <p>MIKE<br/>Don't worry about it. I gotta hit<br/>the books if I'm going to 
      ace this<br/>test like it deserves to be aced. It<br/>was nice meeting you 
      though. Cass,<br/>I'll see you later? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>(calling after him)<br/>Hey Mike! You're going to get a B. 
      <p>MIKE<br/>(without turning)<br/>A-plus baby, A-plus.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Cassie and Dawn are left alone. Dawn notes "Franny and Zooey" 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Is that any good? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Yeah, actually, yeah. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What do you have to read it for? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Oh, just for me I guess. I've pretty<br/>much stopped reading 
      my school<br/>assignments. I just read what I want.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Dawn sits. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>That's so cool. I'd do that, but my<br/>sister would be 
      down my neck in a<br/>second. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Summers. Hey, is your sister Ms.<br/>Summers the counselor? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Yeah, lucky me, huh? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Nah, she's nice. I saw her this<br/>morning actually. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Oh yeah?<br/>(casually)<br/>What about?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Cassie's high spirits evaporate. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>I'm sorry, It's none of my business. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Oh, I don't care.</p></center>
<p>An awkward moment. Dawn tries to change the subject: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>So. Mike's a cutie. Are you guys<br/>going to that dance? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>I don't think so. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Oh, I...I mean, didn't he ask you? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Only like a hundred and five times. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You said no? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>A hundred and <u>six</u> times. I, I can't<br/>go. I'm not 
      going to be around that<br/>night.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Off Dawn's look. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' LIVING ROOM - EVENING - TWO DAYS LATER 
      <p>The back part of the room: their new "HQ." Willow is working on her 
      computer, anxious to be helpful. Xander and Buffy look over her shoulder. 
      The table is piled with papers. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Cassie's records all show the same<br/>story - Good 
      grades, good kid. Then<br/>suddenly, not so good grades,<br/>absenteeism, 
      comments about apathy<br/>and depression. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So, the question is, what changed? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Right. If she did have some kind of<br/>psychic vision, that 
      <u>would</u> explain<br/>it. I mean, it's hard to do homework<br/>if you 
      think you're about to die. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(skeptical)<br/>You really think this girl is some<br/>kind of 
      precog? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don't know. Maybe. I told you how<br/>she-- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Buff, you spilled a cup of coffee.<br/>I'm not saying you 
      don't have Slayer<br/>Grace? But it's not the first time. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Maybe, just maybe, you're trying so<br/>hard to help, that 
      you're seeing<br/>paranormal where there's just normal.<br/>Depressed 
      normal, but normal. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Maybe. But, maybe not.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow nods 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Want me to check medical records? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Her doctor already sent them.</p></center>
<p>Xander grabs a folder from her MD from the table. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(reading)<br/>Strep throat, ear infections, 
      yeast<br/>infection, none of my business. No<br/>real info here. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We got zip. And we're running out of<br/>days. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Have you Googled her? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(aghast)<br/>Willow! She's seventeen! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It's a search engine. Look.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow types a few things. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Let's see what Cassie Newton pulls up. 
      <p>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Hey, check this: she has her own site. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>A day and a half of researching and<br/>we finally try looking 
      up <u>her</u>.</p></p></center>
<p>ANGLE from behind, allowing us to see the web site. There are a bunch 
      of drawings, paintings, many of them self- portraits. A lot of them sad 
      and dark. But mostly poems. Lots of them. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Wow. Lotta poems here. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Poems. Always a sign of pretentious<br/>inner turmoil. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(ignoring/reads)<br/>The sheets above me cool my skin/<br/>like 
      dirt on a mad woman's grave/</p></p></center>
<p>ANGLE ON Willow, reading. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I rise into the moonlight white/ And<br/>watch 
      the mirror stare/</center>
<p>ANGLE ON Xander, listening. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Pale fish looks back at me/ Pale fish<br/>that 
      will never swim/</center>
<p>ANGLE ON Dawn as she enters the front door. She slows, realizing she 
      shouldn't interrupt, quietly puts down her backpack. Listens. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>My skin is milk for no man to drink/<br/>my 
      thighs unused, unclenched/ this<br/>body is not ready yet/ But dirt 
      waits<br/>for no woman/ And coins will buy no<br/>time/</center>
<p>ANGLE ON Buffy. Listening, moved by the girl's words. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I hear the chatter of the bugs/ It's<br/>they 
      alone will feast</center>
<p>A beat. (ANGLE includes all of them.) Dawn approaches. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Okay... Death really is on her brain. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>We all deal with death... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>But this girl isn't just dealing.<br/>She's giving death a 
      long sloppy word<br/>kiss. She has a yen for the big dirt<br/>nap. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't know. A lot of teenagers<br/>post some pretty angsty 
      poetry on the<br/>web. I even posted a melodramatic<br/>love poem or two 
      back in the day. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Love poems? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm over you now, Sweetie. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(flattered)<br/>Love poems. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Look, all I'm saying is this is<br/>normal teen stuff, You 
      join chat<br/>rooms, you write poems, you post<br/>Doogie Howser fan fic. 
      It's normal.<br/>Right?<br/>(quickly)<br/>Let's see if there're any other 
      sites.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Dawn shakes her head. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(cocky)<br/>You guys are way off track. I got a<br/>hunch on 
      this one.</center>
<p>Willow is back on the main page. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I think we've seen most of this.<br/>Here's something, oh 
      no, it's<br/>"<u>Phillip</u> Newton." 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's her dad. Open that. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I'm telling you I got this case<br/>cracked wide open. I got the 
      suspect<br/>fingered. I told you about Mike<br/>Warburton, right? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The one who asked her to the dance? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Right. The one who <u>keeps</u> asking her<br/>to the dance. I'm 
      thinking, who<br/>likes to be rejected? Nobody. I'm<br/>thinking, some 
      people can't <u>handle</u><br/>rejection. I'm thinking-- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I got something here!</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They all turn to look at the screen. A page titled "Sunnydale Police 
      Records." "Phillip Newton" is highlighted. A list of charges follows: 
      "Drunk and Disorderly;" "Disturbing the Peace;" "Disorderly conduct." 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Drunk and Disorderly. Disturbing 
      the<br/>Peace...a lot of charges here. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Her dad's a drunk. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>A violent drunk? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We better find out. Here's his<br/>address. Xand, you got your 
      keys?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander and Buffy rise and prepare to head out. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>You guys! Listen up. I'm telling<br/>you, I'm liking Mike 
      Warburton for<br/>the perp. Let's collar him before he<br/>lawyers 
      up!</center>
<p>But they're gone. 
      <p>EXT. MR. NEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and Xander stand on the stoop of a small, sort of crummy house. 
      The porch light FLICKERS. They KNOCK. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Buffy the Vampire Slayer would just<br/>kick down this 
      door. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>And Buffy the counselor? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Waits.</p></p></center>
<p>They KNOCK again. The door opens as far as the security chain will 
      allow. A big man, PHILLIP NEWTON, looks out. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Mr. Newton? 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>That's right. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I work at your daughter's school. I<br/>need to talk to 
      you.</p></p></center>
<p>Off Mr. Newton, looking less than thrilled at this. 
      <p>INT. MR. NEWTON'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>We're inside Mr. Newton's place now. It's a mess. A table with a bottle 
      of Scotch and a drinking glass is in plain view. 
      <p>
<center>MR. NEWTON<br/>Is she screwing up her grades again?<br/>She's not 
      the sharpest apple in the<br/>barrel. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>She's having some problems. But it's<br/>kind of <u>you</u> I 
      want to talk about. 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>What about? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I know you got picked up by the<br/>police a couple times. Are 
      you still<br/>drinking a lot? 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>What's that got to do with Cassie? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You tell us. 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>What's this, "You tell us"? Who do<br/>you two think you 
      are, McMillan and<br/>Wife? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>He looked at me. He just said "wife"<br/>and 
      looked at me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Xander.<br/>(then)<br/>Mr. Newton, I don't know exactly 
      how<br/>to ask this... 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>Ask what? Look, I let you into my<br/>house, but I'm tired 
      and I got things<br/>to do.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander glances over at the bottle of booze: 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Yeah, you look real busy--</center>
<p>BUFFY cuts him off. She's got to do this. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Frankly, we're worried that you might<br/>drink too much 
      and hurt Cassie.</center>
<p>Silence. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>That's all.</center>
<p>Mr. Newton smiles a slim smile. Nods repeatedly. But his eyes are lit 
      with anger. As he talks, his temper rises: 
      <p>
<center>MR. NEWTON<br/>Oh, I see. That's all, You come in<br/>here in the 
      middle of the night, into<br/>my home, and start accusing me of<br/>beating 
      on my daughter? That's <u>all</u>? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We just want to make sure-- 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>Well, that's a lie. Who told you--<br/>Did Cassie's mother 
      put you up to<br/>this? 'Cause I pay my support, okay?<br/>To the dime. She 
      just wants to take<br/>away the one weekend a month I get to<br/>see my 
      girl. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Which is when? 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>What? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Which weekend is it? 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>I just had her. Last weekend. Look,<br/>I may not be the 
      greatest dad in the<br/>world. But I don't beat up my girl.<br/>I don't- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Will you see her this Friday? 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>Not unless my ex-wife gets a<br/>personality transplant. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(thinking)<br/>Okay. 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>Okay, what? Okay, now you'll yet out<br/>of my house? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. Yeah, we will.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She heads to the door. Xander follows. Buffy turns: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You know, I'm not going to let<br/>anything 
      happen to Cassie. 
      <p>MR. NEWTON<br/>Is that a threat? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Shouldn't it be a comfort?</p></p></center>
<p>Mr. Newton is taken aback; his indignant expression drops. Buffy and 
      Xander quietly exit, closing the door behind them. 
      <p>EXT. MR. NEWTON'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Buffy and Xander exit onto the poorly-lit stoop. 
      <p>Suddenly, Cassie emerges from the shadows. Looking haunted as a 
      specter. Startling them both. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>It's not him. He's not the one who<br/>does it.<br/>(to 
      Buffy)<br/>Thank you for trying. But I probably<br/>shouldn't have told you 
      anything.<br/>You're making such a big deal and I<br/>want it all to 
      just...go away. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Are you talking about... killing<br/>yourself? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>No! Of course not. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Then fight. Try. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>There's no point. I told you- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>See, that doesn't sound like someone<br/>who really wants to 
      live. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>How can you say that? You think I<br/>want this? That I don't 
      care?</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She looks up for a minute, trying to keep back tears. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE (cont'd)<br/>Believe me. I want to... be here, do<br/>things. 
      I want to graduate from high<br/>school. I want go to the stupid<br/>Winter 
      Formal. I have this friend,<br/>and it would be fun to go with him.<br/>Just 
      to dance, hear lame music, to<br/>wear a silly dress and laugh 
      and<br/>stuff. I'd like to go. There's a<br/>lot I'd like to do.</center>
<p>She is crying a little now. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE (cont'd)<br/>You know, I'd love to ice skate 
      at<br/>Rockefeller Center. And I'd love to<br/>watch my cousins grow up, see 
      who<br/>they become - cause they're really<br/>mean and I think they're 
      gonna be<br/>fat. And I've never been to the<br/>Louvre. I'd love to see the 
      Mona<br/>Lisa. Or meet Peter Falk. Or<br/>backpack across the country. Or, 
      I<br/>don't know... fall in love.</center>
<p>She shrugs; looks at them with clear, shining eyes. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE (cont'd)<br/>But I won't. I just... never will.</center>
<p>Buffy and Xander are both shaken. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Cassie, no. You will. You will.<br/>You just have to tell 
      us what you<br/>know. Everything about this...<br/>Please, please, help us. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>I can't. I just know. It's going to<br/>happen. I don't know 
      why and I don't<br/>know how. But something out there is<br/>going to kill 
      me.</p></center>

<p>INT. NEW HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY - NIGHT 
      <p>Ten RED ROPED FIGURES walk slowly in a circle. Hoods cover their faces. 
      Each holds a BURNING CANDLE. They each point their candles towards the 
      center of the circle. 
      <p>An OVERHRAD SHOT reveals what the robed figures are circling: STRANGE 
      FOREIGN COINS are laid out in an intricate arrangement of concentric 
      circles. At the very center of the arrangement is a paper shrine 
      consisting of an enlarged YEARBOOK PHOTO OF CASSIE and some print-outs of 
      her POEMS. 
      <p>The flames leap from their candles and the paper begins to burn. The 
      photo of Cassie is devoured by flames.

      <p>ANGLE ON Buffy and the computer screen. She's on Cassie's web site. 
      Reading her poetry. She reads quietly for a long moment. Starts to read 
      out loud:

      she wrote.

      <p>Dark and dank. A pile of discarded crates. On one sits SPIKE. Spine 
      straight, eyes staring forward. Still. 
      <p>From the darkness, Buffy approaches. He doesn't react. She's standing 
      right in front of him. Waves her hand in front of his eyes. Nothing. Snaps 
      her fingers. Nothing.

<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike! What are you doing?</center>
<p>No response, then: 
      <p>

      <p>BUFFY<br/>Do you know anything? Spike? Is<br/>there something, something 
      evil, in<br/>the school... down here maybe? Do you<br/>know 
      anything?</p></p></center>
<p>He blinks more. His neck strains. Trying not to listen. He nods. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Yes.</center>
<p>He closes his eyes. Trying to block out the pain. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>There's evil. Down here. Right<br/>here. I'm a 
      bad man. William is a<br/>bad man. I hurt the girl.</center>

      head. BUFFY grabs his wrists, stopping him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike! Stop it! What did you do?</center>
<p>He looks up at BUFFY. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>I hurt you Buffy and I will pay. I<br/>am paying. Because 
      I hurt the girl.

<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Mike Warburton walking quickly down the hall. His face is dark. He 
      carries a paper in his hand. 
      <p>In the BG, a JANITOR opens lockers, which Principal Wood and another 
      TEACHER search. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>Where's your hall pass?</center>
<p>Mike looks up and sees Buffy in front of him, arms folded. 
      <p>
<center>MIKE<br/>No hall pass. I got a free period. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You look kinda upset. Something on<br/>your mind? 
      <p>MIKE<br/>Nah, not really.</p></p></center>

      test with a big "B" circled in red pen. 
      <p>
<center>MIKE (cont'd)<br/>A lousy B in Egyptian History. I<br/>knew this

      problems, but<br/>honestly? I'm not one of them. I'm<br/>fine.<br/>(off her 
      stern look)<br/>Anyway, it's no big deal. I got this<br/>friend I really

      <p>BUFFY<br/>Crazy? 
      <p>MIKE<br/>Yeah, Sometimes I wanna -- Hey,<br/>that's funny, you're Dawn's 
      sister,<br/>right? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Dawn is <u>my</u> sister, That's right. 
      <p>MIKE<br/>That's so weird. I was just thinking<br/>about her. I was 
      thinking, if Cassie<br/>won't budge, maybe I'll ask Dawn. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You wouldn't be mad at Cassie? With<br/>her <u>rejecting</u> 
      you like that? 
      <p>MIKE<br/>Nah. She's a girl. Making boys<br/>crazy is like her job 
      description.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy is relieved. She smiles at him. Then her smile drops. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You're asking my sister to the prom?<br/>(then)<br/>And 
      she's your <u>second</u> choice?</center>
<p>A CLATTER OF METAL ON TILE makes BUFFY turn. 
      <p>ANGLE ON a mass of FOREIGN COINS as they clatter out of a searched 
      locker on to the hallway floor. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>(to Mike)<br/>I'll be keeping an eye on 
      you.</center>
<p>Mike shakes his head, smiling and continues down the hall. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Buffy as she joins Principal Wood, the Teacher and Janitor by 
      the opened locker. 
      <p>
<center>PRINCIPAL WOOD<br/>Looks like someone's got a 
      coin<br/>collection.</center>
<p>ANGLE ON the odd coins all over the floor. 
      <p>Buffy picks up a coin, turns it over in her hand. The Janitor and 
      Teacher are scooping the coins up, putting them back in the locker. Buffy 
      closes the locker door slightly, getting a look at the number: "174." She 
      pockets the coin and heads down the hall. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>BUFFY perches on the edge of her desk. A small kid, MARTIN WILDER, 
      enters. 
      <p>
<center>MARTIN<br/>You wanted to see me? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You have locker number 174? 
      <p>MARTIN<br/>Yeah.<br/>(then; nervous) Why?</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy holds out the foreign coin. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I want you to tell me what this is,<br/>and what it has to 
      do with a girl<br/>called Cassie Newton. 
      <p>MARTIN<br/>I-I don't know. It's late. I'm<br/>going to miss my bus. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I know it's late. That's why I don't<br/>have time to mess 
      around. You need<br/>to talk to me. Now.</p></p></center>
<p>EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - DAY 
      <p>Dawn and Cassie exit the school and walk down the steps. Students are 
      everywhere, heading home, catching buses. At the bottom of the steps, 
      Cassie stops, looks at Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>Well, I guess this is good-bye.</center>
<p>Dawn's eyes flash with panic. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>No!<br/>(recovering)<br/>I mean, hey, I'll walk you home. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>That's okay. I'm going to my mom's.<br/>It's kind of 
      far.</p></center>
<p>Cassie starts to walk again. Dawn keeps pace. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Far sounds good. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>(looks at her)<br/>Dawn. I know what's going on here. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Uh, what? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Buffy told you about me, didn't she?<br/>She told you to 
      pretend to be my<br/>friend. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>No!<br/>(then)<br/>Maybe? Cassie, she was scared. She<br/>wanted 
      to help you. 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Well, she can't--</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They reach the corner. Stop. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Maybe she can. She's... different<br/>than you think. She's 
      got<br/>powers... of helping and she was<br/>worried. And now I'm worried. 
      But<br/>I wasn't. Pretending. At all. I<br/>wanted to be your 
      friend.</center>
<p>A beat. And then Cassie gives her a smile. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>You are my friend. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Yeah? 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Yeah. Just remember, I'm not as<br/>stupid as I look. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I'm glad. 
      <p>PETER NICHOLS (O.S.)<br/>Hey, Summers! 
      <p>CASSIE<br/>Listen, Dawn, what happens now? It's<br/>not your fault, okay? 

      <p>PETER NICHOLS<br/>Summers.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Dawn, torn, moves away from Cassie. Leaves her standing at the corner 
      alone. [Note: Because there's a building there, we can't see around the 
      corner.] 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>What is it, Peter? 
      <p>PETER NICHOLS<br/>I was just wondering if anyone asked<br/>you to the 
      Winter Formal. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What? Um, no. Not exactly.</p></p></center>
<p>She gives him a shy smile. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS<br/>Oh yeah? Well, I was just doing a<br/>poll. See 
      ya!</center>
<p>He gives her a cocky smile. Sucker. He saunters off. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>That guy is such an ass-- Cassie?<br/>Cassie!</center>
<p>Dawn looks around frantically. Cassie is gone. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Cassie!</center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>Buffy talking to Martin Wilder. He looks upset. 
      <p>
<center>MARTIN<br/>Believe me, I'd tell you it I knew<br/>anything. I 
      just... don't.</center>
<p>Buffy slides off the edge of her desk. Gets in Martin's face. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You know why I came back here to<br/>Sunnydale High? 
      <p>MARTIN<br/>To creep me out? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(with growing<br/>intensity)<br/>To help. I'm a counselor 
      here<br/>because I want to help. I know what<br/>it's like to walk these 
      halls and<br/>feel lost. Alone... All I want to<br/>do is make things 
      better. Connect.<br/>And I'm gonna connect with your face<br/>if you don't 
      stop wasting my time and<br/>help me do my job.</p></p></center>
<p>A beat as Martin takes this in. He's caving. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>A girl could die. 
      <p>MARTIN<br/>I, please...</p></center>
<p>One more glance at Buffy's face and he caves: 
      <p>
<center>MARTIN (cont'd)<br/>I guess I know who you're talking<br/>about. 
      She's some weirdo suicidal<br/>poet girl. These guys I know want to<br/>mess 
      with her. They've got this plan.</center>
<p>INT. NEW HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY - NIGHT 
      <p>The Red Robed figures hold lit candles and circle the arrangement of 
      coins as before. Then one walks to the front of the room where there is a 
      LARGE CEREMONIAL TORCH. 
      <p>
<center>LEADER OF THE CULT<br/>All present?</center>
<p>As they kneel on either side of the coin arrangement: 
      <p>
<center>RED ROBED FIGURES<br/>All present.</center>
<p>The Leader's hood falls back a bit: He is Peter Nichols. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS<br/>Then we begin.</center>
<p>With his candle, Peter lights the torch behind him. One of the cult 
      members GIGGLES with excitement. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS (cont'd)<br/>Mandel, shut up. 
      <p>RED ROBED FIGURE #1<br/>Sorry, dude. It's just so cool. 
      <p>PETER NICHOLS<br/>O'Keefe, did you take care of the<br/>fire exits? 
      <p>RED ROBED FIGURE #2<br/>Yeah. Anyone tries to bust in here's<br/>getting 
      a nasty surprise. I set up<br/>this booby-trap that my cousin Ben<br/>used 
      to-- 
      <p>PETER NICHOLS<br/>Fine. No one's getting in.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He goes behind a bookshelf and drags out the heretofore unseen Cassie. 
      She is bound in ropes, her mouth taped with duct tape, a blindfold over 
      her eyes. She can barely move. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS (cont'd)<br/>And no one's getting out.</center>
<p>The cult boys audibly suck in their breath. 
      <p>
<center>RED ROBED FIGURE #1<br/>Du-ude... 
      <p>PETER NICHOLS<br/>The sacrifice.</p></center>
<p>He pulls off Cassie's blindfold. 
      <p>CASSIE'S POV: She looks at Peter, the robed figures before her. Her 
      eyes stop on the arrangement of coins. 
      <p>ANGLE ON PETER as he picks up a big MEAT CLEAVER. He puts it to 
      Cassie's throat. Looks her in the eye. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS (cont'd)<br/>Extinguish.</center>
<p>The cult boys wet their fingers and extinguish their candles. There's 
      an audible SSSS. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS (cont'd)<br/>(ceremonial)<br/>Almighty Avilas, please 
      accept our<br/>sacrifice. Appear before us, oh<br/>mighty soldier of the 
      dark. Appear<br/>and grant us infinite riches and we<br/>will pay with our 
      sacrifice. We kneel<br/>before you with your gift of flesh.</center>
<p>ANGLE on the cult members. One suddenly stands, throws back the robe's 
      hood: It's BUFFY. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Okay, <u>that</u> is going on your permanent<br/>record. 
      <p>PETER NICHOLS<br/>It's that counselor. What's she--? 
      <p>RED ROBED FIGURE #1<br/>(to Buffy; pointing<br/>at Peter)<br/>It was his 
      idea!</p></p></center>
<p>The other cult boys JUMP Buffy. She fights them easily. A few PUNCHES 
      knock them back on their asses. Buffy gets up to Peter who threatens her 
      with the cleaver. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS<br/>Back off!</center>
<p>She doesn't. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS (cont'd)<br/>Stupid bitch!</center>
<p>Buffy turns back and then wheels, HITTING him smack in the face. He 
      falls back against the wall. His nose starts to bleed. He staggers towards 
      her, swinging the cleaver. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS (cont'd)<br/>You're gonna die. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay, do you <u>know</u> how lame this is?</p></center>
<p>She kicks Peter in the nuts. He crumples, dropping the cleaver. Buffy 
      steps on it. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Bored teenage boys trying to raise a<br/>demon. 
      Sorry it was a no-show. You<br/>know, I bet it's 'cause you forgot<br/>the 
      boom box blaring... some heavy<br/>metal thing like.. Blue Clam Cult!<br/>I 
      think that's the key to the raising<br/>of lame demons--</center>
<p>From the ground, Peter points: 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS<br/>That lame demon?</center>
<p>Buffy turns where he's pointing and sees: 
      <p>A huge, nasty, drooling AVILAS DEMON. [Details TBD) Not exactly lame. 
      <p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. NEW HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Where we left off. Buffy faces the Avilas Demon. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Buffy, shocked, as she looks up at the Demon. 
      <p>ANGLE ON the Demon, drooling, fixated on Cassie. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Cassie, closing her eyes. 
      <p>ANGLE ON the cult boys. A couple of faces of amazement. 
      <p>Some of pure horror, fear. 
      <p>
<center>RED ROBED FIGURE #1<br/>Dude... help.</center>
<p>Buffy grabs the meat cleaver and charges. HURLS it into the Demon's 
      belly. 
      <p>Where it sticks. The Demon SNORTS, as if laughing. It SWATS at Buffy, 
      hits her square across the face. 
      <p>She is KNOCKED ACROSS THE ROOM. Her head CRACKING against a bookshelf. 
      <p>The Demon rips the cleaver from its own flesh and HURLS it to the 
      ground. Then charges towards prostrate Buffy 
      <p>ANGLE ON Peter Nichols, blood dripping from his nose as he scrambles 
      for the cleaver. Picks it up and heads through the chaos toward Cassie. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Buffy lying on her back, her hand searches for a Weapon, any 
      weapon. Nothing. The Demon leans down to her... and suddenly, she KICKS 
      UP, pushing off her arms so that her feet hit the creature RIGHT IN THE 
      FACE. It backs off a step. She scrambles to her feet. PUNCHES the creature 
      in the gut. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Peter Nichols, who is almost upon Cassie now. He is breathing 
      hard, his face distorted, determined to kill her. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Buffy as she sees Peter nearing Cassie. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>No!</center>
<p>She starts to run towards him. A couple of the cult boys, including RED 
      ROBED FIGURE #2, get in her way, trying to stop her. Buffy shoves them 
      aside. 
      <p>PUNCHES #2 in the stomach and sends him sprawling into Peter Nichols - 
      who is temporarily thwarted in his effort to kill Cassie. 
      <p>Buffy moves toward Peter, but the Avilas GRABS HER and FLINGS her to 
      the ground. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Red Robed Figure #1. His nose is running, his eyes tearing, 
      definitely wigging out 
      <p>
<center>RED ROBED FIGURE #1<br/>Stop this! Somebody stop this!</center>
<p>ANGLE ON Buffy. On the ground again. Kicking her legs up at the Demon. 
      She's not in great shape here. 
      <p>The Demon STEPS ON Buffy. Its giant foot CRUSHING her chest. It leans 
      in, jaw widening, ready to feed. When suddenly it SCREAMS, turns to snap 
      at something, or someone, behind it: 
      <p>Spike, holding the torch, BURNING the Demon's flesh. Buffy gets to her 
      feet. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike! 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Here to help. No hurting the girl. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You untie her. I'll take...</p></p></center>
<p>She grabs the torch from Spike. Spike heads for Cassie. 
      <p>Buffy hits the Demon across the head with the burning torch It reels, 
      flesh on its face SIZZLING. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>...care of this.</center>
<p>ANGLE ON Peter, who has made his way back to Cassie. He holds the 
      cleaver back like a baseball bat; about to cut off Cassie's head... when 
      Spike takes him to the ground. The cleaver drops. Spike begins to PUNCH 
      him silly. Between blows: 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS<br/>Who... are... you? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I'm a bad man.</p></center>
<p>HITTING HIM again and again. 
      <p>ANGLE ON BUFFY. Holding the torch against the Demon. Its flesh starts 
      to BURN. It SCREAMS... in great pain. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Spike, Cassie and Peter. Peter is MOANING on the ground. Spike 
      uses the cleaver to cut Cassie free from her bonds. Pulls the duct tape 
      off her mouth. She gasps for air. Looks at Spike. Seems to recognize him. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>She'll tell you. Someday she'll tell<br/>you.</center>
<p>ANGLE ON BUFFY and the Demon. It's burning and SCREAMING and melting 
      before her. It crumples to the ground. Seems dead. 
      <p>Buffy runs to Cassie. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Are you okay?</center>
<p>Cassie nods shakily. 
      <p>Spike, stunned by what Cassie just told him, backs away. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Peter Nichols, dragging his bruised and bloody body towards 
      the body of the Demon. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS<br/>You can't be dead! Where's my<br/>infinite 
      riches?</center>
<p>And then with it's dying breath, the Demon SNAPS at Peter, biting his 
      shoulder. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS (cont'd)<br/>AAAAA! It bit me!</center>
<p>And the Avilas Demon explodes in a BURST OF FLAME. Which then 
      disappears. Leaving no trace of the monster. Except for the blood and 
      mayhem in the library. 
      <p>
<center>PETER NICHOLS (cont'd)<br/>(to BUFFY)<br/>I'm bleeding! Help me! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Sorry, my office hours are ten to<br/>four.</p></center>
<p>Red Robed Figure #2 runs over to Peter, kneeling, staunching the wound 
      on Peter's shoulder. 
      <p>ANGLE ON Buffy: her arm around Cassie. They walk towards the exit, 
      passing the beat up, terrified cult boys. All of them are either 
      unconscious or huddled on the ground. 
      <p>INT. NEW LIBRARY - EXIT - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>BUFFY AND CASSIE GET TO the exit door, which is in a private, 
      alcove-like area of the library (You can't see the cult boys.) 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(to Cassie, gentle)<br/>It's all okay now.</center>
<p>They open the door and the booby-trap is sprung! A CROSS-BOW releases 
      an arrow which SHOOTS RIGHT TOWARDS CASSIE! Buffy snaps out a hand and 
      CATCHES IT! Millimeters away from Cassie's temple. A stunned beat. 
      Everyone is frozen. Cassie's eyes shift from Buffy to the arrow and back 
      again. 
      <p>Then, with one hand, Buffy snaps the arrow in two. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>See? You can make a difference.</center>
<p>Cassie looks at Buffy She blinks, smiles: seeing something. 
      <p>
<center>CASSIE<br/>And you will.</center>
<p>And then Cassie touches her own heart. Her eyes go flat and she 
      collapses, falling into Buffy's arms. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Cassie! Cassie!</center>
<p>Cassie's eyes are still. Buffy cradles her in her lap, feels for her 
      pulse. Nothing. She's dead. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Cassie! No! Cassie, please...</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
      <p>The other side of the living room. The one we're used to seeing, with 
      the couch, etc. Buffy, Dawn, Xander and Willow sit in silence. Dawn's eyes 
      are red from crying. Buffy is stunned, full of self-loathing. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>How was her mother? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(almost toneless)<br/>Okay. As okay as... she said 
      their<br/>family had a history of heart<br/>irregularities... but that she 
      never<br/>told Cassie. Cassie didn't know that<br/>she had, a hole, a hole 
      in her heart. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Cassie didn't know? Then it was<br/>fate? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>She was going to die no matter what,<br/>wasn't she? No matter 
      what you did. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>She just knew. She was... special.<br/>And I failed her. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Buffy, you tried to help. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And I couldn't, I didn't.<br/>It's... there're all these kids, 
      you<br/>know, and they hurt so bad. I almost<br/>forgot, somehow, I almost 
      forgot how<br/>much high school hurts.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Dawn buries her head in her lap, starts to sob. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>She was my friend. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh, Dawnie, I'm so sorry. I failed<br/>for you too.</p></center>
<p>Dawn looks up, tears running down her face. Shakes her head. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Uh-uh. No. You didn't, 'cause you<br/>tried. You listened 
      and you tried.<br/>She died 'cause of her heart, not<br/>'cause of you She 
      was my friend<br/>'cause of you. I guess maybe<br/>sometimes you can't help. 

      <p>BUFFY<br/>So then what? What do you do when<br/>you know that? What do 
      you do when<br/>you know maybe you can't help?</p></center>
<p>A beat: as they all look at each other, unable to answer. 
      <p>INT. HALLWAY/BUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY Monday morning. A LONG SHOT. WE'RE IN 
      THE HALLWAY LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW TO BUFFY AT HER DESK. Her desk is a 
      mess. Slowly, she begins to straighten it. Organize her papers. Sharpen 
      her pencils. Readying to begin again. The camera doesn't move. 
      <p>
