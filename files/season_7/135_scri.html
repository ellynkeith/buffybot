<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
      <p>BUFFY and DAWN on the couch as GILES enters from the dining room. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Now, you're sure you'll all be all<br/>right here? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You'll only be gone for two days. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I think we've managed without you for<br/>a bit longer than 
      that.</p></p></center>
<p>Giles stops, looks at her. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Right. Well, thank goodness I<br/>needn't worry myself 
      with the idea of<br/>bad things happening in my absence.<br/>You getting 
      shot, for example. Or<br/>throwing everyone in the basement and<br/>trying 
      to kill them. Or Willow<br/>turning evil... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Oooh, don't forget, Anya turned evil,<br/>too.</p></center>
<p>Buffy turns, stares at Dawn. Not amused. And, back to Giles: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Okay, just leave. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(noticing)<br/>Dawn, Vi left her notebook there next<br/>to the 
      TV. Would you mind taking it<br/>out to her in the car? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Sure. 
      <p>GILES<br/>And maybe whack her in the head with<br/>it as a reminder not 
      to leave it<br/>lying all about? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>On it.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She leaves. Giles turns to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I'm a bit twitchy about leaving you<br/>alone again with 
      things in such a<br/>state of flux. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I know - but you should go. The<br/>girls need this trip to 
      understand<br/>the source of their power. And to<br/>know how to use it 
      right. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I don't think they appreciate the<br/>gravity of what we're 
      undertaking.<br/>How frightening and difficult it 
      is.<br/>(pointedly)<br/>Apparently somebody told them that<br/>the 
      visionquest consists of me taking<br/>them into the desert and doing 
      the<br/>hokey pokey until a "spooky rasta<br/>mama Slayer" appears and talks 
      to<br/>them in riddles. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(caught)<br/>That's not exactly the way I put it-</p></p></p></center>
<p>WILLOW comes down the stairs. Buffy changes the subject. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>(to Willow)<br/>How's Kennedy? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Still flu-ey. Bummed about missing<br/>the field trip. She 
      wants you to<br/>meditate extra hard for her. And<br/>maybe bring her back 
      s'mores. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(looking out to the<br/>driveway)<br/>Yes. S'mores. I'm going to 
      end up<br/>singing campfire songs, aren't I?</p></p></center>
<p>XANDER enters from the front door, followed by Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Giles, you might wanna get out there. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Oh, god, what... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Molly and Rona are fighting over who<br/>gets to drive the first 
      leg. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Betcha now you wish you'd renewed<br/>that California driver's 
      license.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Anya enters. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Rona won.<br/>(to Giles)<br/>You should probably let Molly 
      out of<br/>the trunk.</center>
<p>Giles simply shuts his eyes. A last moment of peace. 
      <p>He goes to the door, then turns back to look at the group. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Please be safe while I'm away.</center>
<p>We hear a loud HONK from outside. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Yes. You too.</center>
<p>He leaves. 
      <p>Willow, Dawn, Xander and Anya move into the living room, settling in, 
      as Buffy slowly moves away, heads to the basement. As she goes, we hear: 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (O.S.)<br/>I never actually realized just how<br/>compact Molly 
      really is. 
      <p>XANDER (O.S.)<br/>Plus, all that luggage back there.</p></center>
<p>Buffy gets to the basement door... 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY 
      <p>Basement door OPENS, light streams in. Buffy's at the top of the 
      stairs. She starts down... cautious... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike...?</center>
<p>As she comes down into the room, we see SPIKE in bed. Awake. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Yeah.</center>
<p>As we get closer, we see that he wears a SHACKLE on his wrist. CHAINED 
      to the wall. Not uncomfortably, but chained. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Giles is off. On the retreat.<br/>(not convincing)<br/>Said 
      to say goodbye. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Yeah, he's gonna miss me ever so.<br/>(beat)<br/>But gives us 
      all a breather, eh? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>From Giles? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>From the constant pitter-patter of<br/>clomping teenage girlie 
      feet. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(feigning innocence)<br/>I have no idea what you mean. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Oh, come off it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I enjoy my responsibilities as mentor<br/>and, and role model 
      and life guide<br/>and oh my god, I can't believe I have<br/>my bathroom 
      back for two whole days! 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>It's like a bloody war zone up there.<br/>And not in the fun 
      way.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy sits on the bed, dishing. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>And have you seen the kitchen since<br/>they got here? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(shakes his head)<br/>I'm just trying to stay out of 
      their<br/>way.</p></center>
<p>Buffy eyes the shackles. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I noticed. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>This is better, believe me. Safer. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay. But you've been fine. In<br/>close contact with the 
      girls. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>With you at my side, yeah. You'd<br/>never let me hurt one of 
      'em.<br/>(then)<br/>And that's how it's gonna be until<br/>we're sure The 
      First is done making<br/>me its bitch. We're together or I'm<br/>on the 
      leash. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So we find a way to make sure the<br/>trigger is deactivated. 
      We've got a<br/>couple of days. Lack of pitter-<br/>patter and all. Maybe- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Buffy...</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>But then he says nothing. She waits... and waits... and then: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Ow. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Ow? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/><u>Ow</u>. Ow!</p></p></p></center>
<p>He SLAMS back against the wall, clutching his head. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike? <u>Spike</u>?</center>
<p>A painful beat as he rides it out. He unclenches, catches his breath. 
      Sits up. Looks at her. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>I don't... god. Why would...</center>
<p>He SLAMS back again, harder this time, 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>AAAUUGGHH!!</center>
<p>He buries his face in his hands as Buffy jumps up. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What's happening, what are you --</center>
<p>Spike raises his head, looks at her. 
      <p>Blood is streaming out his nose, his eyes raw and bloodshot. Big-time 
      PAIN. 
      <p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT 
      <p>As Willow comes around the corner, carefully carrying a cup of tea, 
      Buffy comes up from the basement. She holds a bloody facecloth. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Hey. How is he?</center>
<p>Buffy shrugs. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>In the "goes" part of comes and goes. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>There seems to be a definite lack of<br/>screaming, that has 
      to be good. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You'd think...<br/>(re: tea)<br/>That for the other patient? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah. Thought I'd bring her some<br/>tea, help her feel 
      better. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(raising an eyebrow)<br/>Hmmm. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It's just tea.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She turns, starts heading to the stairs, when: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Will?</center>
<p>Willow turns back. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY(cont'd)<br/>How much do you know about the chip? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Spike's chip? Only the stuff I could<br/>dig up that hadn't 
      been buried by The<br/>Initiative. So, you know. About<br/>zero. Why? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's just... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You think this is chip-related?<br/>Buffy, did he try to -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No. No, no, he was fine. That's<br/>what's weird. He said it 
      felt like<br/>chip pain, but he wasn't... he didn't<br/>do anything. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>The chip is misfiring all on its own<br/>then.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy nods 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Well. This'll be fun. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. Imagine that. An ex of mine<br/>with a mysterious, 
      pain-inducing<br/>problem. Remember when things used<br/>to be nice and 
      boring? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No.</p></p></center>
<p>As they both turn to go, BUFFY calls over her shoulder. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Have fun delivering the tea. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Okay, not when you make it sound all<br/>dirty like 
      that.</p></center>
<p>As she goes upstairs: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>It's just tea.</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - WILLOW'S ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>We hear a gentle KNOCK, then the door opens, Willow enters, tea still 
      in hand. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Hey, I figured the best thing for a<br/>cold was probably 
      a nice, hot cup<br/>of... boots.</center>
<p>And we see now that KENNEDY sits on the edge of the bed, dressed for 
      clubbing, just about finished lacing up a pair of cool, dressy boots. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Hey. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>For someone who's sick, you look<br/>surprisingly robust. And 
      casual-<br/>dressy. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Well, the lighting in here is good,<br/>maybe it's just -- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You were never sick.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Kennedy pauses for a minute, weighing. Then: 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>No. I was never sick. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh! You are so busted, Xander's<br/>gonna hafta drive you to 
      the desert<br/>now -- 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Willow. Chill. There's a reason I<br/>didn't go. I have a 
      thing. A<br/>separate thing. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What... 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Something's coming down. I've got my<br/>own mission. And I 
      need your help.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>SMASH TO: 
      <p>INT. BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow and Kennedy sit at a bar table. Music, lights, dancing: Willow 
      watches the whole thing. 
      <p>Then she looks at the table, we see two big, tourist-y, very alcoholic 
      drinks. Complete with little paper umbrellas. 
      <p>She looks at Kennedy. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/><u>This</u> is a mission? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>(grinning)<br/>Oh, yeah. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>And, I guess the little paper<br/>umbrellas in the drinks are, 
      what, a<br/>signal for... we're not on a mission,<br/>are we? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Hey, trust me. I told you, I have a<br/>thing. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No, this is a fun thing, I've done<br/>this thing! 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Well, yeah, in like l954.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow just stares at Kennedy for a beat, then she gets up to go. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>Come on, come on, just hang out with<br/>me a 
      little.</center>
<p>Willow hesitates. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>You're sexy when you pout.</center>
<p>Willow stops, looks at Kennedy. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Why do you do that? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>To get you to stay.</p></center>
<p>Willow looks perplexed, overwhelmed... but she does come back. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I will stay for one drink. Just to<br/>keep you company. 
      Then I'm going<br/>home.</center>
<p>As she sits: 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Okay, one drink. I can work with<br/>that. Let's start 
      with the easy<br/>stuff. How long have you known?</center>
<p>Willow doesn't get it. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>That you were gay? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Wait, wait, <u>that's</u> easy? And, hey,<br/>you just assume 
      that I'm... that I'm<br/>gay? I mean, presume much? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Okay, sorry.<br/>(serious)<br/>How long have you enjoyed 
      having sex<br/>with women? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Hey! What do you think, you have<br/>some kind of, like, 
      special lesbi-dar<br/>or something?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Kennedy just stares at Willow for a beat. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Okay, you know there's a better word<br/>for that, 
      right?<br/>(beat)<br/>You really haven't been getting out<br/>there that 
      much, have you?</center>
<p>Willow looks down at her drink. Embarrassed. Serious. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I just... what, can you always tell?<br/>Just from 
      looking at someone? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>No. No, of course not. That<br/>wouldn't be any fun.</p></center>
<p>Willow looks up. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>The fun part is the process. Of<br/>getting to 
      know a girl. It's like...<br/>it's like flirting in code.</center>
<p>She looks into Willow's eyes. A little smoldery. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>It's using body language and laughing<br/>at 
      the right jokes and.. and looking<br/>into her eyes and knowing she's 
      still<br/>whispering to you, even when she's<br/>not saying a word.</center>
<p>Willow's caught. A little mesmerized. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>And that sense that, if you could<br/>just 
      touch her, just once, everything<br/>would be okay. For both of 
      you.<br/>That's how you can tell.</center>
<p>There's a moment here, a real connection. Then. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>Or if she's really hot, you just get<br/>her 
      drunk, see if she comes on to you.</center>
<p>Willow blushes a little more. Takes a breath, then: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Three years ago. That's when I knew.<br/>And it wasn't 
      women. It was woman.<br/>Just one.</center>
<p>Kennedy nods. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Lucky woman.</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE BASEMENT - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy's coming down the stairs, holding a clean towel. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>So, I had to dig a little bit for a<br/>clean towel, seems 
      we've completely<br/>lost control of --</center>
<p>She sees Spike, breathing hard, slumped against the wall, head in his 
      hands. Looking bad. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>-- the towel... 
      organizing...<br/>system...<br/>(tender)<br/>Spike?</center>
<p>She comes to him, he lifts his head. He's clammy, bleeding profusely 
      now. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Popped another blood vessel, I think.</center>
<p>She hands him the towel. He begins wiping the blood from his face. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>There must be a reason why the chip<br/>is going all wonky 
      now, maybe it's<br/>related to the trigger, or it's,<br/>like, interference 
      from the new soul<br/>thing, or -- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Or maybe I just wasn't supposed to<br/>last this long.</p></center>
<p>They take a beat, letting that sink in. Then. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>One more thing you and I have in<br/>common, eh, 
      pet? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay. Okay, well, we'll fix it.<br/>We'll get the gang on it, 
      we'll hit<br/>serious research mode -- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Good. Try "behavioral modification<br/>software through the 
      ages."</p></p></center>
<p>She looks at him, studying him. Trying to figure out what to do. Then: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You're right, it's not a book thing.<br/>(idea)<br/>It's a 
      phone thing. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Who you gonna call? God, that phrase<br/>is never gonna be 
      usable again, is it? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Doubt it. Hang tight.</p></p></center>
<p>She heads up. 
      <p>INT. BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>We find Willow and Kennedy still at the table -- each has a couple of 
      empty glasses in front of her. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>It was Gone With the Wind. I saw<br/>that, and I knew I 
      wanted to sweep<br/>Scarlett off her feet. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You were five. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>I'm not saying the sweeping would<br/>have been 
easy.</p></p></center>
<p>Willow just kind of stares at Kennedy. Studying her. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>What? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No, it's just... I still can't figure<br/>it out. Why you... 
      like me. You<br/>don't even know me. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>What, are you fishing for compliments<br/>now? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No! I -- 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>(she was kidding)<br/>Willow.<br/>(serious)<br/>I don't know. 
      Have you seen you?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow shifts -- she's not used to those compliments. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>And we like the same things. Italian.<br/>Skate 
      punk. Robert Parker mysteries.<br/>Fighting evil.</center>
<p>Willow grins. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I don't like any of those things.<br/>Except the fighting 
      evil part. And<br/>even then I'd prefer a nice foot<br/>massage. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Okay... I dig the way you always turn<br/>off the Moulin 
      Rouge DVD at chapter<br/>32 so it has a happy ending.<br/>(becoming 
      serious)<br/>I like the way you speak. It's<br/>interesting. And your 
      freckles.<br/>Lickable.<br/>(then)<br/>I'm not so into the magic 
      stuff.<br/>Seems like fairy tale crap to me.<br/>But it matters to you. You 
      care<br/>about it. So it's cool.</p></center>
<p>Willow looks down. Bashful. But enjoying this. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>(changing the subject)<br/>Did your parents freak out? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Not as bad as they did when my<br/>Watcher showed up. Now 
      <u>that</u> was a<br/>blowout... but the gay thing...<br/>they're pretty 
      cool about me being<br/>me. Besides, my brother's a vegan,<br/>so he takes 
      most of the heat.</p></center>
<p>A beat. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>What about you? Do your parents know? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah. My mom was all proud, 'cause<br/>she thought I was 
      making a political<br/>statement. Then the statement mojo<br/>wore off, and 
      I was just gay... she<br/>hardly ever even met Tara. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Classic.</p></p></center>
<p>Willow gets very quiet. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I didn't mind. Tara and I are sort<br/>of... private. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>I'm sorry. It must have be- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(cutting her off at<br/>"must have")<br/>Were, I mean. 
      Private.</p></p></center>
<p>Well. That was awkward. Willow takes a drink... 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/FOYER - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike on the stairs. Looking PAINED. But not because of the chip. 
      <p>As Buffy, on the phone in the living room, comes into frame: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Yes. Agent Finn. Riley. Tell him<br/>we're having a 
      problem with Spike's<br/>chip.<br/>(beat)<br/>No, his 
      chip.<br/>(beat)<br/>Spike. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Listen, pet... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, Finn's his last --<br/>(beat)<br/>Well, did he used to 
      work there, did<br/>he get transferred recently, or...<br/>(beat)<br/>Oh. 
      Okay.</p></p></center>
<p>Spike puts his head in his hands, in actual chip pain again. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Okay, is this actually a flower shop,<br/>or is 
      this one of those things where<br/>I'm supposed to play along to show 
      I<br/>know it's really Secret Ops?</center>
<p>Spike looks up, trying to ride out the pain. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Wait, should I not have said 
      that?<br/>(beat)<br/>Okay, well, I guess... if some guy<br/>named Finn shows 
      up to buy flowers...<br/>right. Thanks.</center>
<p>She hangs up, turns to look at Spike. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Wrong number. Or a giant 
      government<br/>conspiracy. One of those -- hey.<br/>Did it happen again? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>This one seemed easier than the<br/>others. See? Probably just 
      gonna<br/>fade...</p></center>
<p>He clenches his jaw, feeling something. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>...right away...</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - WILLOW'S ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>The door opens, light comes in from the hall. We see Willow and Kennedy 
      in the doorway. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Well. This is my stop.</center>
<p>She hits the LIGHTS, enters. Kennedy follows. Watches her. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>So.</center>
<p>They both kind of stand there. Nodding. Awkward. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Glad we talked. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Yes. Kinda cleared the air, huh? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Totally. Air, cleared. Check. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>You know, in the spirit of air-<br/>clearing... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>I feel like I need to be honest about<br/>something. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(worried)<br/>Oh. Is something... 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>No, no, it's just. I think you<br/>should know...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She leans in and slowly, tenderly KISSES Willow. On the lips. Willow is 
      surprised, but then we watch her give in, kiss Kennedy back. 
      <p>We pull around, letting the moment linger, moving in close on Kennedy 
      as she slowly, reluctantly ends the kiss, pulls back... 
      <p>
<center>WARREN (O.S.)<br/>Well. That was nice.</center>
<p>Kennedy's eyes fly open as she realizes: 
      <p>Willow has turned into WARREN.

      <p>Kennedy stumbles backward, awkward, knocking over a lamp. Stares at 
      this guy standing there where Willow was. 
      <p>The first person we see standing opposite Kennedy, though, is Willow. 
      Then, as Willow talks, when we switch to Kennedy's POV, we'll see Warren 
      talking to Kennedy. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Okay, you all right? Not used to<br/>literally knocking 
      girls off their<br/>feet with just the power of my lips.</center>
<p>Kennedy doesn't move, doesn't react. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Okay. So, you gonna pick that up,<br/>or... 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>I don't... what are you... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(getting self-<br/>conscious)<br/>Is this another freckle 
      thing,<br/>'cause --</p></p></center>
<p>She moves to the mirror, sees her reflection: Warren. She sucks in her 
      breath, horrified. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Oh. Oh god. Oh god, no.</center>
<p>She touches her face, unable to pull her eyes away from the mirror. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>What is that?</center>
<p>A beat as Willow just keeps staring at her face, terror- stricken. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>It's the man I killed.</center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>[Note: From here on out, unless otherwise noted, we will shoot all 
      Willow scenes twice, once with Willow and once with Warren, and then put 
      the scenes together in editing.] 
      <p>Willow comes TEARING down the stairs, followed closely by Kennedy. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Okay, hold up a sec...</center>
<p>We see Xander, Anya and Dawn in the living room as Willow runs in, 
      stands right in front of them. Stops. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Guys.</center>
<p>The second they see her, they're up on their feet, backing away. Things 
      should move here at a quick, chaotic clip Think Sorkin-esque. Without the 
      fainting. Well, actually, we have that, too. See below. 
      <p>Xander grabs Dawn, puts her behind him. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(to Kennedy)<br/>Get Buffy! Get Buffy! Tell her 
      The<br/>First is back! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What? No, I'm not The First -- 
      <p>ANYA<br/>We're not interested in your evil<br/>lies. We've heard them 
      all. Well,<br/>they have, you didn't actually visit<br/>me with lies. But I 
      heard about it!<br/>(to Kennedy)<br/>Buffy! Basement! Go! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm me. I'm Willow. Guys, come on.<br/>Ask Kennedy, she was 
      there.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Scared, the others look to Kennedy. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>I don't know, I'm not sure.<br/>(thinking)<br/>We were up 
      in Willow's room, and we<br/>were- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Okay, no! Don't ask Kennedy. Wrong.<br/>No Kennedy-asking. 
      Let's try another<br/>approach...</p></center>
<p>ANDREW has entered from the dining room, holding a plate of pumpkin 
      pie, raising a fork to his mouth. 
      <p>He sees Willow (to him it's Warren.) And he drops the plate. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>No. No, no, no, you're back... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No, I'm not. <u>It's</u>. Not. I'm not<br/>it! Listen to me -- 

      <p>ANDREW<br/>(to Willow)<br/>No, no more listening! I know who<br/>you are 
      now. I know what you made me<br/>do. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Just... what the hell is going on? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(ignoring her)<br/>Your promises of happy fields 
      and<br/>dancing schnauzers and being demigods<br/>won't work on me 
      anymore.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>As Xander, Anya, Dawn and Andrew move in, defensively surrounding 
      Willow in the living room. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>(calling out)<br/><u>Buffy</u>! 
      <p>XANDER<br/>There're probably Bringers coming, we<br/>have to -- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm not The First. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>You made me do things. Things I<br/>can't take back. Ever. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm not The First! 
      <p>BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>What's --</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>We see her enter from the basement, see Willow. 
      <p>In a flash, Buffy runs to Willow, PUNCHES her in the face, knocks her 
      down. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW/BUFFY<br/>Ow!</center>
<p>Meanwhile, behind them, Spike comes out of the basement, staggering, 
      having another attack. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Buffy... 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(not seeing him/re:<br/>punch)<br/>Wait...</p></center>
<p>No one takes their eyes off Willow. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>But if he's The First...</center>
<p>Willow turns to Dawn, her back to Andrew. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I'm not The First! 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(accusatory)<br/>You're not The First! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(frustrated)<br/>I know!!!</p></p></center>
<p>Andrew reacts, looks at Willow. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Oh my god.</center>
<p>A smile breaks out on his face. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>You're back!</center>
<p>And he runs, LEAPS on Willow, grabbing her from behind in a HUGE BEAR 
      HUG, reaching his arms around to what he thinks is Warren's chest. 
      <p>From Willow's perspective, she's getting felt up by Andrew. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Hey! Bad touching.</center>
<p>Behind them, Spike has staggered into frame, unnoticed in the 
      commotion. We see, though no one else does, as he grabs his head and falls 
      to the floor. 
      <p>Unaware, Willow shakes Andrew off. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Could everyone just stop, it's me!</center>
<p>The group stands around her, nonplussed. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>(quietly)<br/>It's Willow. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm Willow.</p></center>
<p>They all lean in a bit. Xander squints: 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Are you sure? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You know, there are other stories<br/>from kindergarten, 
      non-yellow-crayon<br/>stories, in which you don't come out<br/>in such a 
      good light. An incident<br/>involving Aquaman Underoos, for<br/>example. 
      Want me to start talkin'? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Hey! Willow!</p></p></center>
<p>Everyone relaxes, moves forward a bit. Except Andrew, who tries to hide 
      his disappointment. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What happened? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don't know. We were... we were<br/>there. And then I looked 
      like him. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Like a glamour. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Maybe. I probably brought it on<br/>myself.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Andrew starts gently poking at Willow's face. Testing it. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What makes you think that? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Wouldn't be the first time. I kinda<br/>have a history with my 
      witchy<br/>subconscious making things go<br/>kerfloofy. Remember the wacky 
      "I<br/>can't see you, you can't see me"<br/>spell?<br/>(miserable)<br/>Hijinks 
      ensued.</p></center>
<p>Dawn starts poking Willow, too. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Guys. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>It's so real... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>All too aware.</p></p></center>
<p>They stop poking her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Say you're right. You did this to<br/>yourself. Why would 
      your<br/>subconscious turn you into Warren? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well, obviously because I... feel<br/>bad. About... killing 
      him. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Got it. So we'll deal. We'll help. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No. I can handle this. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>On your own? Why? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I did it. I'll fix it. And I don't<br/>want you seeing me this 
      way. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Kinda too late, Will.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike GROANS, coming to. Willow looks over at him. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Seriously, I'm not posing any big<br/>threat to the 
      world. And it looks<br/>like you've got your hands 
full<br/>already.</center>
<p>Buffy sees Spike on the floor, goes to him quickly, sees he's awake. 
      Torn, she looks at Willow. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I'll be back before you even know I'm<br/>gone. 
      Promise.</center>
<p>She and Buffy exchange a look. Buffy nods, and Willow goes to the door 
      and leaves. Kennedy watches her go. 
      <p>With the remaining others watching her, Buffy turns to Spike, crouches 
      next to him. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Buffy... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm right here.</p></center>
<p>He sits up, still woozy. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Chip fired again. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Kinda figured.</p></center>
<p>As the scene continues, Kennedy slips away, to the dining room and 
      kitchen -- headed for the back door... 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(more to Buffy than<br/>Spike)<br/>What do you need? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Just gimme some space. I'm gonna be<br/>fine. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>These things are getting worse, not<br/>better. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I know.</p></p></p></center>
<p>He looks up, realizes everyone is there, looking at him. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>(pissed)<br/>Comfy, all? Come to watch the 
      Spike<br/>Show? Why not sell tickets, make<br/>yourselves some cash. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(excited)<br/>Oooh!<br/>(covering)<br/>That was a joke! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Maybe they'll call back. Send help. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Maybe we can't wait.</p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT. UC SUNNYDALE CAMPUS - NIGHT 
      <p>The campus is deserted, there's no one around this late. Except Willow. 
      We find her walking swiftly. With purpose. And SCARED. She looks around, 
      nervous, moves forward... 
      <p>...just as Kennedy steps into her path. 
      <p>Willow jumps, emitting a startled SQUEAK. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Okay, safe to say no one will ever<br/>accuse you of 
      being too butch.</center>
<p>Willow settles, keeps walking. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Kennedy, go home.</center>
<p>But Kennedy follows right behind, keeping up. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Come on. You turned into a guy! If<br/>you take a step 
      back, seriously,<br/>there's a certain element of humor<br/>here, 
      right?</center>
<p>Willow stops, turns, looks at her. Not buying it. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>A really, really big step. Like a...<br/>giant 
      leap kinda thing.</center>
<p>They both keep walking, together now. A bit slower. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I killed him. It's hard to see the<br/>chuckles.</center>
<p>Silence for a beat. Kennedy tries another approach: 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>So, you got a plan? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yup. Gonna get some help reversing<br/>it. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>I thought you were gonna try it<br/>yourself -- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I did try. Didn't work.<br/>Something's... blocking me. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>All the more reason for me to go with<br/>you. Plus, I was 
      there with you when<br/>it happened. Let me come and try to<br/>help, too. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I really think I'm fine with the<br/>handling. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>By yourself? Why? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well, see above re; I'm the one who<br/>killed him.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She looks like she's going to say more, wants to, even. Then: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>It's hard to understand. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Given. How about if I just tag along<br/>anyway? Keep you 
      company.</p></center>
<p>After a beat: 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>I'm taking that as a yes, you know.</center>
<p>Willow walks on for a moment in silence, then: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Fine. Come.</center>
<p>Kennedy smiles to herself. Victory. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Just try not to get in the way. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>You know where you're going? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>To find some old friends of mine.<br/>Been awhile, but maybe 
      they can help.</p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander, Anya and Dawn in the living room -- Andrew's with them, sacked 
      out on the floor. He's totally wiped out. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Okay, are things always that wackadoo<br/>around here? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Ha! Newbie. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I don't know what things are like in<br/>Houses of Evil, my 
      young friend, but<br/>around here, that was kind of nothing. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Really? 'Cause it seemed like a lot<br/>was happening all at 
      once. You guys<br/>aren't wicked exhausted? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You sat around and watched bad things<br/>happen to other 
      people. That's<br/>exhausting? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I'm very sensitive to the emotional<br/>pain of others, I 
      found it draining.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>The phone RINGS. Andrew gets a burst of energy, jumps for it. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>I'll get it! 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I thought you were exhausted -- 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I'm supposed to get a call when the<br/>new League of 
      Extraordinary Gentlemen<br/>comes in. I gave them this number.</p></p></center>
<p>He goes to the phone, picks it up. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(to Andrew)<br/>Oh, see if you can get two -- Loser. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Summers' residence, this is Andrew<br/>speaking, how can I 
      help you?</p></center>
<p>Andrew puts his hand over the receiver, talks to the group. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>Hey, do we know some British guy<br/>named 
      Robson?</center>
<p>TIME JUMP TO: 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander's hand REPLACING the phone into its cradle. He looks at the 
      others, serious: 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(stunned)<br/>He was attacked. This guy Robson. 
      In<br/>England. Giles was there, helping<br/>him, and there was a 
      Bringer...</center>
<p>He trails off. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Xander. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Robson blacked out. Last thing he<br/>remembers, Giles' head 
      was about to<br/>get real familiar with the Bringer's<br/>very sharp axe. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Oh my god. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Giles never mentioned any of this. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Robson said that by the time he came<br/>to, no 
Giles.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They take a beat, unwilling to go any further. Until: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>So what are we saying... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Maybe Giles just didn't want to talk<br/>about it. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Or maybe he didn't make it.</p></p></center>
<p>They look at her. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>I'm not saying it's a happy scenario.<br/>But 
      we're dealing with a Big Bad that<br/>can be any dead person it wants. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Because if you wanted to infiltrate<br/>the inner circle of 
      the Slayer... 
      <p>ANYA<br/>You become the one person she trusts<br/>more than anyone else. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(thinking)<br/>But there's no way we can know... 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Actually, that's not true.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They all turn and look at him. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>The First can't take corporeal form.<br/>So it 
      can't touch anything. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Well, it's not like Giles hasn't<br/>touched anything... 
      right?</p></center>
<p>We watch as they all go over the last couple of weeks in their heads. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>Has anybody seen Giles touch anything<br/>since he 
      came back? Hold anything?<br/>Has anybody hugged 
      him?<br/>(serious/scared)<br/>Think very hard.</center>
<p>Xander, Anya and Dawn take a beat, exchange a look. Then they get up 
      and head for the door. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Where are you -- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Desert. We're gonna find Giles. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Oh, good, lemme just get some tapes<br/>for the car, I've been 
      working on<br/>this mix -- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You're not coming. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>What? Why? 'Cause I used to be evil? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Well, actually, no, 'cause you're<br/>annoying, but, yeah, 
      that's a good<br/>reason, too. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Wait, don't leave me here all alone,<br/>I keep getting 
      attacked in this house. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Actually, Xand... 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>What if this is all part of the plan,<br/>drive you away so it 
      can have its way<br/>with me, ever think of that? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I'll risk it. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Okay, well, if you leave me here<br/>alone, I'll do something 
      evil.<br/>(searching)<br/>Like... burning something. Or gluing<br/>things 
      together. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>For crying out loud, Harris, just<br/>take him. Least we can 
      keep an eye<br/>on him.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander exhales, heavy. Resigned, he opens the door. Andrew jumps up, 
      runs out the door, followed by Dawn. Anya stops, speaks quietly: 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>Xander... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I know. They're out there alone with<br/>him. All of 
      them.</p></center>
<p>They leave, shutting the door behind them... 
      <p>EXT. DESERT - CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 
      <p>Giles, sitting alone near the fire. The Potentials must be all tucked 
      away in their sleeping bags elsewhere... we certainly don't see them 
      here... just Giles. Staring into the fire... 
      <p>INT. UC SUNNYDALE CAMPUS - COVEN MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>A circle of FIVE YOUNG WITCHES (four young women and one young man), 
      seated on the floor, eyes closed. Holding hands. 
      <p>Bundles of sage burn around the room. Each young witch wears A CRYSTAL 
      around her neck. VAUGHNE, the Alpha Witch here, chants: 
      <p>
<center>VAUGHNE<br/>Instill us, O Great One, with peace,<br/>with strength, 
      with compassion, with<br/>hope.</center>
<p>The crystals all begin to GLOW. 
      <p>
<center>VAUGHNE (cont'd)<br/>The path we seek is yours...</center>
<p>The glow from the crystals grows more intense. 
      <p>
<center>VAUGHNE (cont'd)<br/>Keep us on the path.</center>
<p>The glow now moves beyond the crystals, bathing the witches in a warm, 
      soothing, tranquil LIGHT. After a moment, the light fades, and they all 
      open their eyes, calm, refreshed. 
      <p>We see Willow and Kennedy in the doorway. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Okay, that's new.</center>
<p>The group looks up, sees the visitors. 
      <p>
<center>VAUGHNE<br/>Um, hi, we're... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh. Hey. I'm sorry. Willow. We<br/>actually met when I was a 
      freshman.<br/>And, also, not a boy.<br/>(beat)<br/>This is Kennedy. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Hey. 
      <p>VAUGHNE<br/>(squinting)<br/>You're Willow? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She tries for casual: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Wow. Look at you guys. Campus<br/>Wiccans. Guess 
      you got past that<br/>whole bake sale phase. 
      <p>VAUGHNE<br/>No, we still do those, too, second<br/>Tuesday of every 
      month, I'm sorry,<br/>I'm just having a hard time with the<br/>whole guy of 
      it -- 
      <p>AMY (O.S.)<br/>Um... it's actually her.</p></p></center>
<p>And here we realize that one of the young women in the group is AMY. 
      Looking a lot less-strung-out than the last time we saw her. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>I can tell.</center>
<p>She stands, looks at Willow. 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>I know her.</center>
<p>Willow takes a step back, defensive. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Okay, whoa.</center>
<p>Amy steps back, too, a bit jittery. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>(to Willow)<br/>Um... okay. Here's the thing. Hi.<br/>Here's 
      the thing, let's get this out<br/>of the way, I'm sorta screwed 
up.</center>
<p>Kennedy looks at Willow: <u>this</u> is where you wanted to come for 
      help? 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>I mean, you already know that, you<br/>lived it, 
      gotcha. 
      <p>VAUGHNE<br/>But she's doing so much better.<br/>(sympathetic)<br/>Amy... 
      <p>AMY<br/>(to Vaughne)<br/>Vaughne, it's okay, I wanna do this.<br/>(to 
      Willow)<br/>It took me a while to really see<br/>myself. But I did.</p></p></center>
<p>She takes a step closer to Willow, hesitant. 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>'Cause, you know... that's the fun<br/>part of 
      hitting rock bottom! You get<br/>to relive all the crappy things 
      you<br/>did.</center>
<p>She steps back again, obviously reconsidering the close thing. 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>And I wanted to come find you And<br/>tell you. 
      That I was here, working<br/>on stuff with these guys. They're<br/>good. And 
      I was sorry. But now you<br/>showed up. Looking like...</center>
<p>She tilts her head, looks at Willow. Seems to realize: 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>Wow. How'd this happen?</center>
<p>Willow is kind of stunned, so: 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>That's what we're here to find out.<br/>(looking at 
      Willow)<br/>I mean, if we're done with all the<br/>group hugging.</center>
<p>Willow, still wary of Amy, starts in: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I got hit with this, like, glamour.<br/>And I can't seem 
      to shake it myself.</center>
<p>Amy, Vaughne and the other young witches nervously look at each other. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I was hoping someone here might be<br/>able to 
      help. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Yeah, the thing is, we're mostly<br/>about healing spirits and 
      nurturing<br/>our life force here. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(disappointed)<br/>Oh. 
      <p>AMY<br/>But we'll try.</p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT. UC SUNNYDALE CAMPUS - INITIATIVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
      <p>We see the familiar bushes and shrubs that hide the entrance to The 
      Initiative. It looks like nothing's changed. 
      <p>Two sets of feet -- Buffy's and Spike's -- approach. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Guess here we are. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yup. Here are we.</p></center>
<p>We see them look at each other. Spike's holding up well, putting up a 
      brave front, but he's getting worse -- skin's paler, eyes more deeply sunk 
      into his head. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You sure you still wanna go back in<br/>this place with 
      me? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(shrugging)<br/>Eh. Nothing good on TV tonight.</p></center>
<p>Spike nods. They get down on all fours, start pulling bushes aside, 
      tearing up the dirt. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You think the stuff's still good? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Dunno. Worked pretty good when I was<br/>living in residence 
      here. Any time<br/>I got a little... rambunctious, the<br/>chip would kick 
      in, I'd feel like my<br/>head was gonna explode, they'd dope<br/>me up, and 
      everything would be all<br/>daffodils and teddy bears. For a<br/>couple 
      hours, anyway. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm... maybe we should look around<br/>for files and stuff, 
      too. We can<br/>learn about the chip, its shelf life. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I'll take whatever we can get.</p></p></p></center>
<p>She's hit a metal grate in the dirt. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Ready?</center>
<p>Spike nods. She pulls the grate -- hard -- and it comes up, spraying 
      dirt all around. 
      <p>INT. UC SUNNYDALE CAMPUS - COVEN MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Amy sits in the center of the room, cross-legged. Willow sits across 
      from her, holding a small, smooth STONE in her hands. Both have their eyes 
      closed. 
      <p>To the side, the other young witches of the coven stand and watch. 
      Nearby, but a bit removed, Kennedy stands too. 
      <p>As Amy chants, Kennedy leans over to Vaughne. 
      <p>

<p>Clearly, Kennedy does not. Resigned, she watches as... 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>(chanting)<br/>Give back the form the soul requires,<br/>see 
      that the balance is put right.</center>
<p>Amy's crystal, still around her neck, GLOWS. The stone in Willow's hand 
      glows, too, turns orange, then red... 
      <p>Willow's eyes FLY OPEN, she DROPS the stone. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>(in pain)<br/>Aaaauuugghh!!</center>
<p>She jumps up, Amy following. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>It didn't work?</center>
<p>Willow, enraged, in pain, SLAPS Amy across the face as: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>No, it didn't, you dumb bitch.</center>
<p>Willow rubs her still-burning hand, then slowly becomes aware that 
      everyone in the room -- including Kennedy -- is staring at her. Stunned. 
      <p>Willow actually looks a little stunned herself. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Willow.</center>
<p>Willow rubs her smarting hand as Amy lightly touches her stinging 
      cheek. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>You... you slapped me. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No. I, I didn't. It wasn't me.</p></center>
<p>We are definitely seeing Willow now she looks positively terrified. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>It was Warren.</center>

      ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Where we left off: Willow, speechless, faces a stunned room. 
      <p>She turns and runs out the door. 
      <p>INT. UC SUNNYDALE CAMPUS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>As Willow takes off down the hall, Kennedy rounds the corner, trying to 
      catch up. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Willow! Willow!</center>
<p>Willow turns, faces her. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>Okay. You're upset. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Upset? <u>Upset</u>?!? Are you just tuning<br/>in, did you not 
      see that? I'm<br/>turning into him. It's not a trick,<br/>it's not a 
      glamour, I'm <u>becoming</u> him.<br/>A murderous, misogynist <u>man</u>. 
      Do you<br/>understand what he did? What I could<br/>do? I killed him for a 
      <u>reason</u>. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Getting angry isn't helping. We can<br/>still try to- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You understand nothing about magic.<br/>And in case you didn't 
      notice, our<br/>"date" is over.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow walks away. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Willow --</center>
<p>Willow casually WAVES her hand and, behind her, Kennedy runs smack into 
      a MAGIC BARRIER. Kennedy can't follow anymore. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>Willow, come on. Willow! Wait!</center>
<p>But Willow's out the door. Kennedy can only watch helplessly through 
      the door's window as Willow picks up her pace, starts running, taking off 
      into the night... 
      <p>INT. INITIATIVE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
      <p>Dark. What little we see of the place is claustrophobic. Cluttered. 
      Threatening. 
      <p>Chunks of concrete crumble down from above, SLAM to the floor. A beat 
      later, two shadowy figures -- Buffy and Spike -- drop from the ceiling. 
      <p>Two FLASHLIGHTS pierce the black. We still don't see much -- lots of 
      cobwebs and dust and overturned equipment. 
      <p>Buffy and Spike react to the smell -- the smell of dead bodies left for 
      three-plus years. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh god. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Yeah. You never really get used to<br/>that smell, do 
      you?</p></center>
<p>As they move, Buffy's foot THUMPS against something on the floor. She 
      shines her flashlight down at her feet, where we see: 
      <p>A hideously deformed, rotting DEMON BODY. Twisted by death, its face 
      turned toward us. Buffy looks into its vacant, staring EYE SOCKETS. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Guess not. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Buffy.</p></center>
<p>She looks up and sees, as do we, Spike's flashlight traveling beyond 
      the dead demon, revealing... 
      <p>More DEAD BODIES. Three demons, six humans in military uniforms. All 
      decomposing. Scattered carelessly about. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Casualties in Adam's final battle<br/>here. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>They just sealed the place off. Left<br/>everything as it was. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm thinking brief stay. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Yeah, you're not wrong.</p></p></p></center>
<p>He moves forward, stepping around the demon body. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>I think I can get us to the med lab,<br/>find the 
      drug.</center>
<p>As they move away, their backs to us... 
      <p>Like a JOLT, we see something run across frame, behind their backs, 
      dark. Dangerous. 
      <p>They keep walking forward, totally unaware... 
      <p>INT. XANDER'S CAR - NIGHT 
      <p>Speeding to the desert. Xander and Anya in the front, Dawn and Andrew 
      in the back. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Okay. I'll go. R.</center>
<p>Silence as the others remain lost in thought, worried. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>Ghost is hard to play by yourself. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(to Xander)<br/>How long since they left? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Few hours. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>If it's The First -- and I'm not<br/>saying it is, 
      but...<br/>(beat)<br/>What are we expecting to find? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You've got a group of Slayers-in-<br/>training stranded out in 
      the middle<br/>of the desert... 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You didn't bring 'em out there to<br/>meditate.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They take a beat, the horrifying possibilities hanging there. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>Kinda makes you grateful you're not<br/>a 
      Potential after all, doesn't it.<br/>Safer. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Yeah, well, not so fast with the big<br/>whew. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(getting it)<br/>He might know we're coming. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Which means we're already too late,<br/>we're heading out to the 
      middle of<br/>nowhere -- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>With no Slayer, no powerful witch... 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Just a teenager, a powerless former<br/>demon and two big 
      geeks.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>No one argues with her characterization of the group. 
      <p>Beat. Then: 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>Okay. License plate game, maybe?</center>
<p>EXT. SUNNYDALE STREETS - ALLEY - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow runs into the alley, out of breath, spent. She leans against the 
      wall, tries to steel herself, but just ends up... breaking into tiny, 
      pitiful sobs. 
      <p>She lowers herself to the ground, sits on her knees on the pavement, 
      crying quietly. Small. Alone. Lost. 
      <p>And then, after a beat of this, she seems to run out of sobs. The 
      crying subsides, she tries to catch her breath. As she wipes her tears 
      away, smiling bitterly: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Look at me. Crying like a girl.</center>
<p>She stands, looks around. A look crosses her face: determination. She's 
      had an idea. She knows what to do. 
      <p>She walks away. Calm. 
      <p>INT. INITIATIVE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and Spike still moving forward, cautious. Off to the side, we 
      hear a WHOOSH. They freeze, tense up. 
      <p>We come around as they go back-to-back, scanning the room, very still, 
      very calm. Their voices tight and under control: 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You hear that? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yup. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Think something survived? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Looks like. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You see where? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No. Sounded like it was over there...</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She waves her flashlight back and forth in the area, but there's 
      nothing but dusty, crumbling wall. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Whatever it was, it's not --</center>
<p>Then we hear it again, off to the side: WHOOSH. 
      <p>Buffy and Spike, as one, suddenly WHIP around and aim their flashlights 
      back toward the noise. Nothing. 
      <p>They're tense. Out of breath. Listening. Waiting... 
      <p>The same dark, almost shadow-like thing (we barely see it) CAREENS into 
      Buffy from the side, knocks her off her feet. 
      <p>Her flashlight goes SKITTERING across the floor. Spike whips back 
      around, dives after the monster... 
      <p>INT. UC SUNNYDALE CAMPUS - COVEN MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Kennedy walks back in, we see Amy still there. Just Amy. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Where'd they go? 
      <p>AMY<br/>Took off. That was a little too<br/>creepy. Even for us.</p></center>
<p>As Kennedy distractedly looks back to the door, Amy watches. Realizes 
      it's more-than-just-friendly. 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>You're really worried about her,<br/>aren't 
      you?</center>
<p>Kennedy doesn't answer, stays focused on the door... 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>She's gonna be fine. Really. She's<br/>good at 
      this. She's strong, and<br/>she's dealt with a lot worse, long<br/>before 
      she ever went out and found<br/>herself a big ol' Potential 
      Slayer<br/>bodyguard, okay?</center>
<p>Kennedy turns back from the door. Stares at Amy for a beat. 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>Just have a little faith in her. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>I never said I was a Potential Slayer. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Oh. No, I think you did, when you<br/>guys first showed up, you 
      told us -- 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>No. I didn't.</p></p></p></center>
<p>She moves a step closer to Amy, threatening now. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>How did you know who I was? 
      <p>AMY<br/>(busted/smiling)<br/>Oops.</p></center>
<p>INT. INITIATIVE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike, flashlight in hand, LEAPS over bodies and equipment, rushes to 
      find: 
      <p>Buffy. Off to the side, struggling under the monster. Spike's 
      flashlight hits the scene, we flash on the monster from the back -- built 
      like a fireplug, compact, muscle-y, but clearly agile. It's got Buffy 
      pinned. 
      <p>Spike runs toward them, gets about halfway there when: 
      <p>He stops. In his tracks. Woozy. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>(quiet)<br/>Oh god, no. Not now.</center>
<p>As the monster and Buffy struggle, we watch as way-too-much BLOOD sort 
      of HICCUPS out of Spike's mouth. His eyes roll back. He grabs his head, 
      KEELS... 
      <p>...and falls. 
      <p>This is it. 
      <p>And the monster, still struggling with Buffy, TURNS. Sees a weakened 
      Spike. We only see a flash of its face (rat-like; dark, threatening, beady 
      eyes) just before it LEAPS off of Buffy and runs toward Spike, easier 
      prey. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike!</center>
<p>But the monster's already got him: Spike is flat on the floor, out 
      cold, as the monster drags his body toward the rubble... 
      <p>INT. SHOP - NIGHT 
      <p>Everything is bright, shiny. Fluorescent lights. Happy. 
      <p>We start out seeing Warren at the display counter, talking to the 
      SHOPKEEPER. In one move, we pull around, see the shopkeeper... 
      <p>
<center>SHOPKEEPER<br/>So, same model as last time?</center>
<p>...keep moving, down to see the display counter and its contents: a 
      nice, wide selection of various HANDGUNS... 
      <p>
<center>SHOPKEEPER (cont'd)<br/>How'd that work out for you?</center>
<p>...and finish by coming back up, we see Willow there now, leaning on 
      the counter, picking up one of the guns. She looks up, smiles at the 
      shopkeeper. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>You'd be amazed.</center>

      <p>ON GILES 
      <p>Still sitting in front of the campfire, not paying attention as, 
      suddenly... He stands, heads toward the sleeping girls-- 
      <p>...he's KNOCKED onto his back by our gang. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Gah! 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Touch him!</p></center>
<p>We see all of them -- Xander, Anya, Dawn and, yes, Andrew -- patting 
      their hands all over Giles' face and torso as Giles looks up at them from 
      the ground. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>I feel him! I feel him! 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Me too. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Me too! 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes. Good. We all feel each other.<br/>(pointed/to 
      Andrew)<br/>Including those of us who don't<br/>really know each other well 
      enough to<br/>take such liberties.</p></p></p></center>
<p>They stop touching Giles. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>I assume there's a perfectly<br/>reasonable and 
      not-at-all insane<br/>explanation coming, yes? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>We thought you might be non-corporeal<br/>evil. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>We got a call. We couldn't remember<br/>you touching anything. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>We had to come make sure you were<br/>okay. We were 
      worried.</p></p></p></center>A beat as Giles takes that in. Touched. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Well, I... I really don't know 
      what<br/>to...<br/>(realization dawns)<br/>Wait, let me understand. You 
      thought<br/>I was evil because I took a group of<br/>young girls on a 
      camping trip and<br/><u>didn't</u> touch them??</center>
<p>A beat. They take in the irony. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>I don't get it.</center>
<p>INT. INITIATIVE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy's tossing rubble and bodies aside, digging for the monster. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike! Spike!</center>
<p>She pushes over a computer monitor on a portable metal stand, and we 
      see the monster, its back to us again, pulling an unconscious Spike into a 
      dark, side corridor. 
      <p>The monster turns, looks at Buffy, LEAPS at her. 
      <p>But this time she's ready, she takes the impact of the leap, turns, 
      forces the monster to the floor. She reaches down, pulls up the monitor 
      and stand and SMASHES the monitor end into the monster's head. 
      <p>The monitor breaks off on impact, stunning the monster. Buffy FLIPS the 
      stand over, aiming the just-broken, jagged, formerly-monitor-end of the 
      metal pole at the monster's throat. 
      <p>She plunges the pole into the monster's neck. It dies. Buffy runs to 
      Spike, kneels next to him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Hey! Hey, you still with me?</center>
<p>Spike MURMURS something, his eyes still closed, his mouth forming a 
      half-smile. 
      <p>Buffy grins, relieved. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>(re: monster)<br/>Well, that guy was --</center>
<p>KA-CHUNG. KA-CHUNG. KA-CHUNG. 
      <p>One by one, the BANKS OF LIGHTS all around the pit area come on, 
      illuminating the carnage and the rubble. We see Buffy and Spike... 
      <p>...surrounded by a circle of UNIFORMED SOLDIERS. With guns. Pointed 
      right at Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>-- just the beginning. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(barely there)<br/>What's happening...?</p></center>
<p>The group's leader, a former INITIATIVE GENERAL, sees Buffy and Spike. 
      <p>
<center>INITIATIVE GENERAL<br/>Ms. Summers. Agent Finn reported<br/>that you 
      tried to contact him earlier<br/>today. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Ha! Government conspiracy, I knew it!</p></center>
<p>The general motions for the other soldiers to lower their weapons. They 
      do. 
      <p>
<center>INITIATIVE GENERAL<br/>He indicated you might be needing 
      our<br/>assistance. We're to provide you<br/>anything you need to help 
      Ass-face<br/>here.</center>
<p>He shifts a bit uncomfortably as Buffy reacts to that. 
      <p>
<center>INITIATIVE GENERAL (cont'd)<br/>Those were his exact words, 
      ma'am.</center>
<p>TIME JUMP TO: 
      <p>INT. INITIATIVE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike on a medical examining table, unconscious. Buffy stands next to 
      the table as the general approaches. 
      <p>
<center>INITIATIVE GENERAL<br/>Med team tells me they took a look at<br/>the 
      chip, ma'am. You were right,<br/>it's degraded. Leave it as it is<br/>much 
      longer, it'll be fatal to him. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay. How long until -- 
      <p>INITIATIVE GENERAL<br/>Now, ma'am. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Right. Of course What do we do<br/>next? 
      <p>INITIATIVE GENERAL<br/>Agent Finn said it was your call,<br/>ma'am. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>My... what was my call? 
      <p>INITIATIVE GENERAL<br/>All decisions regarding Hostile<br/>Seventeen are 
      to be left in your<br/>hands.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy doesn't get it. 
      <p>
<center>INITIATIVE GENERAL (cont'd)<br/>His chip. We can either repair 
      it...<br/>or we can remove it.</center>
<p>And that's a choice Buffy wasn't expecting. As the gravity of it hits 
      her: 
      <p>INT. UC SUNNYDALE CAMPUS - COVEN MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Kennedy and Amy, right where we left them: 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>You. You did this to her.</center>
<p>Amy shrugs, coy. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Guilty.</center>
<p>Kennedy squints, taking this all in. Then, without warning, she SPRINGS 
      forward, THROWING herself at Amy. 
      <p>Just as fast, Amy WAVES her hand, magically sends Kennedy REELING back 
      in the opposite direction, CRASHING into the opposite wall. Kennedy sinks 
      to the floor, looking up at Amy. 
      <p>Kennedy slowly gets to her feet. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>What did you do to her? 
      <p>AMY<br/>What, to Willow? Oh. Just your<br/>standard Penance Malediction 
      is all. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Penance? For what, kissing me?</p></p></center>
<p>Amy stops, stares at Kennedy. Gets it. A smile creeps over her face. 
      <p>
<center>AMY<br/>Wait, seriously? It happened when<br/>she...<br/>(laughing to 
      herself)<br/>Nah, I planted the spell months ago<br/>after that whole "end 
      of the world"<br/>routine... All I had to do was wait<br/>for her to punish 
      herself. -- The<br/>spell just took her thoughts and<br/>powers and made 
      them manifest.<br/>(then)<br/>Turned out much better than I thought<br/>it 
      would. That kiss musta been a<br/>whopper. Nice going, you must be<br/>good. 

      <p>KENNEDY<br/>All right, listen. You've had your<br/>fun. Now undo it. Let 
      her out. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Okay. Oh, wait, I forgot. No. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Why would you do this to her? You<br/>really hate her that 
      much? 
      <p>AMY<br/>(scoffing)<br/>This isn't about hate. It's 
      about<br/>power.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Kennedy reacts to that... 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>Willow always had all the power.<br/>Even before 
      she knew what to do with<br/>it. It came so easy for her. The<br/>rest of 
      us, we had to work twice as<br/>hard to be half as good. But no 
      one<br/>cares how hard you work.</center>
<p>She shakes her head. 
      <p>
<center>AMY (cont'd)<br/>They just care about cute, sweet<br/>Willow. They 
      don't know how weak she<br/>is -- she gave in to evil, stuff<br/>worse than 
      I could ever even<br/>imagine. She almost destroyed the<br/>world! But 
      everyone just keeps...<br/>on... loving her. So what's wrong<br/>with having 
      a little fun? Take her<br/>down a peg or two. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Fun? She's disappearing, fading away<br/>in that... creep, 
      and you think it's<br/>fun? 
      <p>AMY<br/>It was just a game. It's not my<br/>fault she's losing herself. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>I'm gonna stop you now, you know. 
      <p>AMY<br/>Hey, I'm not the bad guy here. I<br/>wonder where he'd be right 
      about now?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Before Kennedy can even react, Amy WAVES her hand, and Kennedy suddenly 
      DISAPPEARS with a bright FLASH... 
      <p>EXT. SUMMERS' HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN 
      <p>...and REAPPEARS in the backyard. Detail-oriented viewers will notice 
      that she stands where Buffy stood when Warren approached the backyard in 
      "Seeing Red." 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>(confused)<br/>Well, that was a hell of a 
thing.</center>
<p>Willow is standing in the very back of the yard... just as Warren did. 
      She approaches, speaking his lines: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>You think you can just do that to me?<br/>That I'd let 
      you get away with it? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Do... get away with what?</p></center>
<p>Kennedy sees the gun, speaks cautiously, calmly: 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>Okay, let's not get excited. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It's too late, this is what I am. I<br/>made it happen, I'll 
      make it stop. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Willow, what did you make happen?</p></p></center>
<p>Willow starts waving the gun, losing it: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>You were there, bitch, you saw it!<br/>I killed 
      her!</center>
<p>Kennedy stops, takes that in. Looks at Willow. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>You mean him. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Him! Her! You know what I mean... 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>But you said her. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No. That was Warren -- 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>No. No, it wasn't, you said I was<br/>there. Who did you 
      kill, Willow? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(avoiding)<br/>It was your fault. Slut. You<br/>tricked me, got 
      me to forget. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>(realizing)<br/>Tara... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(raging)<br/>Shut up! Shut! Up! You do not get<br/>to say her 
      name! Offering it up to<br/>whoever's there. Tricking me into<br/>kissing 
      you...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She stops, gets confused... 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I... I didn't mean that. What I'm<br/>saying... 
      I can't make it --<br/>Kennedy...?</center>
<p>Kennedy looks at Willow, hopeful... 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>...I can't hold on... he's winning.</center>
<p>She lowers the gun, scared... 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I'm being punished... I kissed you,<br/>just for 
      a second, but it was just<br/>enough... I let her go. I didn't<br/>mean it. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Kissing me didn't mean - 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No, she was never gone, she was with<br/>me, we should have 
      been forever...<br/>and I... I let her be dead. She's<br/>really 
      dead.</p></p></center>
<p>She's withdrawing into herself... 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>And I killed her.</center>
<p>Kennedy takes a step to Willow, terrified 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Willow, no. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(looking up)<br/>Oh, baby, I'm so sorry... don't leave<br/>me 
      again, baby, come back, I'm sorry,<br/>come back. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Willow.</p></p></center>
<p>Kennedy watches her, sees her slipping further away. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>I don't think you did anything wrong.<br/>This 
      is just magic. And I think I'm<br/>figuring the whole magic thing 
      out.</center>
<p>She moves forward, toward Willow. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>It's just like fairy tales.</center>
<p>She's almost there. Startled, Willow looks up. Afraid. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>What are you doing?</center>
<p>Kennedy gets right to Willow, looks at Willow compassionately, kindly. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>Bringing you back to life.</center>
<p>She reaches out, takes Willow in her arms... and she KISSES Willow. 
      Again. 
      <p>Willow struggles for a moment, but then, slowly, quietly, she melts 
      into it, lets go. 
      <p>The gun falls to the grass. 
      <p>As the kiss lingers, we pull around, realize it's Willow, kissing 
      Kennedy, crying -- Warren's gone. 
      <p>They break the kiss, Kennedy looks at Willow. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY (cont'd)<br/>H'mmm. I <u>am</u> good.</center>
<p>Willow slowly, tentatively brings her hands to her face, feels it. 
      Recognizes her own features. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>It's me? I'm back?</center>
<p>Kennedy nods. Willow breathes a sigh of relief. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Oh, god. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>You all right?</p></center>
<p>Willow looks around, sees where she is, takes it in. Looks up at the 
      bedroom window... no one's up there, of course. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I have no idea.</center>
<p>She rests her head on Kennedy's shoulder, and they start back into the 
      house. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I'm so tired... 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Yeah I'll make you some tea.</p></center>
