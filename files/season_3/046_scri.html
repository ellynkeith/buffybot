<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The CAMERA FLOATS PAST FLICKERING CANDLES 
      casting shadows that dance across the walls, PAST a blanket laid out with 
      various foodstuffs: bottled mineral water, French bread, grapes, etc. 
      Gothically romantic. Apropos of the mood, we soon hear HEAVY BREATHING 
      and...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY's head falls into frame, her brow 
      sweaty, muscles taut, straining, her hands gripping the shoulders of 
      ANGEL, appearing in frame, above her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A moment, and she brings her knees up hard, 
      flipping him over her and onto his back. THUD! Buffy springs to her feet. 
      Angel quickly recovers and he rushes her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They tussle. She sweep kicks his legs out 
      from under and he hits the floor hard, knocking the wind out of him. 
      </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Swiftly, Buffy snatches the French bread, 
      ROLLS over to Angel's prone body, then kneels on his chest, pinning him, 
      the bread poised over his heart like a stake.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Gotchya.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>Right in the 
      heart.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She tosses the bread back. They are still 
      entwined, still close.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Satisfied?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>I'm not sure that's the 
      word...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A little close to home - self-awareness 
      intrudes and discomfort sets in. She quickly stands.</font></p>
<p>

      <br/>like-</font></center>
<p></p>

      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>'Cause we're not having

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She stops, realizing the moment has passed 
      and she can relax.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Thanks. For the work 
      out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>Am I going to see you this 
      weekend? <br/>You probably have plans...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Birthday, right. Actually, 
      yeah, I do <br/>have a thing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>A thing? A 
      date?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(smiling)<br/>Nice attempt at 
      casual. It is a date. <br/>Older man. Very handsome. Likes it <br/>when I 
      call him "Daddy."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>(smiles)<br/>Your 
      father.<br/>(sudden worry)<br/>It is your father...</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>He's taking me to the ice 
      show. It's <br/>great fun. And I could definitely use <br/>a little more 
      fun.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON: Buffy's glum face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She is staring at a crystal dangling right 
      in front of her from a leather string.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES (O.S.)<br/>And this 
      one?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WIDEN to find GILES holding the string and 
      Buffy sitting at the table, a variety of stone and crystals laid out 
      before her. She scrutinizes the crystal with a lack of

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES <br/>(growing impatient)<br/>For 
      charm bags, money spells,<br/>and cleansing one's aura.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay, so: how do you know 
      when<br/>your aura's dirty? Somebody come <br/>by with a finger and write 
      "wash me" <br/>on it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Buffy, I'm aware of your 
      distaste for<br/>studying the vibratory stones, but as<br/>it's part of your 
      training, I'd appreciate<br/>your glib-free attention.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Sorry. I just figure with 
      Faith on one <br/>of her unannounced walkabouts<br/>someone should be out 
      patrolling.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Faith is not interested in 
      proper <br/>training, so I rely on you to keep<br/>up with 
      yours.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I hate being the "good" 
      one.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>And as for patrolling, you'll 
      be out<br/>there soon enough, why so anxious?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy appears self-conscious.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Let's just say I've got a lot 
      of energy <br/>to burn off.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Due time. For the present, if 
      it's not<br/>entirely beyond your capabilities...<br/>try to 
      concentrate.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles places a large BLUE CRYSTAL before 
      her. Buffy sighs heavily, then lazily eyes the crystal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faint WIND-CHIMES are heard...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATER (NIGHT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The CHIMES blend into the RUSTY SQUEAKS of 
      child swings, a small whirligig, moving slowly in the night 
      breeze.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then, a SCREAM as a VAMPIRE'S airborne body 
      comes crashing down near the top of a slide. Gravity takes him for a ride 
      to the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">in prime fighting mode, easily dominating 
      her adversary.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Wow, that was really funny 
      looking.<br/>Could you do that again?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VAMPIRE<br/>I'll kill you for 
      that!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>For that? What were you trying 
      to <br/>kill me for before?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She deftly roundhouse kicks the vamp in the 
      face, sending him sprawling onto the whirligig.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She whips out a stake and holds it 
      high.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY <br/>Okay, so here's the deal 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WHOOF - she suddenly appears DIZZY and 
      staggers a bit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE VAMP eyes her suspiciously. Then, seeing 
      an opportunity, he LUNGES, throwing her to the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Instantly, he's on top of her, much like 
      Angel earlier, only this time Buffy's far from in control.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The vamp GRIPS the stake in Buffy's hand 
      and, with little effort, twists it until the sharp point touches her 
      chest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He pushes down on the stake hovering over 
      her heart and WHISPERS to her in a manner both intimate and 
      obscene:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VAMPIRE<br/>Let me know if I'm not doing 
      this <br/>right.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">terrified and struggling, but weak and 
      disoriented, as the stake presses down on her chest.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY'S EYES</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The pain brings her focus back and she gives 
      the vamp a ferocious HEAD BUTT. He rolls off her, nursing a bleeding 
      brow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Buffy wearily pushes herself up, she 
      spots</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE STAKE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">lying on the ground where it was dropped. 
      She scrambles toward it on all fours as the vampire recovers and sees 
      her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Snarling, he DIVES at her. Too late. Buffy 
      turns over, and he impales himself on the stake propped up in her hands. 
      Dust.</font></p>

      shake off her near death experience.</font></p>

      walks away.</font></p>

      FIGURE, unseen by Buffy, lurking in the shadows.</font></p>

      of light generated by different fixtures. A real spook house.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">For a few moments, we observe a weary YOUNG 
      MAN perched at the top of a teetering stepladder, laying mortar and the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANOTHER YOUNG MAN, looking as overworked as

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Travers follows a LOW, GUTTURAL SOUND that's 
      been droning on for some time to a heretofore unseen large, heavy wooden 
      CRATE propped up against the wall, next to a mantelpiece. The wood is old 
      and scarred. The lid padlocked in four places. HUM emanates from 
      it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He studies her for a bit. She's FROZEN. And 
      Giles doesn't seem a bit surprised. He reaches under the table, picks up 
      his case and from it produces a small leather box. He opens it to reveal 
      one FREAKIN' HUGE HYPODERMIC NEEDLE filled with a faintly yellow liquid. 
      Turning back to Buffy, he swabs her arm and (off-camera) injects her. She 
      doesn't flinch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">One more swab then he quickly shoves the 
      hypo back into the box, the box back into his case, the case back under 
      the table. Satisfied that all is as it was, he reaches out...</font></p>

      Quentin. I know you can <br/>put a stop to it.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>I'm sorry. A slayer must be 
      more<br/>than physical prowess. She must<br/>have cunning, imagination... a

      dressed in a pale green jumpsuit and trundled up in a STRAIT JACKET. Blair 
      and Hobson are momentarily stopped by Kralik's gaze, until they are

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks at her, thrown.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I mean, there's a slight, 
      eensy <br/>possibility and it just seems like,<br/>maybe, it's a good thing 
      to get on<br/>out there and discuss. Just in 
case.<br/>Right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy tries to cover her fears on the

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay. If I don't' get my

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>On the short side for a

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I mean, there's a plus side to

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>As for

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Then there's the buying 
      outfits without <br/>worrying if they're good for 
      bleeding-<br/>and-killing-and-dying in. There's a lot<br/>of good to 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Actually, it could really 
      open up-</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow doesn't have a chance to finish

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Did you find out...

      bothered by something, closes the book.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Angel. Thank you. It's 
      beautiful.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angel looks unsure, reading her 
      mood.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>You really like 
      it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy tries for more enthusiasm. Leafs 
      through the book.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Of course I do. It's 
      thoughtful and<br/>sweet and, uh, full of neat words to<br/>learn and say 
      like "wilt" and<br/>"henceforth..."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>(kindly)<br/>Then why did you 
      seem more excited<br/>last year when you got a severed arm<br/>in a 
      box?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy sees that she's nailed. Lets 
      down.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm sorry. Really - I love the 
      book.<br/>And I love what you wrote.<br/>(then)<br/>It's just... Suddenly, 
      there's this <br/>chance that my calling could be a<br/>wrong number. I 
      guess it's freaking<br/>me out a little.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>That's 
      understandable.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What if I have lost my powers, 
      Angel?<br/>I mean, for good?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>You lived a long time without 
      them.<br/>You can do it again.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy stands - agitated.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I guess.<br/>(then)<br/>But what 
      if I can't? I've seen too <br/>much now. I <u>know</u> what goes bump 
      <br/>in the night. Not being able to fight <br/>it - what if I just hide 
      under my bed,<br/>all scared and helpless...<br/>(worse thought)<br/>Or what 
      if I just get pathetic?<br/>Hanging out at "The Old Slayer's <br/>Home" - 
      talking people's ears off<br/>about my glory days... showing them<br/>Mr. 
      Pointy, the stake I had bronzed...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angel moves to her, speaks 
      soothingly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>Buffy. You couldn't be 
      helpless or boring. <br/>Not even if you tried.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh, don't be so sure. Before I 
      became<br/>the Slayer I was... well I don't want<br/>to say shallow, but... 
      let's just say a <br/>certain person who shall remain nameless,<br/>let's 
      call her "Spordelia", looked like a <br/>classical philosopher next to me. 
      If I'm <br/>not the Slayer, I mean... what do I have <br/>to 
      offer?<br/>(quietly)<br/>Why would you like me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL <br/>I saw you before you became 
      the<br/>Slayer.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>I watched you, I saw you 
      called. It<br/>was a bright afternoon, out in front<br/>of your school, you 
      walked down the<br/>steps and I loved you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Why?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>Because I could see your 
      heart. You<br/>held it before you for everyone to <br/>see and I worried 
      that it would be <br/>bruised or torn. More than anything<br/>in my life I 
      wanted to keep it safe,<br/>to warm it with my own.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She folds into his arms, 
whispers.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's 
      beautiful.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A moment, as he holds her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Or, taken literally, 
      incredibly gross.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>I was just thinking that 
      too.</font></center>

      vampire form and his eyes snap open. He gets to his feet.</font></p>

      drained<br/>you too much. I do that sometimes.</font></center>

      toward Kralik.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Something causes him to hesitate. He lifts

      TACKY with BLOOD. He quickly glances up to the top landing, then at the 
      crate. Squinting in the dim light, he notices for the first time the 
      unlocked padlocks and open latches.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">His eyes widen as terror seeps into them. 
      Instinctively, he backs away from the crate, the KICKS one of the

      up a makeshift stake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He cautiously moves to the box, takes hold 
      of the lid. Summoning his courage, he RIPS IT OPEN.</font></p>

      much for a<br/>lapdance for me and my buddy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She freezes. Slowly she turns and starts 
      toward them. Then stops. What's she gonna do about it? Frustrated, she 
      keeps walking, turning down a back alley.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(self-mocking)<br/>"Walk me 
      home? Don't be silly,<br/>Angel. I can take care of 
myself."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then, she hears something: HUMMING. LOW, 
      GUTTURAL, TUNELESS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks around. Nothing. Unnerved, she 
      looks behind her.</font></p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KRALIK<br/>Wish I could. But my mind's 
      not <br/>what it used to be.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She tries to pull away, but he grabs her 
      sleeve. Instinctively she hits him in the face. Twice. He doesn't feel it 
      at all. Her terror builds as she WHIMPERS:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Let me go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KRALIK<br/>Didn't say 
      please.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He pulls her closer, fangs bared. Then her 
      sleeve slips off her arm. She uses the opportunity to scramble out of her 
      coat, then retreats a few steps, only to find</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BLAIR</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">blocking the way. She takes off in the 
      opposite direction, running for her life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Kralik gestures with his head and Blair 
      gives chase.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks around, desperately, then spots 
      a high chain-link fence and makes for it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Help me 
please!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She LUNGES for the fence, but, with her 
      leaping ability on the fritz, she can't... quite... reach the... 
      top.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Frantic, she suddenly notices a small hole 
      in the chain link a few yards in front of her. She looks back to find 
      Blair is almost upon her. Sprinting as fast as she can to the opening, she 
      clumsily pushes herself through. The jagged cut links in the fence scratch 
      her face, her arms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Blair grabs her leg. She SCREAMS, then 
      manages to pull away, staggering backwards. Blair's hand is reaching for 
      her. Before she can get her baring, she's bathed in an INCREASINGLY BRIGHT 
      LIGHT. She turns and squints into its source.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HEADLIGHTS from an oncoming car. Buffy tries 
      to wave it down.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Stop! Please! I 
      need-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The car never slows, almost mowing her 
      down.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(pleading)<br/>Stop!!!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks back to the fence to see Blair 
      scaling it. She SCREAMS and turns to run, failing to notice the LIGHTS 
      from another oncoming car, heading straight for her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Too late to jump out of the way, Buffy 
      braces to be hit. At the last instant, the care swerves to her right and 
      screeches to a halt. The passenger door swings open and Buffy 
      sees...</font></p>
<p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cross still held out, Buffy inches toward 
      her bag. Kralik suddenly grabs her hand, cross in it. He pulls open his 
      jumpsuit and shoves her hand in, holding the cross against his chest. He 
      smiles as smoke begins to stream out of the jumpsuit. Moves her hand down 
      just a bit to his stomach -</font></p>

      mother is. She moves slowly toward the foot of the staircase, expecting 
      Kralik to seep in from the anteroom and head her off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He doesn't. There is only 
silence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy reaches the stairs and moves quickly 
      up them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Kralik's hand bursts through the rails and 
      grabs her ankle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She's halfway up and he's on the hall floor, 
      having followed her through the kitchen. One yank and her legs come out 
      from under her, she falls, her head hitting a step HARD, a WHITE FLASH of 
      pain as she momentarily blacks out -</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">-- as she comes to in a second, he's still 
      grabbing at her - she fumbles for a splintered rail, jabs it at his face. 
      He snarls and withdraws enough for her to get up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Blood is coming down her face where she hit 
      her head - a small stream, but more than the Slayer is used to shedding. 
      Hand to her head she limps up the stairs as Kralik comes around to the 
      foot. She enters the</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BOARDING HOUSE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - 
      CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">and quickly dashes into the</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BOARDING HOUSE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
      (NIGHT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">and slams the door shut behind her, bolting 
      it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's pitch black in here. Buffy stumbles, 
      looking for a light.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A huge SLAM and the door shakes, Kralik 
      outside trying to break through. Again. Buffy still stumbles about - till 
      her hand finds a dangling light cord. She pulls it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The room is lit by a bare bulb. Every square 
      inch of wall space is covered with polaroids of Joyce. Every inch. Buffy 
      wigs at first - then looks more closely:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: A PHOTO OF JOYCE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Behind Joyce is clearly the boiler. She's in 
      the basement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Kralik's fist BURSTS through the door, 
      starts reaching for the bolt. Buffy looks - there's another door and she 
      goes out it, coming out again into the</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BOARDING HOUSE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - 
      CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">To one side is the laundry chute. The other 
      leads back downstairs - she heads that way but Kralik steps in the way, 
      grabs her. Not smiling.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KRALIK<br/>If you stray from the path 
      you <br/>will lose your way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He bears down on her neck - she fights 
      wildly but she's just a girl, pinned and wriggling as he gets his mouth 
      closer to her, he whispers urgently -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KRALIK<br/>I won't take it all, I won't 
      take it all...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy is helpless, still making one last 
      effort to push him away - and he rears back, roaring. Clutching his 
      head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy tries to take the moment to get by 
      him, but he SLAMS her against the wall. She's dazed as he fumbles in his 
      pocket, pulls out his bottle of pills. With shaking hands, he tries to 
      open it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy darts forward and grabs the bottle, 
      racing AWAY from Kralik, down the hall and she dives into the laundry 
      chute, two feet in front of him reaching for her:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE - CONTINUOUS 
      (NIGHT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy shoots down it, head first, as Kralik 
      - obviously too big to fit - grabs futilely for her. He is 
      screaming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BOARDING HOUSE CELLAR - CONTINUOUS 
      (NIGHT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy comes out of the chute and hits the 
      ground hard. She almost can't get up. Then she hears:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Buffy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks up to see Joyce tied to the chair. 
      She pulls herself up, clothes torn, head bloodied, shaking. But not 
      down.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Buffy, we have to 
      get-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy holds her fingers to her lips. Looks 
      around for a weapon, an idea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: THE DOOR</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Is just BLOWN off its hinges by the force of 
      Kralik's blow. He comes down the stairs, screaming:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KRALIK<br/>Where are they?! <b>Where are 
      they?!?</b></font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's dazed with pain, but twice as lethal. 
      He moves into the cellar - sees Joyce still tied up -</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy tries to slip by him upstairs but he 
      grabs her, throws her against the wall. He pulls the pills from her 
      fingers and rips off the top, pouring them into his mouth. Grabs the water 
      glass we saw earlier and washes them down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The pain subsides almost instantly. He turns 
      to Buffy, who has sunk down into the corner.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KRALIK<br/>You almost got away little 
      girl.<br/>I almost lay down and -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He stops, sudden pain wrenching his gut. He 
      is still holding the glass and the bottle of pills - he looks at 
      Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KRALIK<br/>What did you... My 
      pills...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Very calmly, Buffy shakes her head. She 
      holds up a small, and now empty, container. Of holy water.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Kralik's eyes go wide.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As does his mouth, which smokes, sizzles, 
      and is eaten away from the inside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Kralik's whole body begins to tremble and 
      crack, Buffy stands.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>If I had the Slayer's power... 
      I'd <br/>be punning right about now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He explodes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy stares her deadpan warrior stare at 
      the space he used to occupy. A moment, and she moves to Joyce, starts 
      untying her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Buffy, thank God you're okay. 
      <br/>That man...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I can't get these. They're too 
      tight.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE <br/>Well, can't you 
      just-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Not right now. Maybe there's 
      some<br/>clippers-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She moves away - and Blair is right behind 
      her, looking pissed.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Buffy!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Buffy spins, Blair moves - and is tackled 
      from the side by Giles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The two of them go crashing into a tool 
      shelf - Blair turns on Giles, punching him with jaw-snapping 
      force.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks around for a weapon - and a 
      stake pops out of Blair's back, pushed through the front by Giles. Blair 
      dusts, leaving Giles and Buffy staring at one another.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS (V.O.)<br/>Congratulations. You 
      pass.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy sits at the table, holding a wet cloth 
      to her head. Travers stands before her, Giles stands nearby. Nobody looks 
      wildly happy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>You exhibited extraordinary 
      courage<br/>and clearheadedness in battle. The <br/>council is very 
      pleased.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Do I get a gold 
      star?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>I understand that you're 
      upset -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You understand nothing. You 
      set that <br/>monster loose and he came after my 
      <br/><b>mother</b>.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>You think the test was 
      unfair?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I think you better get out of 
      town <br/>before I get my strength back.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>We're not in the business of 
      'fair',<br/>Miss Summers. We're fighting a war.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>You're <b>waging</b> a war. 
      She's fighting<br/>it. There is a difference.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>Mr. Giles, if you don't 
      mind-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>The test is done. We're 
      finished.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>Not quite. She passed. You 
      didn't.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Neither Giles nor Buffy knows what to 
      say.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>The Slayer isn't the only 
      one who must<br/>perform in this situation. I have <br/>recommended to the 
      council, and they <br/>have agreed, that you be relieved of <br/>your duties 
      as watcher effective <br/>immediately. You're fired.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>On what 
      grounds?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>Your affection for your 
      charge has <br/>rendered you incapable of clear and <br/>impartial judgment. 
      You have a father's<br/>love for the child and that is useless<br/>to the 
      cause.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A moment, as Buffy registers the truth in 
      this. Giles does not even look at her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>It would be best for you not 
      to have<br/>further contact with the Slayer-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I'm not going 
      anywhere.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>No, well, I didn't expect 
      you to adhere<br/>to that. However, if you interfere with <br/>the new 
      watcher or try to countermand<br/>his authority in any way you will be 
      dealt <br/>with. Are we clear.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>We're very 
      clear.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>(to 
      Buffy)<br/>Congratulations again.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Bite me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TRAVERS<br/>(turning to go)<br/>Yes. 
      Well. Colorful girl.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He throws a look at Giles and walks out. 
      Neither Giles nor Buffy says anything for a while. She puts the rag to her 
      head and winces-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Ow!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">--with pain. Giles moves to her, 
      instinctively.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Let me see...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks up at him. A moment of silence, 
      and she slowly hands him the rag. He dips it in water and squats down, 
      inspecting the wound, dabbing it with the rag.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She says nothing. Lets him tend to 
      her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, Willow, Oz, Xander and Joyce mill 
      about. They have all been making lunch together, talking, making with the 
      lemonade.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I just can't believe Giles 
      was fired!<br/>How could Giles get fired?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>So how did you manage to kill 
      Kralik?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Oh, she was very 
      clever.<br/>(off Buffy's look)<br/>You go ahead and tell it, dear. You tell 
      <br/>it better.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But when you say fired, you 
      mean fired?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You're not cruising past that 
      concept<br/>anytime soon, are you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WLLOW<br/>It's just-he's been fired! 
      He's <br/>unemployed! He's between jobs!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Giles isn't going anywhere, 
      Will.<br/>He's still librarian.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay, but I'm writing an 
      angry letter.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Nothing's really gonna change. 
      The<br/>important thing is, I kept up my <br/>special birthday tradition of 
      gut-<br/>wrenching misery and horror.</font></center>

      the same,<br/>but once I... get back to... full...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She can't do it. Xander smiles at her 
      condescendingly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Give you a hand with that, 
      little lady?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Playful daggers in her eyes, she hands him 
      the jar.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You're loving this far too

      need <br/>a big strong...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">-- and., smiling, completely fails to open
