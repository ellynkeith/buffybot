      <p>FADE UP: 
      <p>EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKY/SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
      <p>ON STORM CLOUDS in a NIGHT SKY as RAIN pours down, and LIGHTNING 
      FLASHES. TILT DOWN to reveal the unmistakable cityscape of Manhattan, 
      broken by the tops of trees. 
      <p><u>TITLE</u>: NEW YORK CITY, 1977. 
      <p>A FLASH of lightning WHITES us into 
      <p>EXT. CENTRAL PARK - 1977 - FLASHBACK 
      <p>A BIRD'S EYE VIEW, amid the downpour, of a battle being waged between 
      two combatants whom we'll soon learn are NIKKI, the Vampire Slayer (in her 
      BLACK DUSTER), and 70's punk (not the same outfit as train in "Fool For 
      Love) SPIKE (in VAMPFACE). We see large stones, sidewalk railings, trash 
      cans and some benches, behind one of which we may notice a shape. NIKKI 
      runs and double kicks Spike in the chest, knocking him down as we 
      <p>CUT IN to see SPIKE splash down onto the pavement and roll up onto his 
      feet. Grinning, impressed. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Well, all right! Got the moves,<br/>don't you? Gonna ride 
      you hard<br/>before I put you away, luv. 
      <p>NIKKI<br/>Sure about that? You seem a little<br/>wet and limp to me. And 
      I'm not your<br/>"luv."</p></center>
<p>She charges him, launching another attack. As they fight... 
      <p>CUT TO SOMEONE'S POV of the battle - peering between the slats of a 
      park bench. 
      <p>NEW ANGLE TO REVEAL four year-old ROBIN (one day to be "Principal") 
      WOOD, crouched behind the bench, next to a trash can, peering out at the 
      two large-than-life warriors. His eyes wide with fear. 
      <p>ON NIKKI and SPIKE in their pas de deux. After a few moves, Nikki tries 
      to throw another punch. 
      <p>Spike dodges it and twists her arm behind her back. He wraps his other 
      arm around her throat and pulls her close to him. 
      <p>CLOSE ON ROBIN, panicking, he restlessly shifts, knocking into the 
      trash receptacle next to him. 
      <p>SPIKE, distracted, glances over at the noise. NIKKI uses the 
      opportunity to butt him with the back of her head and break free. As Spike 
      staggers back... 
      <p>NIKKI somersaults to her feet, reaches into her coat, pulls out a stake 
      and throws it at him. 
      <p>SPIKE catches the stake in mid-air. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Tsk, tsk, tsk. Taken me a long time<br/>to track you down. 
      Don't really want<br/>to end the dance so soon, do you,<br/>Nikki? Music's 
      just startin', in'it?</center>
<p>As he turns to go, he tosses the stake aside. 
      <p>ON THE STAKE as it clatters to the ground. Tilt up to see it's settled 
      near Robin. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>(turning back again)<br/>Oh, and... <u>Love</u> 
      the coat.</center>
<p>He moves off into the darkness. 
      <p>ON NIKKI, watching him go for a moment before she hears: 
      <p>
<center>ROBIN (O.S.)<br/>Mama?</center>
<p>He turns her attention toward ROBIN, who emerges from behind the bench, 
      looking small and scared. Nikki goes and crouches next to him as she 
      straightens the hood on his rain slicker. 
      <p>
<center>NIKKI<br/>Did real good, baby boy. Stayed down<br/>just like Mama 
      told you. 
      <p>ROBIN<br/>Can we go home now? 
      <p>NIKKI<br/>(shakes her head)<br/>Nuh-uh... Not safe there 
      anymore.<br/>(then)<br/>Hey, how 'bout I leave you with<br/>Crowley? He's got 
      those spooky<br/>doodads you like playin' -- 
      <p>ROBIN<br/>No. I wanna stay with you.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Nikki takes that in. Looks back where Spike headed off, then, after a 
      beat. 
      <p>
<center>NIKKI<br/>Yeah, I know you do, baby. But...<br/>Remember, Robin 
      honey... what we<br/>talked about... Always gotta work<br/>the 
      mission.</center>
<p>Robin looks away. 
      <p>
<center>NIKKI (cont'd)<br/>Look at me. You know I love you.<br/>But I got a 
      job to do. The mission's<br/>what matters. Right?</center>
<p>Robin nods. 
      <p>
<center>NIKKI (cont'd)<br/>That's my baby. C'mon.</center>
<p>She stands, takes his hand, and they walk off a bit before ROBIN pulls 
      free of her grasp, turns and runs back to retrieve THE STAKE, lying on the 
      ground. As he picks it up... 
      <p>
<center>NIKKI (cont'd)<br/>(calling out to him)<br/>Robin!</center>
<p>A FLASH of lightning and we're in... 
      <p>EXT. ALLEY - PRESENT - NIGHT 
      <p>Grown-up ROBIN WOOD, whips around, holding a jagged piece of a crushed 
      wooden crate (an impromptu stake) as 
      <p>A LARGE VAMP throws a punch at him. Wood ducks it, then spins with a 
      roundhouse kick that connects and whips the vamp's head back - but it 
      snaps back and tackles Wood, the two of them falling into a 
      <p>WIDE SHOT in which we see BUFFY, in the background, squaring off with 
      her own LARGE VAMP (#2) and SPIKE (wearing the DUSTER) in a brawl with 
      another VAMP (#3) who wields a broken, rust, old shovel. Wood continues 
      his assault on VAMP #1. He glances over at 
      <p>BUFFY, working over her vamp pretty well, though he is strong and 
      matches her moves. 
      <p>ON SPIKE, having a bit easier time of it. He pounds his vamp (#3) back, 
      and with a kick sends him flying into a dumpster, slipping to the ground. 
      <p>ON VAMP #3, dazed but recovering, looks up as Spike appears over him 
      with the shovel and JABS it into the vamp's throat (out of frame), 
      essentially decapitating him as we HEAR an off-screen dusting. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>Spike!</center>
<p>He looks at her as she gestures with a glance toward Wood. 
      <p>Spike looks over to see 
      <p>WOOD, now on the receiving end of some blows delivered by Vamp #1, 
      though he manages to get in a few licks himself. 
      <p>ON WOOD, as Vamp #1 sweeps the legs out from under him. He goes down. 
      <p>VAMP #1 looms over WOOD and is about to strike when... POOF! He's 
      DUSTED. Reveal SPIKE standing behind him with the splintered end of the 
      shovel's handle. 
      <p>He steps in to Wood, grabs his arm and pulls him to his feet. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Little tip, mate. The stake's your<br/>friend, don't be 
      afraid to use it.</center>
<p>Wood just stares at him as Spike turns to go, then stops, sensing 
      something's on Wood's mind. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>What?</center>
<p>Wood shakes his head slightly, Spike eyes him for a moment, then moves 
      off toward Buffy. 
      <p>ON WOOD, watching him go with a stony glare. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>(quietly)<br/>Just waiting for my moment...</center>
<p>TILT DOWN to his hand to see him squeezing the stake so tightly, blood 
      has begun to trickle out of his clenched fist.

      NEXT DAY 
      <p>Stock of backpack-laden kids arriving for a new day of school. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - PRINCIPAL WOOD'S OFFICE - DAY 
      <p>ON WOOD, peering out of the blinds, watching them arrive. His hand's 
      bandaged. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>Situation still normal.</center>
<p>Wood turns to see Buffy entering. Behind her we see an active outer 
      office and student traffic milling about the hallways as PAINTERS roll 
      paint over the graffitied walls and a CUSTODIAN scrapes dried brain matter 
      off the window. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Or as normal as this school ever sees. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>So it appears. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, no fires, nobody's head's gone<br/>ka-blooey. And the 
      marching band and<br/>swing choir have gone back to their<br/>normal, 
      healthy seething resentment. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Been pretty quiet around her since<br/>you shut down that Seal. 
      You may<br/>have stopped this thing. </p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy considers that, then shakes her head skeptically. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I saw an army of Ubervamps. In my<br/>vision. An army was 
      going to<br/>rise up from the Hellmouth. From<br/>that Seal. To think I 
      stopped The<br/>First... It can't be that easy. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Call that easy? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hey, any apocalypse I avert without<br/>dying. Those are the 
      easy ones.</p></p></center>
<p>Wood moves to her, looking at her warmly. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>Y'know, you're something else, Miss<br/>Summers. I've been 
      watching you.<br/>When we're out patrolling. You're...<br/>(then)<br/>You 
      remind me of... </center>
<p>He stops himself. Buffy looks at him, understanding. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Your mother? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Well... Yeah. Actually. What I<br/>remember of her. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(smiling, wryly)<br/>Gotta tell ya, not a line every 
      girl<br/>likes to hear. But, in this case -<br/>compliment taken. </p></p></center>
<p>They share a smile, standing close for a moment, then... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Ah, maybe you're right. Maybe<br/>everything's 
      fine. 
      <p>GILES (O.S.)<br/>Everything's terrible. </p></center>
<p>Wood and Buffy turn to see 
      <p>GILES, standing in the doorway. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>A total catastrophe. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Giles -- what's wrong? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Have you seen the new library? It's<br/>nothing but computers. 
      Not a book to<br/>be seen. I don't know where to<br/>begin... Buffy, who do 
      we talk to? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I guess that'd be me...<br/>(extends hand)<br/>Hi. Robin Wood. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes, of course. Rupert Giles.<br/>Buffy's told me you're 
      something of<br/>a freelance demon fighter. I'm<br/>relieved. We're running 
      dangerously<br/>low on allies. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So. I didn't stop it then. 
      <p>GILES<br/>The seers in the coven are certain<br/>The First is continuing 
      to gather its<br/>forces. The few Potential Slayers<br/>left across the 
      globe are still being<br/>murdered before we can get to 
      them.<br/>(gravely)<br/>I'm afraid war is inevitable. </p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>As that declaration hangs there, Giles looks at Wood. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>We should go before the school board. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>What? 
      <p>GILES<br/>I can have my backup library sent<br/>from home, in the 
      meantime. It isn't<br/>much, but-- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/><u>Giles</u> -- 
      <p>GILES<br/>Knowledge comes from crafted bindings<br/>and pages, Buffy, not 
      ones and zeroes. </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy and Wood share a look. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(to Giles)<br/>Did you bring back more Potentials? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Ah, no. Actually my trip was on a<br/>different matter. 
      Regarding Spike. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spike? What about him? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy, I told you my concerns when<br/>you recklessly chose to 
      remove the<br/>chip in his head. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Wait. Sorry. Chip? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Long story-- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Military put a chip in Spike's brain<br/>so he couldn't hurt 
      anyone. 
      <p>GILES<br/>And that would be the abridged<br/>version. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He has a soul now, Giles. Spike<br/>won't let himself harm 
      anyone. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Unless The First triggers him again. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Triggers the chip? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(shaking her head)<br/>The trigger's a post-hypnotic 
      deal<br/>The First put in his head. Made<br/>him...<br/>(tough to say)<br/>He 
      was killing again. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>So he's got a trigger, a soul and a<br/>chip. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Not anymore. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It was killing him, Giles. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>The trigger? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The chip. The trigger's not working<br/>anymore. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Because the military gave him a soul. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy just looks at him. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Sorry. 
      <p>GILES<br/>We don't know that the trigger's<br/>inactive. But I've brought 
      something<br/>back with me that may help us to<br/>disarm it. And ascertain 
      what it is,<br/>exactly, that causes Spike's behavior. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's that song. I'm sure it has to<br/>do with that song he was 
      singing. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes, but he has no memory of it. Is<br/>there any part of it 
      you can remember? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(defensively)<br/>I dunno. I mean... Not like it had<br/>a 
      catchy hook or anything, like, "I'm<br/>Comin' Up So You Better Get 
      This<br/>Party Started." It was boring, old,<br/>and English. Just like 
      yo--<br/>(off his glower)<br/>--ul. Brynner. Yul Brynner.<br/>(beat)<br/>A... 
      British Yul Brynner. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>(to Giles)<br/>This thing you brought. To keep<br/>Spike from 
      killing again. How does<br/>it work? 
      <p>GILES<br/>It will require a bit of magic.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>

      <p>ON ANDREW, entering from the foyer and finding KENNEDY, RONA, MOLLY and 
      a couple of other Potentials, milling about in quiet, frustrated, 
      discussion. 
      <p>
<center>KENNEDY<br/>...It's not right. We're all a part<br/>of this. 
      Whatever's happening, we<br/>should know-- 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Hey. What's going on, girlfriend? </p></center>
<p>They stop talking and look at him. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>Wait. Are you guys planning a<br/>surprise party 
      for me? 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>Buffy and the others are up to<br/>something in the cellar. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>What others? 
      <p>RONA<br/>Y'know. <i>Senior</i> officers. Only<br/>they're not telling us 
      grunts squat. 
      <p>MOLLY<br/>Unless you count "stay away." 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(self-conscious)<br/>Did they mention me... 
      specifically?<br/>As in, "tell Andrew not to come down<br/>here. Because we 
      hate him." 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>No. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(false bravado)<br/>Well, then... I think I'll just go<br/>down 
      there and... demand to know<br/>what's going on. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He makes a move toward the basement as ANYA enters from there. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>You don't want to go down there. </center>
<p>Andrew looks back at the Potentials, then for their benefit, makes a 
      stand. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>As a matter of fact, Anya, I do.<br/>We're all a part of 
      this. Whatever's<br/>happening, we have a right to know.<br/>(to 
      others)<br/>Don't we, girls? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>They're doing something that's gonna<br/>set off that psycho 
      trigger The First<br/>put in Spike's melon. </p></center>
<p>Andrew's forceful facade melts. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>I see. You mean, the one that makes<br/>him Hulk-out, 
      smash through walls<br/>and... rip into my throat? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Yuh-huh. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>(small)<br/>'Kay. Thanks. </p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - BASEMENT - MEANWHILE 
      <p>ON SPIKE being shackled to the wall by XANDER. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(muttering to himself)<br/>Couldn't have put the chains 
      back up<br/>a week ago... no, we have to wait<br/>'til "pretending time's" 
      over to work<br/>on Spike... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>What? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Nothing. </p></p></center>
<p>ON BUFFY, standing across from Spike. Along with GILES, WILLOW scanning 
      a book), DAWN and WOOD. 
      <p>Spike looks over at Wood. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>(testy)<br/>What you doin' here? Came to see the<br/>show? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Thought you might need the support. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Uh huh.<br/>(to Giles)<br/>Right. Let's get this over 
      with.<br/>What're you gonna do? Some hypno-<br/>beam or disarming spell? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Not exactly. The First has<br/>brainwashed you. There's 
      something<br/>in your subconscious The First is<br/>using to provoke a 
      violent reaction.<br/>So. </p></p></p></center>
<p>He holds up a small odd-shaped stone. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>We need to put this in your brain. </center>
<p>Spike stares at the peach-pit sized stone. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>(no way)<br/>Bugger that. 
      <p>GILES<br/>S'alright. It's completely painless.<br/>(then)<br/>So I'm told. 
      The Prokaryote stone<br/>will help unlock your subconscious to<br/>get to 
      the root of the trigger's<br/>power. Help you understand it.<br/>Hopefully, 
      break its hold over you. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Hopefully. So it might not work. 
      <p>GILES<br/>The stone's only a catalyst for the<br/>process. The rest is up 
      to Spike.<br/>He needs to overcome whatever mental<br/>weakness is allowing 
      his brain to be<br/>manipulated this way. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>And how'd you expect to get that hunk<br/>of rubble into my 
      cranium? </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles turns to Willow, holding the box out to her. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Willow... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>'kay.<br/>(muttering)<br/>Just hope my pronunciation's in 
      the<br/>ballpark. </p></center>
<p>She reads from the book and subtly waves her hand over the stone and

<p>CLOSE ON THE STONE as it begins to unfurl, into a black, undulating 
      leech-like creature. 
      <p>Everyone looks at it somewhat repulsed. 
      <p>ON SPIKE, eyeing the creature. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You've got to be joking.<br/>(to Giles)<br/>What now? In 
      the ear? Up the<br/>nostrils? 
      <p>GILES<br/>It has to enter your cerebral cortex<br/>through the optic 
      nerve. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Oh, bollocks-- All the rubbish<br/>people keep sticking in my 
      head...<br/>it's a wonder there's room for my<br/>brain. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I don't think it takes up that much<br/>space, do you? 
</p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles brings the box up to Spike's face. 
      <p>CLOSE ON SPIKE, tense, as the Prokaryote slithers out of the box and 
      onto his cheek, quickly working it's way to his eye. There it begins to 
      flatten out and worms its way into his eye socket. 
      <p>Spike JERKS as it enters him. He CRIES OUT in pain and thrashes a bit 
      against his chains. The group makes various GASPS of revulsion. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Spike -- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(grossed out, but<br/>lightly)<br/>Ah! The eye's have 
      it!<br/>(off looks)<br/>I know. A personal low. </p></center>
<p>Buffy rushes to Spike's side, takes his hand. Tries to calm him. He 
      thrashes as the Prokaryote vanishes into him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Listen to me. It's okay. Spike? </center>
<p>ON SPIKE, breathing hard, as he looks down, looking inward. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Yeah... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You all right? </p></center>
<p>He nods, rattled. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>How'm I suppose to know if this bug<br/>ugly's doin' 
      its--</center>
<p>He stops as he's hit with a ray of sunlight, he looks up and around, 
      somewhat amazed. Widen to see he's in... 
      <p>INT. LONDON TOWNHOUSE - 1880 - FLASHBACK - DAY 
      <p>We ARC around Spike's shoulder to find 
      <p>WILLIAM (Spike's pre-vampire self) standing across from a frail, 
      sickly, elderly woman, sitting on a large upholstered chair in the 
      upscale, elegantly furnished parlor; a handkerchief is clutched in her 
      hand. This is Spike's mother, ANNE. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM<br/>(reading)<br/>"...her eyes, balls of 
      honey/angel's'<br/>harps, her laugh/oh, lark, grant a<br/>sign/if crook'd be 
      cupid's shaft..." </center>
<p>CUT IN on ANNE as she listens raptly, a gentle smile on her face, her 
      needle-point lying on the arm rest next to her. A pitcher of water and a 
      glass on the end table beside her. 
      <p>ON WILLIAM, continuing to recite from a few sheets of parchment in his 
      hands. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM (cont'd)<br/>(reading)<br/>"Hark, the lark/her name it 
      hath<br/>spake/'Cecily' it discharges/from<br/>'twixt its wee beak." 
      </center>
<p>He pauses, then glances up at Anne, indicating he's finished. She 
      stares at him a moment. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>Oh, William... 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>It's just scribbling. 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Nonsense. It's magnificent. </p></p></center>
<p>He eyes her skeptically, shaking his head. Then, enthusiastically 
      pleased, he sits on the sofa beside her. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM<br/>Honestly? You really think so,<br/>Mother? 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Oh, yes. You've a rare gift. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Would that certain publishers thought<br/>as you. 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Well, you mustn't be disheartened.<br/>They're envious. Clearly, 
      you're a<br/>man before your ti-- </p></p></p></center>
<p>She's caught by surprise by a hacking cough, which ends as abruptly as 
      it came. William reaches for her water glass to hand to her, but she waves 
      him off. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE (cont'd)<br/>I wonder though... 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Wonder? 
      <p>ANNE<br/>This "Cecily" of whom you write so<br/>often... Would that be 
      the<br/>Underwoods' eldest girl? 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>(embarrassed)<br/>Oh, no, I don't presume - 
      <p>ANNE<br/>She's lovely. And you shouldn't be<br/>alone. You need a woman 
      in your life. </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He looks at her. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM<br/>I have a woman in my life. 
      <p>ANNE<br/>(intrigued)<br/>You, what? You've 
      never--<br/>(understanding)<br/>Oh. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Do not mistake me -- I have hopes<br/>that one day there will 
      be an<br/>addition to this household...<br/>(beat)<br/>But I will always look 
      after you,<br/>Mother. This I promise. </p></p></center>
<p>Anne smiles, looks at him with love. 
      <p>Anne begins to COUGH. She covers her mouth with her handkerchief. 
      William jumps to his feet and brings her the glass of water, helps her as 
      she gasps it down, soothing her tortured throat. It's then he glances at 
      <p>INSERT - Blood stain on the handkerchief in her hand. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM (cont'd)<br/>Shall I send a coach for Dr. Gull? 
      <p>ANNE<br/>(recovering)<br/>No. No, I'll be all right. It's...<br/>it's 
      passed. Just sit with me a<br/>while, will you? 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Of course. </p></p></center>
<p>He sits on the floor at his mother's feet, resting against her legs. 
      Anne picks up her needle-point again and starts to resume her work as she 
      sings. 
      <p>SLOW CREEP IN as Anne begins to sing, softly, sweetly... 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>(singing)<br/>EARLY ONE MORNING, JUST AS THE SUN<br/>WAS 
      RISING, I HEARD A MAID SING IN<br/>THE VALLEY BELOW...</center>

      open to find he's back in the basement, surrounded by the others (Buffy is 
      still at his side, holding his hand). 
      <p>Before anyone realizes what's happening, Spike bursts up with animal 
      fury. He hits Buffy, tossing her hard across the room. 
      <p>Spike lunges forward, SNARLING, held back by his chains. He struggles a 
      bit, then violently picks up his cot and flings it across the room, 
      hitting Dawn, knocking her to the ground. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Dawn!</center>
<p>She goes to help Dawn as Buffy rights herself. She's about to take on 
      Spike when he freezes, almost stunned. She hesitates.

      over with shame and guilt at 
      <p>HIS POV - BUFFY, shaking off her injuries. DAWN, sitting up with a big, 
      bleeding gash on her temple as Willow tends to her.

      <p>Willow tends to Dawn's head injury on the couch. Xander, Andrew, Anya, 
      Kennedy and Rona look on. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>(touching Dawn)<br/>Does that hurt? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Ow. Yes. 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>I can't believe there was a Wrath of<br/>Khan moment 
      downstairs and I missed<br/>it. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(confused)<br/>Did Ricardo Montalban throw a bed 
      at<br/>somebody? </p></p></p></center>
<p>Andrew seriously thinks about this. 
      <p>
<center>ANDREW<br/>In the movie or in real life? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(confused)<br/>What? 
      <p>ANDREW<br/>Wait. What are we talking about? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You two are making my head angry. </p></p></p></center>
<p>THE PHONE RINGS, Andrew moves off to answer it as Willow dabs Dawn's 
      wound again.

<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/><u>Ow</u>. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Sorry.<br/>(beat)<br/>Doesn't looks like anything's broken... 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Did you do some sort of magic x-ray? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>No, just usually the thing people say. 
      <p>KENNEDY<br/>So Spike's trigger's been active this<br/>entire time. 
      <p>RONA<br/>How could Buffy take that for<br/>granted? He lives in our 
      house. We<br/>train with him. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Oh, don't waste your time down that<br/>road. Spike's got some 
      sort of "Get-<br/>Out-Of-Jail-Free" card that doesn't<br/>apply to the rest 
      of us. He could<br/>slaughter a hundred frat boys and he-- </p></p></p></p></p></p></center>

<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON 
      <p>Spike is agitated, thought slightly dazed. His arms are still chained. 
      Buffy, Giles and Wood look on. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Get me out of these sodding things<br/>already! I'm fine. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Don't you think you should take a<br/>little time first. To 
      calm down. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I <u>am</u> calm.<br/>(to Giles)<br/>Stone o'yours is out, 
      in'it? Did its<br/>job. So, I'm de-triggered, right? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Spike. What do you remember? About<br/>the song... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Yeah. The song. 's called "Early<br/>One Morning." Old folk 
      ditty... 
      <p>WOOD<br/>What's it mean to you? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Mean? Nothing. Just...<br/>(then)<br/>My mum... </p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Wood tenses at that. The group doesn't notice. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>It was her favorite. She used to<br/>sing it to 
      me.<br/>(self-conscious)<br/>When I was a baby. 
      <p>GILES<br/>And...? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>No "and." That's it. </p></p></center>
<p>He looks to Buffy, changing the subject. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Shouldn't you be checking on Dawn?<br/>Clocked 
      the niblet pretty fierce. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>She'll be okay. She's tough. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(pressing forward)<br/><u>Listen to me</u>, Spike. What is 
      it<br/>about your mother-- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I dunno. We got on fine. She was a<br/>good lady. 
      <p>GILES<br/>There has to be more to it than-- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(snapping)<br/>Well, there bloody well isn't. </p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They stand there at an impasse for a few moments. Then, Buffy moves to 
      Spike. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>What are you doing? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm going to unchain him. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy -- </p></p></center>
<p>He takes her and pulls her to the side. They speak in hushed whispers, 
      out of Spike's earshot. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Giles, this is pointless. He doesn't<br/>know anything. 
      Your prophylactic<br/>stone didn't work. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Because he's not cooperating. The<br/>process takes time. He's 
      blocking<br/>whatever's flooding into his<br/>consciousness, and as long as 
      he does<br/>so, we're in danger. </p></center>
<p>Wood appears next to him. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>So the trigger's still working? 
      <p>GILES<br/>As much as ever. </p></center>
<p>As Wood takes that in, he looks over at 
      <p>HIS POV - SPIKE, lost in thought, oblivious to their conversation. 
      <p>ANGLE ON SPIKE as he jerks his left arm, straining against the shackle, 
      then suddenly looks at his hand.

      twirling about, laughing as they kiss. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA<br/>Ooh, such a pretty house you have,<br/>sweet Willy. 
      Smells of daffodils and<br/>viscera. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Don't get too attached, now. Won't<br/>be here for long, 
      love. 
      <p>DRUSILLA<br/>Well, then... </p></p></center>
<p>She sweeps over to the couch. Sits down seductively. 
      <p>
<center>DRUSILLA (cont'd)<br/>Shall we give it a proper good-bye? 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>You are a saucy one, aren't you? </p></center>
<p>He plops down next to her, pulling her to his lap and they kiss, 
      passionately. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM (cont'd)<br/>Oh, Dru... we'll bring the world to<br/>its 
      knees... 
      <p>DRUSILLA<br/>It's ripe and ready, my darling.<br/>Waiting for us to 
      devour its fruit.

      of Europe.<br/>The three of us will teach the snobs<br/>and elitists with 
      their falderal just<br/>what-- 
      <p>DRUSILLA<br/>Three? 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>You, me and Mother. We'll open their<br/>veins and bathe in

      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Well... yeah.<br/>(then)<br/>You'll like her. 
      <p>DRUSILLA<br/>To eat, you mean? </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>

      <p>
<center>ANNE (O.S.)<br/>William? </center>
<p>He looks to see Anne at the entrance to the parlor, in her bed clothes, 
      leaning on her WALKING STICK. 
      <p>Startled, William leaps off the couch like a guilty teenager. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Mother... 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Where have you been? I've been<br/>beside myself with worry 
      for<br/>days... </p></center>
<p>William crosses to her, almost swaggering. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM<br/>You needn't have worried, Mother.<br/>You never have to 
      worry about<br/>anything again. Something... has<br/>happened. I've changed. 
      </center>
<p>Anne, eyeing his disheveled appearance. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>What have you been doing? I don't--<br/>(re: 
      Drusilla)<br/>Who... Who is this woman? 
      <p>DRUSILLA<br/>I'm the other that gave birth to<br/>your son. 
      <p>ANNE<br/>I beg your pardon. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>It's true, Mother. Drusilla --<br/>She... She's made me what 
      I am. I'm<br/>no longer bound to this mortal coil.<br/>I have become a 
      creature of the<br/>night. A vampire. </p></p></p></center>
<p>Anne stares at him, bewildered. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>Are you drunk? 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Little bit.<br/>(moving to her)<br/>Think of it. No more 
      sickness. No<br/>more dying. You'll never age another<br/>day. Let me do 
      this for you. </p></center>
<p>William reaches out to touch her, but she recoils. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>What are you talking about? Why are<br/>you acting so 
      strange... 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>It's still me, Mother. Your William.<br/>(beat)<br/>Though Dru 
      here seems determined to<br/>give me a pet name... 
      <p>DRUSILLA<br/>Yes. Like Willy. Or Bill. Or<br/>Lucien, Prince of Lies. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>That's enough, Dru. I think you're<br/>scaring Mother. 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Please. I don't find this amusing... 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>It's all right, Mother... It's only<br/>me. </p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He reaches out and holds her. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM (cont'd)<br/>We'll be together forever. </center>
<p>ON ANNE as we hear William MORPH. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>William... </center>
<p>ON WILLIAM, in VAMPFACE, holding his mother (she cannot see his face). 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM<br/>(softly)<br/>It only hurts for a moment. </center>
<p>He SINKS his teeth deep into her neck. We hold for a beat on the two of 
      them, Spike and his mother, over which we hear: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (PRE-LAP) Buffy... </center>
<p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - BASEMENT - PRESENT - AFTERNOON 
      <p>ON SPIKE as he jerks out of his flashback. He looks over at 
      <p>WILLOW standing on the stairs, addressing Buffy, still standing with 
      Giles and Wood. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Just got a phone call. I gotta take<br/>off for a little 
      while, maybe a day<br/>or so... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Is something wrong? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Nothing you need to worry about.<br/>I'll give you the full 
      scoop later.<br/>Hopefully I'll bring back some good<br/>news. </p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks at her a moment, then glances at Spike. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Could use a little of that...<br/>(shrugs)<br/>Okay. Guess 
      now's as good a time as<br/>we're likely to see for a while.<br/>Just hurry 
      back. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Will do. </p></center>
<p>Willow heads back upstairs. Buffy starts off toward Spike, talks (out 
      of earshot) with him. Giles watches her with displeasure. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>(sotto)<br/>Mr. Giles... </center>
<p>Giles stops and turns toward him. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>D'you have a moment? </center>
<p>Giles watches the pair exit upstairs, then nods. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>What's on your mind? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Same thing that's on yours.<br/>(looking at the top<br/>of the 
      stairs)<br/>We got a problem. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(understanding)<br/>Spike. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Look, I know I'm an outsider to you<br/>people. And you don't 
      know me at<br/>all. But I'm fighting for the same<br/>reasons. Against the 
      same enemy. So<br/>hear me out... 
      <p>GILES<br/>Go on. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I think something has to be done. </p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles squints at him. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I'm not sure I-- 
      <p>WOOD<br/>You said it yourself. If the<br/>trigger's still working, The 
      First<br/>must be waiting for the right time to<br/>use it against us. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(thinking it through)<br/>Does seem doubtful The First 
      simply<br/>forget it had such a powerful weapon. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>A while back it slipped up, told<br/>Andrew "it wasn't time yet 
      for<br/>Spike." Whatever The First's<br/>ultimate plan is, Spike must play 
      an<br/>integral part.<br/>(with emphasis)<br/>Something. Needs. To be done. 
      </p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles stares at him, understanding Wood's meaning. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Buffy would never allow it. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>She'd listen to her Watcher, wouldn't<br/>she? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes, well, apparently you don't know<br/>very much about the 
      Watcher/Slayer<br/>dynamic. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>As a matter of fact, I was raised by<br/>a Watcher. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(genuine surprise)<br/>You what? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Bernard Crowley. Took me in when I<br/>was a young boy. Trained 
      me. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(searching his memory)<br/>Crowley... Yes... I remember 
      the<br/>name. New York based Watcher.<br/>Resigned shortly after his 
      Slayer<br/>was--</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He stops as a realization hits him, and stares at Wood. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>You're Nikki Wood's son. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Yes. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Spike killed your mother. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Yes. </p></p></p></center>
<p>A beat as Giles sizes him up. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Does Buffy know this? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>She knows my mother was a Slayer.<br/>She doesn't know about 
      Spike. 
      <p>GILES<br/>And this has nothing to do with<br/>personal vengeance. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Does it matter?<br/>(pause)<br/>He's an instrument of evil. 
      He's<br/>going to prove to be our undoing in<br/>this fight. Buffy's 
      undoing. And<br/>she's never gonna see it coming. </p></p></p></center>
<p>PUSH IN as WOOD brings home his case. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>I'm talking about what needs to be<br/>done. For 
      the greater good. You<br/>know I'm right. </center>
<p>SLOW PUSH IN on Giles, processing this. Then: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>What... exactly are you proposing? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I just need you to keep Buffy away<br/>for a few hours. 
</p></center>
<p>GILES looks at him for a long time. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - KITCHEN/HALLWAY - AFTERNOON 
      <p>Wood crosses into frame outside the kitchen. He glances into the 
      kitchen and sees Spike rummaging through the freezer. 
      <p>He turns to look down the hallway to where Giles is talking to Buffy in 
      the foyer. We can't hear them, but Buffy is clearly skeptical of whatever 
      Giles is telling her. 
      <p>Wood watches for a moment, then casually walks into the kitchen. Spike 
      pulls a bottle of whiskey from deep in the back. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>After this afternoon, I could use a<br/>drink myself. And I 
      didn't have<br/>insects rummaging around in my brain. </center>
<p>Spike takes a long drink straight from the bottle and then offers it to 
      Wood, who accepts. He takes a small drink. The two pass it back and forth 
      for the duration of the scene. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Been talking to Giles. He has some<br/>things he 
      needs to talk to Buffy<br/>about -- Slayer/Watcher-type things,<br/>I 
      guess... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>And? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Well, there's concern about stepping<br/>out -- even for a bit 
      -- as you're<br/>not exactly stable enough to leave... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(exhausted, annoyed)<br/>Yeah, okay, I get it. Look, 
      that<br/>leech-thing did a number on me but...<br/>I'll be fine. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Sure...<br/>(beat)<br/>It just strikes me that there may 
      be<br/>better places than a house full of<br/>young, potential victims for 
      you<br/>to... work through your issues. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>What'd you got in mind? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Got stacks and stacks of occult books<br/>on mind-control back 
      at my house that<br/>may help us speed this along.<br/>Besides, if 
      anything... bad does<br/>happen there's only me to injure,<br/>and, well, 
      I'm willing to take the<br/>chance. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You sure about that? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>(affable)<br/>I'll keep a close eye on you. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and Giles walk through the graveyard. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I dunno, Giles. Is this really primo<br/>time for a 
      training session? 
      <p>GILES<br/>I'm still your teacher, Buffy. And,<br/>no matter how adept a 
      Slayer you are,<br/>there'll always be new things to<br/>learn. Now more 
      than ever it's<br/>crucial to maintain focus upon your<br/>calling. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're talking to me like I'm sixteen<br/>again. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Sometimes the most effective way of<br/>moving forward is to 
      start at the<br/>beginning. </p></p></p></center>
<p>They come to a stop near a fresh grave. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>In case you haven't noticed, our<br/>plates are kinda full 
      right now.<br/>Plus, not sure how I feel about Robin<br/>looking after Spike 
      at his place. 
      <p>GILES<br/>For what it's worth, everyone in your<br/>house seemed quite 
      relieved by the<br/>arrangement.<br/>(then)<br/>Buffy, I may not technically 
      be your<br/>Watcher anymore... But the fact that<br/>there's chaos in your 
      life only<br/>underscores the importance of the<br/>lessons I can impart to 
      you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(shrugging)<br. <p="" away.="" fine.="" impart="">GILES<br/>We are on the 
      verge of war. It's<br/>time to start looking at the big<br/>picture. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hello! All I <u>do</u> is look at the big<br/>picture. The 
      other day I gave an<br/>inspirational speech to the telephone<br/>repairman. 

      <p>GILES<br/>Takes more than rousing speeches to<br/>lead, Buffy. If you're 
      going to be<br/>a general, you need to make the<br/>proper decisions, 
      regardless of cost. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Have you seen me with those girls?<br/>The way I've treated my 
      friends and<br/>family? And Andrew. Believe me, I<br/>know how to make the 
      hard decisions. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, that's what we're here to find<br/>out... </p></p></p></p></br.></p></p></center>
<p>Behind them, a HAND breaks through the ground. They turn and look at 
      it. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>While we work on the basics.</center>
<p>EXT. WOOD'S GARAGE - MEANWHILE 
      <p>Wood and Spike (wearing his duster) approach the padlocked side door of 
      Wood's garage. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Live in a garage? </center>
<p>Wood starts unlocking the padlock. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>This is just my work room. Kind of<br/>my... sanctuary. 
      </center>
<p>He unlocks the door, starts to open it. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Little place to unwind, huh... </center>
<p>Wood enters, followed by Spike. 
      <p>INT. WOOD'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Darkness. We barely make out Spike entering as Wood hangs back. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Hard day's principal-ing got you<br/>down, need a place to 
      cut loose, let<br/>down your hair...<br/>(beat)<br/>So to speak. </center>
<p>Wood shuts the door. We're in darkness. We hear a ch-chunk as he locks 
      the door behind him. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>(friendly)<br/>Something like that... </center>
<p>Wood switches on the light. 
      <p>The walls of the garage are covered in CROSSES. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>What the bloody hell's this? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>(shrugs)<br/>I told you. My sanctuary. It's the<br/>Hellmouth, 
      Spike. Never be too<br/>careful.</p></center>
<p>As he talks, Wood walks over to a COMPUTER WORKSTATION in the corner of 
      the garage. Nearby is a BOOKCASE filled with books. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Stay away from the walls. You'll be<br/>all right. 
      </center>
<p>Spike looks around the room. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Bit much, in'it?<br/>(eyeing Wood)<br/>What's your story, 
      Wood? </center>
<p>Wood's back is to Spike. He hits a key on his computer and the screen 
      comes to life. He types as he talks (we don't see what he's typing). 
      Spike's spider sense is starting to tingle. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>No story, really. Trying to do<br/>what's right, make a 
      difference. </center>
<p>Wood looks over his shoulder. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>How 'bout you? What kind of man are<br/>you, 
      Spike? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Sorry. Not much for the self-<br/>reflection. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Makes sense... </p></p></center>
<p>Wood looks at the computer again. Seems satisfied with what he's 
      looking at. He pulls open a large drawer that's part of the workbench the 
      computer sits on. 
      <p>Carefully laid-out weapons line the drawer -- knives, swords. And two 
      ARM BRACES. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>You strike me as the type of guy who<br/>careens 
      through life completely<br/>oblivious to the damage he's doing 
      to<br/>everyone around him. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(bristling)<br/>That right? 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I know more about you than you think,<br/>Spike. I've been 
      searching for you<br/>for a very... very long time. </p></p></center>
<p>Wood looks over his shoulder, makes eye contact. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>Ever since you killed my mother. </center>
<p>ON SPIKE - Spike's on his guard now, watching Wood closely, though not 
      seeing any imminent threat. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Killed a lot of people's mothers. </center>
<p>Wood turns back around. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>Oh, you'd remember mine... </center>
<p>As he talks, he fastens the metal braces onto his arms. One runs the 
      length of his forearm, with a brass-knuckle-type extension at the hand and 
      a studded spike at the base of the elbow. The other brace is smaller -- it 
      fills over the hand like a wrist protector. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>She was a Slayer. </center>
<p>Spike tenses up, ready to fight. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>So, that's it, is it? Brought me<br/>here to kill me? 
      </center>
<p>He turns and faces Spike. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>No. I don't want to kill you, Spike.<br/>I know you're 
      different now.<br/>Changed. That you've got a soul.<br/>(shaking his 
      head)<br/>I don't want to kill you.<br/>(beat)<br/>I want to kill the monster 
      who took<br/>my mother from me. </center>
<p>He reaches down and hits a key on his computer. "Early One Morning" 
      begins to play out of his surround-sound speakers. 
      <p>Spike looks around, tenses. A look of fear crosses his face right 
      before he MORPHS into vampface. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>(matter of fact)<br/>Oh. There he is.</center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LONDON TOWNHOUSE - 1880 - FLASHBACK - 
      NIGHT 
      <p>CLOSE ON the door in the foyer as William enters, he crosses into the 
      parlor, which seems darker now, the lighting sparse. He looks over at the 
      sofa. 
      <p>HIS POV - Anna is gone, though blood stains remain on the upholstery 
      where she'd lain. 
      <p>ON WILLIAM, looking around. Sees her walking stick propped up by the 
      fireplace. He calls out: 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM<br/>Mother...? </center>
<p>With that, he suddenly hears a music box, playing "Early One Morning." 
      He turns toward the darkness from which it emanates. 
      <p>Anne crosses into the light, smiling, holding the music box. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>Hello, William. </center>
<p>Her sickly shuffle's gone -- she moves at a steady gait. Her hair's 
      down and her face has a healthy flush. She still bears the neck wounds of 
      William's bite. 
      <p>ON WILLIAM, he grins at the sight of Anne's robust self. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM<br/>Look at you... 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Mm. Yes. All better. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>You're glowing. </p></p></center>
<p>She focuses on the music box, almost dreamily. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>Am I? I suppose I have you to thank<br/>for that, don't 
      I?<br/>(looks up at him)<br/>How ever will I repay you? 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Seeing you like this is payment<br/>enough. 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Oh, William. You're so... tender. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>This is as it should be, Mother. You<br/>and I, together. All 
      of London laid<br/>out before us. 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Ahh, yes. Us. </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Her eyes drift as she smiles to herself. She places the music box down 
      and closes it. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM<br/>First we'll feast. And then the<br/>night is yours. The 
      theater perhaps.<br/>Dancing... Tell me, what's your<br/>pleasure? 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Pleasure? To take my leave of you,<br/>of course. </p></center>
<p>William's face falls. What? A cruel smile breaks out on Anne's face. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE (cont'd)<br/>"The lark hath spake from twixt its<br/>wee beak." 
      You honestly thought I<br/>could bear an eternity listening to<br/>that 
      twaddle? </center>
<p>INT. WOOD'S GARAGE - PRESENT - NIGHT 
      <p>CRACK! WOOD lands a hard punch across Spike's face. Though somewhat 
      disoriented from the memories rushing through his brain, a feral Spike 
      SNARLS and moves to strike back at Wood. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>That's right, dog. Bite back. </center>
<p>Wood deflects Spike's attack and jabs Spike in the jaw with his studded 
      elbow. 
      <p>INT. LONDON TOWNHOUSE - 1880 - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 
      <p>Anne slowly moves about the townhouse, drinking everything in. William 
      watches her, frightened and confused. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>I do feel extraordinary. It's as<br/>though I've been given 
      new eyes. I<br/>see everything. Understand...<br/>(her eyes land on 
      him)<br/>Everything. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Mother- 
      <p>ANNE<br/>I hate to be cruel -<br/>(stops/realizing)<br/>No. I used to hate 
      to be cruel. In<br/>life. Now I find it quite freeing.<br/>Nothing less will 
      pry your greedy<br/>little fingers from my apron strings,<br/>will it? 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Stop, please. 
      <p>ANNE<br/>The way you've clung since the day<br/>you first slithered from 
      me. Like a<br/>parasite. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>What are you-- 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Had I known, I would have dashed your<br/>brains out the moment 
      I saw you.<br/>Spared myself a lifetime of tedium. </p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>OMITTED 
      <p>OMITTED 
      <p>INT. WOOD'S GARAGE - PRESENT - NIGHT 
      <p>CRACK! Wood slams Spike right in the face. He SLAMS Spike back against 
      the cross-laden wall with one braced arm across his throat, the other 
      pummeling him in the midsection. Smoke rises as Spike burns, howling. 
      <p>INT. LONDON TOWNHOUSE - 1880 - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 
      <p>William now backs away from Anne - shaking his head. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>God, how I prayed you'd find a woman<br/>to release me. But 
      you scarcely<br/>showed an interest. Who could<br/>compare to your 
      doddering, housebound<br/>mum? A captive audience for your<br/>witless 
      prattle? </center>
<p>INT. WOOD'S GARAGE - PRESENT - NIGHT 
      <p>Wood presses Spike's face against the crosses. His cheek sizzles and 
      burns. Spike shoves Wood off him, sending him sailing. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>(snarling)<br/>NNOOO!! </center>
<p>He lunges at Wood. 
      <p>INT. LONDON TOWNHOUSE - 1880 - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 
      <p>William steps in to Anne. 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM<br/>Whatever I was... That's not who I am<br/>anymore. 
      <p>ANNE<br/>(cutting)<br/>Darling... It's who you'll always be.<br/>A limp, 
      sentimental fool. </p></center>
<p>INT. WOOD'S GARAGE - PRESENT - NIGHT 
      <p>CRACK! Wood kicks Spike hard in the face, blasting him back. 
      <p>SPIKE slams back into the bookcase, breaking shelves. Wood looms over 
      him and starts to pound him with punishing blows to the face. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>Hurts, don't it? This what it felt<br/>like?<br/>(punches 
      him)<br/>When you beat the life out of her?<br/>(punch)<br/>Toyed with 
      her?<br/>(punch)<br/>Before you snapped her neck?! </center>
<p>One last hard punch that takes us to 
      <p>EXT. CEMETERY - MEANWHILE 
      <p>CRASH! A NEW VAMP flies into frame, smashing into a large tree. Before 
      he can recover, BUFFY's on him. She grabs his lapels and flips him onto 
      his back. She straddles him, whips out her stake, about to finish him off, 
      when: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Don't kill him yet. </center>
<p>Buffy stops short. She and the New Vamp look over at him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What? Why not? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Because I'm asking you not to. </p></center>
<p>Buffy and the Vamp share a look. She shrugs, elbows the Vamp in the 
      face then rolls off of him. As they square off again: 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>Would you let this vampire live if it<br/>meant 
      saving the world? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(shrugs)<br/>Sure. Why not.<br/>(re: Vamp)<br/>Seems like a nice 
      enough guy. 
      <p>VAMP<br/>Thanks...? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No problem. You from around here? 
      <p>GILES<br/>(frustrated)<br/>Buffy. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hey, I'm just saying -- if he's gonna<br/>save the world, we 
      should get to know<br/>him a little better. 
      <p>VAMP<br/>(awkward)<br/>My name's Richard. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hi, Rich. </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She slams him with a right cross. They trade blows as she and Giles 
      talk. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>And would you let him kill me, if it<br/>meant the same? 
      </center>
<p>The Vamp hesitates, looking at Giles. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP<br/>Uh... I'm cool with that. </center>
<p>Buffy palms him in the head to regain his attention. The Vamp attacks 
      again. Buffy casually fights back. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>We've had this conversation before,<br/>Giles. When I told 
      you I wouldn't<br/>sacrifice Dawn to stop Glory from<br/>destroying the 
      world. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Things are different now, aren't<br/>they? After what you've 
      been<br/>through. Knowing what you're up<br/>against. Faced with the same 
      choice<br/>now... you'd let her die. </p></center>
<p>Buffy hesitates, as she realizes her answer. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>If I have to. To save the world...<br/>(quietly)<br/>Yes. 
      </center>
<p>The Vamp spin kicks her in the head. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Ouch! Can I kill this guy yet? 
      <p>GILES<br/>No. </p></center>
<p>Frustrated, Buffy starts wailing on the Vamp. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>So you really do understand the<br/>difficult 
      decisions you'll have to<br/>make. That any one of us is<br/>expendable in 
      this war... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Have you <i>heard</i> my speeches? 
      <p>GILES<br/>That we can't allow any threat that<br/>may jeopardize our 
      chances of<br/>winning. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yes. I get it. </p></p></p></center>
<p>A beat as Giles watches Buffy and the Vamp trade blows. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>And yet, there is Spike. </center>
<p>Buffy pauses in her assault to look at him. The Vamp uses the 
      opportunity to tackle her out of frame. 
      <p>INT. WOOD'S GARAGE - MEANWHILE 
      <p>ON WOOD, getting to his feet, breathing hard, staring down at 
      <p>SPIKE, propped up against the toppled bookcase, bruised and bloodied, 
      lost in torrents of memory swimming around in his head. 
      <p>As he speaks, Wood strips his mother's coat from Spike's body. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>Animal like you... Never cared for<br/>anyone but 
      yourself... </center>
<p>He folds the coat over his arm, lays it gently on the table. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD (cont'd)<br/>No one else mattered... Just... all<br/>about the 
      hunt... </center>
<p>ON WOOD as he reaches over to a SMALL WOODEN CROSS mounted among the 
      others on the wall and with a bit of effort, yanks it from its mooring. 
      <p>ON SPIKE, hearing voices in his head. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE (PRE-LAP)<br/>You want to run, don't you? </center>
<p>INT. LONDON TOWNHOUSE - 1880 - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 
      <p>Anne has William backed against the fireplace again. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>Scamper off and cry to your new<br/>little trollop. You 
      think you'll be<br/>able to love her? You think you'll<br/>be able to touch 
      her without feeling<br/>me? </center>
<p>She grasps her walking stick... 
      <p>
<center>ANNE (cont'd)<br/>All you ever wanted was to be back<br/>inside. And 
      you finally got your<br/>wish, didn't you? Sank your teeth<br/>into me, an 
      eternal kiss- 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>No. I only wanted to make you well. </p></center>
<p>Now she grows darkly seductive. Moving closer still. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>You wanted your hands on me. Perhaps<br/>you'd like to 
      finish what you<br/>started, hum? 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Please -- </p></center>
<p>WILLIAM, terrified, pressed against the wall, on the verge of tears. He 
      can't meet his mother's stare. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>Come on Willy, have a go before we<br/>part. One to 
      remember me by. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>I loved you. I did. Not like this-- </p></center>
<p>Anne watches him squirm, a cruel smile on her face. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>Just like this. This is what you<br/>wanted all along. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Stop it -- 
      <p>ANNE<br/>Come on. Do it.<br/>(baby talk)<br/>Who's my little dark prince? 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>No! </p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike shoves her. Hard. She stumbles back. Grows cold. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE<br/>Fine. Then gather up your tears and<br/>get out of my 
      house. 
      <p>WILLIAM<br/>Mother-- 
      <p>ANNE<br/><u>Get out</u>! </p></p></center>
<p>And as she says this, she grabs her walking stick and SWINGS. William, 
      cowering, blocks the blow, catching the cane before it hits. As they 
      struggle for possession of it, we hear a SNARL and he looks at 
      <p>ANNE, now in vampface, sneering at him. 
      <p>
<center>ANNE (cont'd)<br/>There, there, precious. "It will<br/>only hurt for 
      a moment." </center>
<p>The walking stick slams against the mantle, snapping it in two. As 
      William and Anne stay close, struggling... 
      <p>
<center>WILLIAM<br/>I'm sorry...</center>
<p>INT. WOOD'S GARAGE - PRESENT - NIGHT 
      <p>Wood hesitates. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>What? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(muttering to himself)<br/>I'm sorry. </p></center>
<p>INT. LONDON TOWNHOUSE - 1880 - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 
      <p>William plunges the shard of the walking stick into his mother's chest. 

      <p>ON ANNE - She gasps and looks up at him, DEMORPHING back to her human 
      face. For a moment, there's a glimmer of the kind, gentle loving woman she 
      was before being turned. 
      <p>William registers this as the DUSTS and falls away... 
      <p>INT. WOOD'S GARAGE - PRESENT - NIGHT 
      <p>Wood raises the cross to plunge into Spike's heart, when suddenly 
      SPIKE's hand flies up and grabs Wood's arm. 
      <p>ON SPIKE, who peers up, NO LONGER IN VAMPFACE. A look of revelation on 
      his face. Without a word, he kicks Wood square in the chest, sending him 
      reeling backward. 
      <p>As SPIKE jumps to his feet, resolved... 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>You think "sorry" is gonna make<br/>everything right? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Wasn't talking to you. </p></center>
<p>Wood launches an attack on Spike, but this time he's having a hard time 
      making contact as Spike deflects each blow. Spike swings around with a 
      kick to Wood's head, dazing him. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>I don't give a piss about your mum.<br/>She was a 
      Slayer. I was a vampire. </center>
<p>Wood attacks, Spike hits him again. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>That's the way the game's played. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Game?! </p></center>
<p>Wood strikes back, again with little result. Spike unleashes a couple 
      of punishing blows. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>She knew what she was signing up for. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>I didn't sign up for it. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Well, that's the rub, in'it?<br/>(beat)<br/>You didn't sign up 
      for it, and<br/>somehow that's my fault. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>You murdered her. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>She sure loved you, didn't she?<br/>Enough to risk her life, 
      night after<br/>night... </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Wood throws punches that Spike dodges and deflects. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>You took my childhood...<br/>(punch)<br/>...when you took 
      her from me.<br/>(punch)<br/>She was all I had. She was my world. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You weren't hers. Doesn't it piss<br/>you off? </p></center>
<p>Wood hesitates, wincing at that. Then comes at Spike again. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>Shut up. You didn't know her. </center>
<p>Spike ducks a swing, then pummels Wood, who's beaten to his knees. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>I know Slayers. No matter how many<br/>people they got 
      around them, they<br/>fight alone. Life of The Chosen One.<br/>Rest of us be 
      damned. Your mum was<br/>no different.</center>
<p>A weary and beaten Wood looks at Spike, with desperate defiance. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>She... She loved me. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>So she said, I expect. Not enough to<br/>quit, though, was it? 
      Not enough to<br/>walk away. For you. </p></center>
<p>Wood lies broken and bloody on the floor, unable to respond. 
      <p>ON SPIKE, after a moment, letting the air settle. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Tell you a story. 'Bout a mother and<br/>a son. 
      Like you, I loved my mum. So<br/>much so, I turned her into a vampire<br/>so 
      we could be together forever.<br/>(beat)<br/>She said some nasty bits to me 
      after<br/>I did that. Been weighing on me for<br/>quite some time... 
      </center>
<p>He paces, thinking it through. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>But you helped me figure something<br/>out. You 
      see, unlike you, I had a<br/>mother who loved me back. When I<br/>sired her, 
      I set loose a demon and it<br/>tore into me... but that was the<br/>demon 
      talking, not her. I realize<br/>that now.<br/>(pause)<br/>My mum loved me 
      with all her heart.<br/>I was her world. </center>
<p>He walks over to the computer. Hits a key. "Early One Morning" begins 
      to play again. Spike listens, relaxed. Unaffected. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Nice little song you got there... </center>
<p>He listens a bit more, then hits a key. Stops the music. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Thanks, doc. Cured me after all. </center>
<p>He crosses over to Wood. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Got my own free will now. I'm not<br/>under The 
      First, or anyone else's<br/>influence anymore. </center>
<p>ON WOOD staring up at Spike looming over him. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (O.S.)<br/>Just wanted you to know that... </center>
<p>ON SPIKE as he MORPHS into VAMPFACE. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>...before I kill you. </center>
<p>He grabs Wood's shirt, yanks him up and bites into him and we...

      <p>WHAM! Buffy hits the Vampire who accepts the blows, wearily. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Spike is a liability, Buffy. He<br/>refuses to see that. 
      And so do you.<br/>Angel left here because he knew how<br/>harmful your 
      relationship with him<br/>was. Spike, on the other hand, lacks<br/>such 
      self-awareness. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spike's here because I want him here.<br/>We need him. I'm in 
      the fight of my<br/>life. 
      <p>VAMP<br/>Really...? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Not you, Richard. </p></p></p></center>
<p>She hits him hard. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>You want Spike here even after what<br/>he's done to you 
      in the past? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's different. He has a soul now. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes, and The First seems to be<br/>exploiting it to his 
      advantage. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Exactly. The First's doing this.<br/>Spike's innocent. 
</p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles pauses a moment, then: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>So was Ben. </center>
<p>Buffy stops cold. The Vamp launches at her and she WHIP-STAKES him to 
      DUST. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Ben? 
      <p>GILES<br/>(with difficulty)<br/>He was a human being, after 
      all.<br/>Forced, his whole life, to share his<br/>mortal form with a 
      demi-god from a<br/>hell-dimension. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Glory. I know. What does that have<br/>to do-- 
      <p>GILES<br/>Ben was oblivious to the atrocities<br/>Glory committed. No 
      more responsible<br/>for her crimes than Spike is to his,<br/>when 
      triggered. </p></p></p></center>
<p>SLOW PUSH IN as he continues... 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>Glory was invincible, impossible to<br/>kill... 
      Ben was not. So after you<br/>defeated her. After you left Ben<br/>lying 
      there. Alive. I made a<br/>decision. One that you couldn't. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Giles... 
      <p>GILES<br/>I put my hand over his mouth. And as<br/>he struggled, 
      weakly... I smothered<br/>him. Because it had to be done.<br/>(looks at 
      Buffy)<br/>He was a liability. </p></p></center>
<p>Buffy's eyes go wide as she starts to put it together. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh god... You've been stalling me.<br/>Keeping me away-- 
      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy, it's time to stop playing the<br/>role of a general and 
      start being one. </p></center>
<p>Buffy stares at him in shock, then turns and runs... 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>(calls after her)<br/>This is the way wars are 
      won. </center>
<p>OMITTED 
      <p>EXT. WOOD'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>The side door swings open and Spike steps out into the night, pulling 
      on his coat. He moves to walk away, then hesitates as he hears: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>Spike! </center>
<p>Buffy runs into frame, anxious. She sees his wounds, tries to touch his 
      face, check him over. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Are you okay? </center>
<p>He pushes her hands away. Leave me be. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>What happened? </center>
<p>He turns, pushes open the door behind him. It swings open to reveal 
      Wood, battered and bloody, slumped against the wall. His head rolls as he 
      regains consciousness. Though he's seen better days, he's clearly still 
      alive. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>(whispered)<br/>Oh my god... 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I gave him a pass. Let him live. On<br/>account of the face 
      that I killed his<br/>mother. </p></center>
<p>She looks at him, begins to figure it out. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>But that's all he gets. </center>
<p>He turns, begins to walk away. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>He so much as looks at me funny<br/>again... I'll 
      kill him. </center>
<p>Buffy watches him go, then turns toward the garage. 
      <p>INT. WOOD'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Buffy walks into the garage. Wood sees her, tries to get to his feet. 
      She goes to his side to help him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I lost my mom a couple years ago. I<br/>came home and 
      found her dead on the<br/>couch. </center>
<p>Wood wipes the blood from his mouth. 
      <p>
<center>WOOD<br/>(softly)<br/>I'm sorry. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I understand... what you tried to do.<br/>But she's dead. He 
      killed her. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>She got herself killed. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And none of it matters. We're<br/>preparing to fight a war, and 
      you're<br/>looking for revenge on a man who<br/>doesn't exist anymore. 
      <p>WOOD<br/>Don't delude yourself. That man<br/>still exists... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Spike's the strongest warrior I have,<br/>and we need him if 
      we're going to get<br/>through this alive.<br/>(then)<br/>If you try anything 
      again, he's going<br/>to kill you, but more importantly,<br/>I'm going to 
      let him. </p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Wood looks down -- he can't bring himself to meet her gaze. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I have a mission: to win this war,<br/>save the 
      world. I don't have time<br/>for your vendettas. </center>
<p>She turns her back on him, begins to walk away. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>The mission's what matters. </center>
<p>And she leaves him. Alone. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - DAWN'S BEDROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT 
      <p>Dawn, head bandaged, lies fast asleep in her bed. 
      <p>ANGLE ON BUFFY, sitting on the edge of the bed, looking at her. She 
      brushes a strand of hair from her face, caresses her cheek, then rises and 
      exits. 
      <p>INT. SUMMERS' HOME - HALLWAY/BUFFY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Buffy walks into the hall and moves toward her bedroom when: 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.S.)<br/>Buffy... </center>
<p>She glances back to see 
      <p>GILES at the other end of the hallway. 
      <p>BUFFY turns back and walks through the doorway to her room. Giles 
      follows. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I understand your anger... but please<br/>believe me when 
      I tell you we did<br/>what we did for the good of all -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(without turning)<br/>He's alive, Giles. Spike's alive.<br/>Wood 
      failed. </p></center>
<p>Giles processes this. Then: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>That changes nothing. What I said to<br/>you before is 
      still true. You need<br/>to learn -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No... </p></center>
<p>Buffy turns and addresses him face to face in her doorway. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I think you've taught me everything<br/>I need to 
      know. </center>
<p>And with that, she closes the door in his face.
