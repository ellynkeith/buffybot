<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. ROCKET CAFE - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Open on GIRLS. Really cute ones. Lots of em. 
      They're in various stages of getting lunch at the U.C. Sunnydale dining 
      hall. A diet soda here, a small salad there. We hear:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST (O.S.)<br/>Women. Young, 
      nubile, exciting.<br/>Each one a mystery waiting to be unlocked.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: RILEY FINN, looking studious, is 
      busily marking a pile of papers with his squeaky red pen. Half-listening 
      to his pal FORREST, an athletic-looking sophomore, who drops the suave guy 
      talk:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Think any of them 
      are going to show?<br/>'Cause the party'll be lame if we lack<br/>for 
      hotties. Hey. Professor. You with me?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(not looking 
      up)<br/>No, I'm with this large pile of ungraded papers<br/>due at three 
      o'clock</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>How are you going to 
      learn anything if you keep<br/>doing schoolwork? Oh. Check her out. Is she 
      hot<br/>or is she hot?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Forrest points with his fork. Riley just 
      manages to look up. We see what he sees:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">On line. Not her best day. She fills up her 
      glass. Soda fizzes up and over the sides. She bends down to slurp the 
      excess.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>She's 
Buffy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Buffy. I like 
      that.<br/>(Trying it on)<br/>"That girl's so hot, she's Buffy."</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>It's her name 
      Forrest.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>You've established 
      first contact? Excellent,<br/>what do you think of her?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I never really thought 
      of what I think about her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>A girl that cute in 
      the face and you've formed<br/>no opinion?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No, I mean.. .She's 
      all right ,I guess.<br/>She's just kind of, I dunno... Peculiar.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Peculiar.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Uh huh.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And a very fully loaded tray hits the table 
      as GRAHAM joins the guys. Graham, a Muscle-y mountain of a senior, sits, 
      adjusts, and shovels forkloads of food in his face.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Hey Graham. What do 
      you think of the<br/>blond chick? Mattressable, n'est pas?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They watch as Buffy pulls hard on the yogurt 
      machine's metal handle- and it comes off in her hand</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Graham nods noncommittally.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST (cont'd)<br/>Riley's not 
      down. Doesn't like her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I don't dislike her. 
      She just never feels<br/>like she's really there when you talk to her.<br/>I 
      like girls you can get a grip on.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>I'll bet you 
      do.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Not that way. Just a 
      little less ready for<br/>takeoff all the time.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy tries several way to fit the broken 
      yogurt handle back on. Never gonna happen. The yogurt keeps 
      coming....</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY (cont'd)<br/>There's 
      definitely something off about her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Maybe she's 
      Canadian.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks around, thinks no one is 
      looking. Tosses the handle into the salad bar and moves on. Playing 
      innocent.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Didn't she go out 
      with Parker Abrams for<br/>like thirty seconds?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(a bit bothered by 
      that)<br/>Abrams? Yeah, there's a sign of good taste...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy moves on, pretending not to notice the 
      students behind her having to deal with massive yogurt-flow. She 
      pays...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Okay. But you've got 
      to admit she's a<br/>major league hottie.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm not denying she's 
      easy on the eyes,<br/>I'm just saying...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They watch as Buffy walks away fast - and 
      smashes into a student coming the other way. His tray goes crashing to the 
      floor.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY (cont'd)<br/>.... Would 
      you really want to go out with her?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Hell yes! I bet 
      there's a lot of guys who'd<br/>like to get their hands on her.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And on that thought we CUT TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. LABORATORY/SPIKE'S CELL - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Close up of SPIKE, barely conscious. Harsh 
      fluorescent light bathes him from overhead. He looks terrible, even for a 
      vamp. Paler than usual, lips dry and cracked.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (mumbling)<br/>Slayer ... 
      kill you ... not so tough,<br/>I ... kill ... Slayer ...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We pull back to see he is trapped inside a 
      futuristic, sterile, all white cell. Clear plane of plexiglass where bars 
      would be. Spike wakes up. His eyes go wide.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike moves forward, edging up near the 
      plexiglass, and the second he touches it - BZZT! A small blue spark of 
      electricity sends him staggering back. Spike glares at the plexiglass with 
      an expression we've never seen on his face before. Fear. As he looks 
      around his new home, we:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Pull back, out of the cell. We see that 
      Spike is not alone. His is just one of a long, endless row of cells. A few 
      guys in lab coats work quietly, as commandoes walk purposefully through 
      the complex.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And just when you think it can't keep going. 
      It keeps going. Still pulling back. There's no end to this place. It just 
      goes on, cell after cell after cell, all of them perfectly sterile and 
      clean and white.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And we're still pulling back....</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Giles holding a sketch pad, finishes a 
            charcoal drawing as Xander pores over thick supernatural text 
            books.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>There, based on 
            Buffy's description, I believe<br/>the men we're after look something 
            like<br/>... this.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He turns the pad over, showing Xander 
            the sketch. It's a COMMANDO. Ski mask, camouflage pants, rifle by 
            his side.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>The latest in 
            fall fascism, I like it.<br/>A little full in the hips for my taste, 
            but...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I think we can 
            safely assume they're human.<br/>So, no need to research.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>No studying... 
            damn!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He slams the big book shut.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Next 
            you'll tell me I have to eat jelly<br/>doughnuts or sleep with a 
            supermodel<br/>to get things done around here. I ask<br/>you - how 
            much can one man give?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Not very much, 
            I'm afraid. It seems, once<br/>Again, you and I won't be needed to 
            help Buffy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(disappointed)<br/>Really?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Really.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They both sigh. A beat. Then Xander 
            lights up.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Well, then how 
            about this: we whip out the<br/>Ouija board, light a few candles, 
            summon<br/>some ancient unstoppable evil - Mayhem<br/>Mayhem Mayhem - 
            we show up, kick its ass.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>That might be 
            unethical.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy enters, sees the 
            sketch.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hey guys. Ooh, 
            look. It's my late night<br/>stormtrooper pal.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>It's just for 
            reference. But you'd say<br/>it's fairly accurate?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's your 
            man.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Your man, 
            actually. You are patrolling<br/>tonight?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Nope. I am going 
            to a party tonight.<br/>Hopefully, a "no fighting, no biting"<br/>kind 
            of deal.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Someone's got to 
            find out what those<br/>people are --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Giles, I'm in a 
            dorm now filled with<br/>what the young people these days 
            call<br/>"young people". The girls in my hall want<br/>to party, I'm 
            taking Willow, try to cheer her up.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>How's Will 
            doing with the ...?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>... The black 
            hole of despair she's lived in<br/>since Oz 
            left?<br/>(Shrugs)<br/>She's dealing, I'm helping. It's hard. 
            Ergo,<br/>party.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Buffy, I 
            appreciate your loyalty to a friend,<br/>but this...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(re: 
            sketch)<br/>Look. No horns, no claws, no slime. The<br/>bad guy's just 
            a guy, so you two can take<br/>patrol. Now if you'll excuse me, I 
            have to<br/>pick out something slutty for tonight.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She leaves. Pause.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Well, looks like 
            we got our work cut out<br/>for us after all.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Beat, then Xander puts his hands 
            behind his head, reclining.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Sweet.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. LABORATORY/SPIKE'S CELL - 
            DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike paces his cell like a hungry 
            tiger. Thinks to test the Plexiglas again - then thinks better of it 
            - continues pacing. Suddenly he jumps at an ear-shattering horn 
            blast</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A small hatch in the ceiling opens and 
            a clear plastic bag shoots out, onto the cell floor - plop! It's 
            filled with dark red liquid. Spike grabs it, tears it open with his 
            teeth, almost drinks, but stops when he hears a frightened voice 
            call:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TOM 
            (O.S.)<br/>Don't!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike looks around to see where the 
            voice is coming from. Can't. Starts in on the blood 
again.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TOM (cont'd; 
            O.S.)<br/>Don't drink it. It's drugged.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike puts the packet down.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Uh-huh. And who 
            are you, mate?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">For the first time we see:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. TOM'S CELL - INTERCUT 
            DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He is haggard, and clearly 
            terrified.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TOM<br/>(laughs 
            eerily)<br/>I'm a rat. I'm a lab rat - like the others<br/>(scared 
            whisper)<br/>They're gonna kill us, you know.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>And how are 
            "they" going to do that?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TOM<br/>They starve you. 
            And when you're ready to bite<br/>your own arm, they shoot out one of 
            those packets.<br/>You drink, and the next thing you know - 
            you're<br/>gone. That's when they do the experiments.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike looks around the cell, probing 
            it for weaknesses. There are none.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>And "they" are 
            .... the government? Nazis?<br/>A major cosmetics company?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TOM<br/>Who cares? All I 
            know is, one minute I'm<br/>running from the Slayer, and the next 
            thing,<br/>I'm here...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>The Slayer. I 
            knew it. I KNEW IT!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TOM<br/>She took apart my 
            crew and drove me straight<br/>to these guys.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>She set me up, 
            too!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike hurls a fist smashing into the 
            Plexiglas, setting off a shower of sparks.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>I 
            always worried what would happen if the<br/>bitch got some funding. 
            She wised up a bit.<br/>Fine. I'll take her apart - I don't care 
            how<br/>brilliant she is.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy. In class, lost in a sea of 
            confusion, staring at her own two hands. Which are covered in 
            ink.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Stupid 
            pen...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She rips a sheet out of her spiral 
            notebook, wipes her hands on it. Then realizes:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Oh, my 
            notes!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Ballpoints are 
            tricky.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A bell signals the end of class. 
            STUDENTS file out. Buffy and WILLOW collect their books and head out 
            with the other students. Willow stops at Riley's lecture 
            desk.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hey. Riley. Hi. 
            Um, I noticed you left a<br/>name off the role call today. 
            Osbourne.<br/>Daniel Osbourne? Oz.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>He's not in this 
            class anymore. I heard he<br/>dropped out.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh, you heard 
            way wrong then. He's not<br/>gone. He just left temporarily - to 
            work<br/>out a few things.<br/>(beat)<br/>That sounds lame in its 
            vagueness I know,<br/>but I assure you, Oz will be back.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH<br/>Not to my 
            class he won't.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They turn to see Maggie standing with 
            them. Willow starts to speak. Maggie silences her with one raised 
            finger.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH (cont'd)<br/>An 
            educated guess: You know the rules. You<br/>know I hate exceptions. 
            And yet you feel your<br/>exception is exceptional.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh, 
            but...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH<br/>It is. To 
            you. But, since I'm neither a<br/>freshman or a narcissist, I have 
            the whole<br/>class to consider. If your friend can't<br/>respect my 
            schedule, I think it's best he<br/>not come back.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow starts to protest. Then, 
            choking on emotion, she leaves. Buffy watches. Then calmly she 
            approaches Maggie.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You know, for 
            someone who teaches human<br/>behavior? You might try showing 
            some.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Maggie can't quite believe that 
            one.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH<br/>It's not my 
            job to coddle my students.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's right. A 
            human being in pain has<br/>nothing to do with your job.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy walks out. Maggie collates 
            papers.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH<br/>I like 
            her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Really?<br/>(beat)<br/>You don't think she's a little 
            peculiar?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. XANDER'S BASEMENT ROOM -

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Boom! Xander lays out various items of 
            military equipment on the rec table. Backpacks. Canvas belts. Flare 
            guns. Flashlights. Canteens. Knives.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Here we go. 
            Gear for tonight. If some commando<br/>squad's out there fully 
            loaded, these babies might<br/>give us the edge we'll 
need.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Very impressive. 
            Where'd it all come from?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Requisitioned 
            it back when I was military guy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>That was over 
            two years ago. Are you sure<br/>you're still a hundred 
            percent?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">As he answers, Xander tries loading a 
            cartridge into a flare gun. First he can't get it open. Then he 
            loads the cartridge backward. Tries again. Won't fit. He keeps 
            trying...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You kidding? I 
            put the "semper" in semper fi.<br/>Maybe I can't assemble an M-16 
            blindfolded<br/>like I used to. Or pass weapons drill for 
            the<br/>mobile infantry...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Giles loads the cartridge for him. 
            It's easy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Might 
            as well face it - right now I don't have<br/>the technical skills to 
            join the Swiss army.<br/>And all those guys make you do is uncork 
            a<br/>couple of sassy cabernets.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I'm sure you'll 
            be ready when the time comes.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Fear not. Hand 
            to hand? I'm still the man. Let's<br/>hit it. Remember: Whoever these 
            guys trained<br/>with, there's no way they're ready to deal with 
            ...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER'S MOM 
            (V.O.)<br/>Xander!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(swallowing 
            shame)<br/>Yeah, Mom?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER'S MOM (V.O.)<br/>I 
            made up a nice fruit punch for you and your friend.<br/>Would you 
            boys like some?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander looks embarrassed. Giles looks 
            a little hopeful.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Raspberry fruit

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. COMMONS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley is in the commons with his boys. 
            He and Graham carry on a room-spanning game of Frisbee while he 
            talks to Forrest by his side.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>So she says, 
            "You teach human behavior,<br/>maybe you ought to show 
            some."</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>You are lying. 
            She said this to Walsh?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Hope to 
            die.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Oh, like 
            you've never wanted to tell the<br/>Professor off.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He spots Parker, approaching with a 
            pal.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST (cont'd)<br/>Oh, 
            hey, Parker!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He eagerly accosts him, Riley somewhat 
            less eagerly folding in also, Frisbee in hand.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Forrest, what's 
            up?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>What's the 
            scoop on Buffy Summers? Is<br/>she cool?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Buffy? She's 
            all right, I guess. I mean,<br/>kinda whiney...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Graham folds in as well, the Frisbee 
            game over.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>How's 
            that?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Well, you know, 
            clingy... I mean we got a little<br/>physical - well, fully physical 
            - and then she's<br/>all over me, you know, like we're betrothed 
            or<br/>something.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>But fun was 
            had, yeah?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Oh yeah! The 
            word is stamina.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Guy laughter from all but Riley, who 
            looks puzzled.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PARKER 
            (cont'd)<br/>Definitely a bunny in the sack, but later on...<br/>Well, 
            you know the difference between a<br/>freshman girl and a toilet 
            seat... toilet seat<br/>doesn't follow you around after you use it 
            --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley punches Parker in the face and 
            knocks him cleanly onto his ass.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">For a moment nobody moves.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. CAMPUS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Forrest and Graham are walking Riley 
            outside. They are both a tad wigged -- Riley is tense but also still 
            puzzled.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I can't believe 
            I did that.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Welcome to the 
            club! You have any idea<br/>how much trouble you could've gotten 
            into?<br/>If Parker reported you -</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>He won't. He's 
            too embarrassed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I hit 
            him.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>What the hell 
            for?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>He was just 
            being so crude...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Please! You've 
            heard me say much grosser<br/>things than that --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>-- and a lot of 
            those were about your own mom!<br/>What is it that...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He stops.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY (cont'd)<br/>I just 
            didn't like hearing him talk that way about<br/>Buffy. I think I ... 
            well I guess I like her.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Forrest smiles knowingly.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>You're kind of 
            like a moron.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>So you knew that 
            I had feelings for her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Everybody 
            knows, man...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>'Oh, she's

            me...'</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm always the 
            last to know.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>So whatchya 
            gonna do?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He thinks a moment.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Guess I'm gonna

            faces, only their lab coats and the large syringe they're preparing) 
            come down a clean white corridor. Stop at Spike's cell. Inside, 
            Spike lies passed out, the empty plastic bag beside him.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">One technician inserts a plastic 
            keycard. A set of lights beside the cell door turn from red to 
            green. The glass slides aside. They enter. Lift the unconscious 
            Spike out of his cell, load his limp form onto a medical gurney. 
            They start to strap him down when Spike's eyes snap open.</font></p>

            DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A blaring ALARM flashes red light. 
            Just beneath it, Spike stands locked in a death-struggle with one 
            technician who holds him by the throat. Spike's howling in pain. The 
            other technician, fumbling, uncorks a syringe.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Aaah!!!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The first technician shoves Spike up 
            against the adjacent cell's Plexiglas front. Spike's electrified. 
            Inside the cell, TOM rushes into sight.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TOM<br/>Let me 
            out!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Bit busy just 
            now ...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TOM<br/>I know where the 
            exit is. You spring me,<br/>you're free. You don't, and you're 
            dead.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike grabs the technician's arm, 
            spins him. Just as the second technician shoves the syringe deep in 
            his back. The first technician's out cold instantly. Drops to the 
            floor. The second one sees Spike's vamp face and runs.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TOM 
            (cont'd)<br/>Hurry!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike takes the keycard from the 
            unconscious guard. Inserts it in front of Tom's cell. The light 
            turns from red to green. Tom slides the door open.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TOM (cont'd)<br/>This 
            way.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They run. The alarm's still blaring. 
            Reach a pneumatically self-sealing door. Tom runs underneath. Spike 
            slides like a base runner, just making it through as the door hits 
            the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. STERILE WHITE HALLWAY - 
            DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike and Tom turn a corner, running 
            right into an ARMED GUARD. Spike smashes his elbow into the guy's 
            masked face at the same time the guard rifle-butts Spike in the side 
            of the head. Spike grabs his head, bellowing in pain. Tom grabs the 
            gun. Tasers the guard.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The guard hits the ground convulsing. 
            The vamps keep going, running under another metal door which hisses 
            shut behind them.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: THE OTHER END OF THE 
            HALL</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">As Spike and Tom run down it toward an 
            elevator, on either side of it two more doors shutting automatically 
            one by one, sealing off any hope of escape.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The elevator door opens revealing MORE 
            ARMED GUARDS equipped with stun-guns and gas-masks.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>New plan: we 
            split up.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike shoves Tom right into the pack 
            of guards, who are knocked back into the elevator. They grab him, 
            struggle, Tom fighting and flailing.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>You go 
            that way.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike dives and rolls under the last 
            pneumatic door as Tom is staked, exploding into dust behind him. The 
            door hisses shut. Sealed.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley walks down Buffy's dorm hall, 
            passing a group of giggling girls, past blasting hip-hop, to Buffy's 
            door. Slow, sad music comes from inside. Riley hesitates, then 
            knocks.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (O.S.)<br/>Come

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley enters. Willow's just sitting on

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Hi. Gee, I hope

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow shuts off the music.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What's 
            up?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Right to the 
            point. Okay. I was thinking of<br/>asking out Buffy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>She's not 
            here.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I know. See, I 
            don't know much about Buffy.<br/>But I'm interested in what she 
            likes, and so<br/>far, the only thing that I know she likes is 
            you.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">As Riley talks, Willow's eyes go wide. 
            She's just noticed Buffy's open bag of weapons lying on the floor. 
            Stakes everywhere. She puts her foot next to the bag and starts 
            sliding it under the bed without getting noticed ...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But what do you 
            want me to do?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And she keeps sliding those weapons,

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Just tell me 
            something. Anything, some kind of<br/>clue to ... here let me help 
            you with that.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Without looking, he shoves the weapons 
            bag under the bed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY 
            (cont'd)<br/>Something to start us talking. I'm thinking<br/>"How

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(big 
            sigh)<br/>Okay. Let's say I help. And you start a<br/>conversation. It 
            goes great. You like Buffy.<br/>She likes you. You spend time 
            together.<br/>Feelings grow deeper, and one day without<br/>even 
            realizing it, you find you're in love.<br/>Time stops and it feels 
            like the whole world's<br/>made for you two and you two alone until 
            the<br/>day one of you leaves the other and rips the<br/>still-beating 
            heart from the other who's now a<br/>broken, hollow mockery of the

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">(Beat.)</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Yep. That's the

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I figured it 
            was.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Look, if you 
            wanna tell me to go to hell that's<br/>okay... Maybe this is the last 
            thing you wanna<br/>talk about. I just feel like -- well I've 
            never<br/>courted anyone like Buffy before. I don't think<br/>I've 
            ever met anyone like Buffy before.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Why should I 
            trust you?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I was just

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I've seen

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>All right, I

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>What?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'm not saying 
            it's the key to her heart, but<br/>Buffy? She likes 
cheese.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>That's a

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>And she has a

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Then that will

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(polite

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>That's

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The CDs land on a pile of eclectic

            pours gasoline on the pile. Tries lighting a match.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She leaves. A moment, and Riley moves 
            to a place where Buffy is in view.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. LOWELL HOUSE - 
            ANOTHER AREA - CONTINUOUS</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: Riley. Getting himself 
            together. He approaches Buffy. Taps her on the shoulder. She turns 
            to face him</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Hey, Willow said 
            to say she took off.<br/>(Off Buffy's look)<br/>She's okay. Kind of 
            blue, but said not to worry.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Thanks.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You know, I

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Ask 
            away.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley smiles, starts to speak. Then 
            suddenly Xander enters, breathless, puts his hand on Buffy's 
            shoulder pulls her away.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He spots Riley staring.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Need 
            to talk. Not here. It's sort of, uh,<br/>unfinished

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Business. 
            Right,<br/>(to Riley)<br/>Excuse us?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No 
            problem.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She leaves with Xander. Riley watches. 
            Forrest and Graham approach.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Denied.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>It's not like

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>We need you 
            downstairs anyway.</font></p>

            ROOM CONTINUOUS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">It's pretty messy, but empty. They 
            close the door behind them, talking casually as they cross to a 
            mirror, preen in it. Forrest checks his look. Graham touches a 
            hidden button on one side of the mirror. Over all this:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>You know I 
            hate to say this but they're<br/>probably on their way to make

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Is that

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">As the talk, a thin line of bright 
            green light passes over their faces. An incongruous-sounding 
            COMPUTER VOICE speaks.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">COMPUTER VOICE<br/>Retinal

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The mirror slides aside, revealing

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>I like her. I'm 
            on your side here.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I know you are,

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They enter the elevator. The mirror

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The guys ride the elevator like

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>... and that's

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Exactly! Girls, 
            plural. I'm talking about one girl.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The elevator stops. Riley leans in to 
            speak directly into a microphone panel.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY (cont'd)<br/>One.

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Camera pulls up and back panning 
            around to reveal just what the guys are walking into. This is THE 
            INITIATIVE. An underground laboratory beneath the streets of U.C. 
            Sunnydale. Futuristic., all-white, clinical. Overhead, metallic 
            catwalks crank into place. Transport vehicles pull into view. 
            SCIENTISTS carrying clipboards scurry past.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The three guys barely notice, keep 
            walking past...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY (cont'd)<br/>And

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Maybe a

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The boys walk past THE PIT: a fully 
            functional, sunken operating theater bathed in white light. Three 
            upright tables can be seen on the floor below. On table one, 
            strapped down, there's a horned demon. He bellows as scientists in 
            lab coats inject him with a dark fluid. On table two, a 
            strapped-down VAMPIRE is jolted with metallic prods as technicians 
            calmly mark down his response time. On table three, KULAK of the 
            MIQUOT CLAN, eyes wide in terror, watches as surgeons prepare to 
            remove one of his protruding head scales.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Having passed the pit, Riley stops 
            short. His face goes serious. We see what he sees: Maggie

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Things happen fast. A TRANSPORT 
            VEHICLE pulls into frame. Mesh lockers on its bed. As Riley, Forrest 
            and Graham talk, all three guys suit up for combat, pulling 
            equipment from their lockers without ever looking. It's all second 
            nature. They hook on kevlar vests, sheathe knives, check weapons, 
            pull on sweaters and attach electronic headgear. As they gear up, we 
            can see Riley's uniform is distinct. Grey where the others are 
            green. His larger headset has a wireless microphone, and bandolier 
            of small canisters straps across his chest. Maggie, framed by a bank 
            of video monitors on the edge of the pit (each monitor showing a 
            demon experiment) leads the discussion, rapid-fire.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Another TRANSPORT pulls into frame. 
            Sitting on its flatbed, battle suited and ready for combat, are SIX 
            AGENTS. All dressed alike. Commandos. They leap off the transport as 
            it slows without stopping and split off into three groups of three, 
            standing at attention awaiting orders.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley takes center, speaks with total

            commands.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>We start with a

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">An electrical supply shed. It reads 
            "WARNING - HIGH VOLTAGE." A panel is lifted aside - from the inside. 
            Riley, Forrest and Graham move out. Graham reattaches the panel and 
            they disappear into the night. No sign they were ever there. We hear 
            a voice:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I am the plan.

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She starts out.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Wait. Take

            table hit the floor, sending office supplies scattering. Pan up to 
            Spike, his face lit by eerie green glow of a computer monitor. 
            Typing. P.O.V.: On the monitor a list of names scroll under the 
            heading "STEVENSON HALL." Finally SUMMERS, BUFFY comes up. Spike

            Dressed like Joe Regular college guy (tee and jeans, all of which

            beams pierce the darkness, dancing over doorways and the occasional 
            startled student. They move quickly, relentlessly forward, finally 
            converging on Buffy's dorm room door.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley silently signals. Graham unloads 
            a two-foot metal battering ram from his backpack. Grabs the handles 
            and readies himself. Riley holds up three fingers. Two. 
            One.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">WHOMP! Graham smashes the door in, 
            splintering wood off the hinges. They all three point their rifles

            room.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">It's empty.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Until Willow gets shoved out right 
            into the guys, scattering them. Forrest is knocked to the ground. 
            Leaps back to his feet with instant cat-like reflexes. Lifts his 
            rifle, aims gets Willow dead in his sights.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Hold your 
            fire!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike comes leaping out after Willow, 
            full vamp-face, attacking. He lands on Graham, grapples with 
            him.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>It's on 
            me!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike tries sinking his teeth in 
            Graham. Again, the searing pain stops him. Spike rears back his head 
            and howls.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley jams a thick canvas hood over 
            Spike's head. Pulls a leather strap shut, tight around the neck. 
            Pulls Spike back, off Graham. Forrest gets in there instantly, 
            trying to cuff Spike's hands behind his back. Spike pulls free. 
            Makes a two step run for it before running into the brick wall that 
            is Graham. Graham punches Spike so hard that it doubles him over and 
            sends him reeling to the ground.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Bag and tag it - 
            we're gone.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Graham reaches down with one hand and 
            lifts the limp Spike back up into frame. Starts marching him down 
            the hall. Forrest stops. Doubles back. Pulls Willow by the 
            arm.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Sir!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley turns. Sees Willow. And behind

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">As they argue, Spike breaks free of 
            his cuffs. Rips off the canvas hood. Clips Graham right behind the 
            knees and the big man goes down, hitting the floor with a thundering 
            crash. Spike makes a run for it. Riley nails him.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley slams Spike up against the wall, 
            pins him there. But with his one free hand, Spike smashes open the 
            glass on the fire extinguisher. Grabs it. Forrest fires his taser at 
            Spike. Misses. Hits the metal canister instead. It explodes a heavy 
            foam mist, filling the a ten-foot-square section of the dorm 
            hallway. A cloud.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow turns, stumbling, away from the 
            mist. Choking and coughing, eyes, watering, she feels her way along 
            the wall heading for her room. Graham, running into the mist, 
            yells:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Stop 
            her!</font></p>

            this.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Forrest whirls. P.O.V. : Through the 
            green visor of his night vision goggles, we see what Forrest sees: a 
            racked-focus shot of the business end of a flare gun - pointing 
            right in his face. PAF! The gun fires and the whole screen flares 
            out super-bright. Blinding.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Giles and Xander, armed with stakes 
            and crossbows, survey the sky, waiting for a flare.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY AND WILLOW'S DORM HALL - 
            NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The flare itself (CGI?) bounces 
            crazily around the hallway, bouncing off of ceiling and walls. The 
            commandoes all give a pained yell as they grab for their 
            visors.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Yaahhh!! I'm 
            blind!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>What the hell 
            is that?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy doesn't hesitate. She 
            round-house kicks Forrest in the head, sending him staggering into 
            the wall. Buffy grabs Willow and shoves her into the dorm room, out 
            of range.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Go.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She slams the door shut. Turns back to 
            see ...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">THWOCK! Graham comes flying out of the 
            extinguisher mist, landing heavily on his back. Spike emerges from 
            the cloud, his vamp-face a mask of pain.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy pulls out a stake, ready to hurl 
            it straight into his chest. When a black-clad arm pulls her back, 
            out of sight.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike looks around at the chaos around 
            him. Cloud to left. Slayer fighting commando to the 
right.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Too 
            weird.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike makes a run for it down the hall 
            ...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: Buffy breaks free of the 
            arm-grip holding her. Turns. Faces Riley. He's masked. And blind - 
            one hand still cast over his eyes. Neither one knows who they're 
            fighting. Buffy clocks him with a left hook. Then hits him with an 
            overhand right. Then goes back for another left. Riley catches the 
            wrist.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He twists. Buffy flips over and down, 
            hard, to the floor. She returns the favor, flipping him over 
            herself, back down the hall. They continue to fight, neither of them 
            able to see very well...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike makes it to the end of the hall 
            and - CRASH! - goes cannonballing out the window, sending glass and 
            wood shattering.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. BUFFY AND WILLOW'S DORM - 
            NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike hits the ground hard, hurt. He 
            looks up winces, grabbing his battered ribs. Beaten ansdbruised, 
            Spike runs limping away, towards the woods, wounded and cursing 
            ...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY AND WILLOW'S DORM HALL 
            NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy gives Riley a solid blow. He 
            lands on his back. The mist is dissipating now, filling the entire 
            hall with a thick layer of fog.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">P.O.V. shot: we see what Buffy looks 
            like through Riley's eyes. A blob of dark in the misty 
            light.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Graham and Forrest are by the window, 
            looking out at where Spike ran.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Hostile's 
            escaped, sir!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Orders?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Abort!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He scrambles back and joins his men. 
            They exit the hall. Buffy watches, when:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">With an electronic hum, the lights 
            come back on. With multiple, repeating "Click!"s, all the dorm doors 
            unlock. Slowly, one by one, students poke their heads out dorm 
            rooms. Buffy looks around at the war zone of a dormitory.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow steps out. Holding her neck. In 
            shock. Without a word Buffy checks to see she's all right. She is. 
            Buffy leads Willow back inside. Closes the battered door.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">DISSOLVE TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLOSE UP of Maggie Walsh.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH<br/>I'm sure 
            you'll understand if I seem far from<br/>happy.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She's standing in the Initiative, at 
            the edge of the pit, the bank of video monitors behind her. Riley, 
            Forrest, Graham and the rest of the commando squad stand around for 
            the debriefing. They're sweaty. Exhausted. Their uniforms are half 
            off, like a team after the big game.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Yes ma'am. If 
            you read my report you'll see...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH<br/>Hostile 
            Seventeen's found an accomplice who's<br/>smart, aggressive, and

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>The implant

            way without<br/>intense neurological pain.<br/>(beat)<br/>We'll bag 
            it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PROF WALSH<br/>Yes, you 
            will. Dismissed.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They all head out, towards the stairs. 
            Riley last. He hesitates, wanting to say something, then thinks 
            better of it. Marches up slowly towards the elevator...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. QUAD - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A bright, beautiful sunny day on 
            campus. Buffy walks, by herself. Riley catches up to her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Hey.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hi.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Listen, sorry 
            about last night.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No, I was rude 
            -</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No -</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Just felt like 
            being alone. Sometimes, at night,<br/>it's nice to be out by 
            yourself.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I hear that. 
            Gotta be careful though. Lotta strange...<br/>people out 
            there.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh 
            yeah.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>How's Willow 
            doing?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay. 'Course 
            that stupid fraternity prank on our<br/>hall didn't help 
            any.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>That's right, 
            you guys live in Stevenson.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>How'd you know 
            that?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Well, Willow and 
            I were... I thought she might<br/>be able to help me on a 
            project.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Really? That 
            work out?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Don't know 
            yet.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Was there 
            something -- at the party, you wanted to<br/>tell me 
            something?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Oh yes. Very 
            important stuff. Interesting, a little<br/>edgy, daring views on... I 
            don't remember any of it<br/>now, but you would have been fascinated, 
            possibly<br/>very moved... Did Willow tell you I like 
            cheese?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy stops, looks at Riley like she's 
            seeing him the first time.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You're a little 
            peculiar.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1"><font face="verdana" size="-1">Riley 
            smiles; he knows what that means.</font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I can live with that.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1"><font face="verdana" size="-1">They resume 
            walking, deeper into the campus. Frisbees are thrown. Students run 
            off to class, leaflets are handed out. And Buffy &amp; Riley are 
            part of the colorful picture. They disappear together, two free 
            students on a beautiful day.</font></font></p><font face="verdana" size="-1">BLACK OUT END OF SHOW
