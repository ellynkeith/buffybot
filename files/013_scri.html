<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Please. I'm so over 
      her.<br/>(REAL casual)<br/>Did she, uh, say when she was getting <br/>back, 
      about which I don't care?<br/><br/>WILLOW<br/>I haven't heard from her. I

      can I say? It makes your nose look <br/>tasty. </font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He daubs it with a napkin (he has the only 
      one or she would). And again, yeah, they're pretty close, her arm on his 
      shoulder, looking at each other, then less looking than 
      gazing...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE UP: THEIR FACES</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Come pretty close, right into the awkward 
      almost-kiss-zone. A moment, and they stop, their heads separating. 
      </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There is a vampire right between them. 
      Leering, ravenous, and practically in the kiss zone himself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's on the other side of the wall from 
      them, the dirt and the tux hanging on him speaking of a fresh rising. The 
      kids see him and start back -- Willow clumsily jumping from the wall -- he 
      easily vaults it, coming swaggeringly at them.</font></p>

      her)<br/>Willow, go!<br/><br/>WILLOW<br/>Xander --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The vampire jumps him. He steps back and 
      slugs it -- but it isn't phased, grabbing his neck and pulling him in for 
      the kill. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow desperately searches about for some 
      kind of weapon, finally grabbing the vampire's arm, trying to wrench him 
      off Xander --</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A HAND clamps down on the vampire's 
      shoulder. Pulls back and spins him around, straight into the path of a 
      lightning fist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The punch is followed by a roundhouse kick 
      -- and another. The vampire finally gets time enough to lunge at the 
      figure -- who easily FLIPS him onto the ground, turning to the others.

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The vampire rears up behind her and without 
      looking back she SLAMS her foot into his chest, sending him flying back 
      --</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: A TREE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">with a broken branch sticking out of it. The

      As we track with him, we see the Master's skeleton laid out on it. He 
      reaches the head of the table, and Absalom, who wears a black ceremonial

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There's actually a moment of 
      quiet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then Absalom SCREAMS, an inhuman shriek that 
      galvanizes the vampires (BOB, JANE and NED) into action. They effectively 
      flank our girl, and Jane and Ned rush her simultaneously.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She roundhouses them both in the jaw, 
      staggering them back as Bob gets her from behind but she elbows him in the 
      throat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They are trying to surround her -- full

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: ABSALOM</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Sees she's occupied. Roughly grabs Willow's

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ned peels off upstairs, leaving Buffy with 
      Jane and Bob.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She is on one side of a pile of boxes, Jane 
      behind her, Bob on the other side of the boxes. She kicks Jane, then 
      jumps, grabbing the top box and flipping herself over the pile, landing on 
      her feet -- and still holding the box, she brings it over her head and 
      SMASHES it over Bob's head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The guy's effectively wearing a box helmet. 
      Buffy powers out a side kick to the face, smashing through the box to it 
      hit. Bob flies back into the corner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jane slams into her and they both go 
      down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: XANDER AND ANGEL</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They're pulling the bodies to the safety of 
      the Balcony. Calendar and Cordy are lying nearby as they pull the third

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ned crests the stairs -- and Angel turns, 
      his VAMPIRE FACE now on. Ned charges -- Angel throws himself at him. They 
      grapple, stepping onto some rotted boards covering a hole. It breaks, the 
      two of them falling down to the lower level.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">is under Jane, struggling to keep him from 
      biting her. Her hand sweeps the floor, coming up with a box shard. She 
      slams it into her back, pushing her off right before she's 
      dusted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: BOB</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Gets the box off his head and climbs swiftly 
      to the ramp above Buffy's head, trying to escape.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy sees him. She runs, jumps -- grabs a 
      pipe under the ramp and swings her legs up --</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">--and THROUGH the wooden slats, tripping him 
      up, sending him flying to the ground. He lands hard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: ANGEL</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">as Ned shoves a shard of wood at his heart

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: XANDER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Gets Willow, the last one, off the chain. A

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JENNY<br/>I think so. My

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: BOB</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">flies into the corner under the balcony from

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: ABSALOM</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Steps out of the shadows by where the

      grind you <br/>into a sticky paste. And I'll hear you <br/>beg before I 
      smash in your face.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy stands by the big torch, listening. 
      Finally:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>So, are you gonna kill me? Or 
      are you <br/>just making small talk?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">That tears it. Absalom rushes her, swinging 
      back the hammer. At the same time, Bob does as well, from the opposite 
      direction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy stands by the torch, waiting. Doesn't 
      even look at them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">At the last second she SWEEPKICKS the base 
      of the torch, splintering it and flipping it up --</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">--the pointy end IMPALES Bob -- he's dusted 
      --<br/>--as the burning end IGNITES Absalom. He reels back, then comes at 
      her, arms aflame, swinging --<br/>--then stops as the flames literally 
      consume in (FX).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The sledgehammer drops to the ground in 
      front of Buffy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She takes a moment, breathing hard. Quiet in 
      victory. Looks at something, her expression changing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She picks up the sledgehammer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: THE OTHERS</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">watching from above, in various stages of

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she approaches the table, we TRACK BACK 
      to reveal it, the Master's bones laid out before her. She stares at it 
      quietly for a moment, then swings the sledgehammer and SMASHES the skull 
      in. She swings again, smashing the Master to powder, the grunts of her 
      efforts rising to a roar, still she swings it, again, again, out of 
      control--</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angel approaches, slowly. His face is human 
      once again. He touches her shoulder and she stops. Drops the hammer, 
      shaking. She starts crying just before he folds her into his 
      arms.</font></p>
<p>
