<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - WILLOW'S ROOM - 
      DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The soft light of morning filters through 
      the window, creating a warm glow. Willow and Tara are in bed under the 
      covers, glowing even warmer, slick with sweat and out of 
breath.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>When did morning 
      happen?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>After the moon went 
      down.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow laughs, kissing her soft and sensual. 
      Deep love territory.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Mmm. I forgot how 
      good this could<br/>feel. Us. Together.<br/>(a bit guiltily)<br/>Without the 
      magic.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(soft)<br/>There was 
      plenty of magic, Will.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow smiles, snuggling closer. Totally at 
      peace. Tara gently strokes her hair. Willow eyes the sunlight streaming 
      through the window.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It's getting 
      late.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>You want to get 
      up?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No. God, no. I was 
      just thinking<br/>about Buffy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(realizing)<br/>Oh. 
      She's still not back?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I didn't hear 
      her.<br/>(worried)<br/>She wouldn't talk about what happened<br/>at the magic 
      shop when she got home<br/>last night. She just wanted to know<br/>how close 
      I got to tracing the camera<br/>signal back to the Empire of the<br/>Nerds. 
      And then she left again.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I'm sure she'll be 
      okay.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'm not worried about 
      her going up<br/>against Warren and the others. I<br/>know this is going to 
      sound crazy,<br/>but... I think there might be<br/>something going on. With 
      Buffy and<br/>Spike.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Tara slides into uncomfortable. Willow 
      doesn't notice.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(cont'd)<br/>She 
      looked so hurt when she saw him<br/>with Anya. I think maybe --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(blurted)<br/>They've 
      been sleeping together.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(laughs)<br/>I don't 
      know if I'd go that far.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>No, I mean she told me 
      they've been<br/>sleeping together.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>They're sleeping 
      together? The naked<br/>kind of together?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I'm sorry I didn't say 
      anything. I<br/>promised her I wouldn't.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Does everyone else 
      know? Am I the<br/>only one she didn't --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>No, god. She didn't 
      even mean to<br/>tell me. It just came out.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>How could she hide 
      something like<br/>that from me?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I think she was afraid 
      of the look<br/>you'd get on your face. Kinda like<br/>the one you're 
      wearing now.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No, I'm not -- I'm 
      just trying to<br/>understand.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>So is she.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A beat as Willow absorbs this. Her bruised 
      feelings give way to concern for Buffy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>She probably really 
      needs someone to<br/>talk to.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Probably.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Tara gently kisses Willow's 
      forehead.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(cont'd)<br/>We were 
      kinda busy. Maybe we didn't<br/>hear her come home.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - 
      DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow, in a big oversized football shirt 
      for a nightie, knocks softly on Buffy's closed door.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Buffy?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">No reply. She creaks the door open, peeks 
      inside. Buffy's bed hasn't been slept in. She closes the door, heads back 
      to her room.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(O.S.)<br/>Is she back 
      yet?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow starts, turns. Dawn is coming out of 
      the bathroom in her pajamas.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Not yet. But I'm sure 
      she'll be back<br/>soon. Everything's fine. Go back to<br/>bed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(hello)<br/>It's ten 
      o'clock.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh, umm...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(worried)<br/>You don't 
      think she'd hurt Spike. Do<br/>you?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(surprised, 
      hurt)<br/>She told you about Spike?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>It was kinda obvious 
      last night.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(totally 
      not)<br/>Yeah, I totally knew.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>It must have hurt so 
      much. Seeing<br/>him and Anya like that. And poor<br/>Xander... Everything's 
      so screwed up.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It's gonna be all 
      right. It's<br/>just... complicated. When people<br/>have such strong 
      feelings for each<br/>other, sometimes they --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Tara comes out of the bedroom behind Willow, 
      wrapped in a blanket.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Is she back yet 
      --<br/>(spotting Dawn)<br/>Oh. Hey.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Tara wraps the blanket around herself more 
      tightly. Dawn is stunned.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>You -- you two -- Oh my 
      god!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn explodes in radiant delight.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(cont'd)<br/>Oh my god 
      oh my god oh my god!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Think that's my cue to 
      put some<br/>clothes on.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>No! I'm totally not 
      here. You guys<br/>do whatever you want. I'll watch TV.<br/>Really loud. In 
      the basement. Where<br/>I can't hear. Anything. Oh my god!<br/>Oh my 
      god!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She dashes off, beyond excited. Willow and 
      Tara share a blushing smile. Dawn dashes back up.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(cont'd)<br/>I love you 
      guys!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She dashes off again. Willow and Tara 
      beam.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. TRIO'S LAIR - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The door to the basement explodes as Buffy 
      kicks it clean off its hinges. She stands at the top of the stairs, a 
      study in power, ready to kick some serious ass.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(calling them 
      out)<br/>All right. Let's make this quick.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A beat. No response. Buffy's jaw tenses as 
      she descends the stairs, her pissed meter rising dangerously.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Fine. But I'm 
      not leaving till we<br/>have a little chat.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She spots a bunch of obscenely sexy 
      Vampirella-type action figures, frowns at them.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Very little, 
      considering the<br/>pummeling that needs to transpire.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She starts poking around, seeing what 
      they've been up to. She ends up by the evil-scheme white board which is 
      tilted at an angle on its pivots.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I mean, 
      hello. Slayer here, guys. Did<br/>you really think I wouldn't find 
      you</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She absently tilts the white board down. Two 
      words are written on it: TOO LATE. Buffy's brow furrows.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Well that 
      can't be good.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUZZZ! A huge buzz saw pops out of the wall, 
      slicing the white board in half. Buffy dives, barely avoiding the whirling 
      blade.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUZZ! BUZZ! BUZZ! Half a dozen more blades 
      appear, shredding everything in their path. Buffy dodges left and right, a 
      split hair away from being diced and sliced.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Two saw blades slice the air, one aimed at 
      her knees the other at her chest. Buffy dives between theme spinning in 
      mid-air. She lands on her feet and makes tracks for the door, grabbing 
      evidence as she goes.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">OMITTED</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">OMITTED</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. TRIO'S LAIR - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy dives out of the door with an armload 
      of books, papers, and data CDs -- anything she could grab. She hits the 
      ground hard.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy rises, freezes. A saw blade has 
      slashed the front of her jacket. She's untouched, but the jacket's a 
      goner. Her eyes narrow, extra pissed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay. Now that's gonna 
      cost you.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow and Tara hustle down the stairs, 
      tousled and flushed, adjusting their clothes.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>We're here! Ready for 
      action -- uh,<br/>bad guy fighting action.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy is by the coffee table, the evidence 
      she managed to save from the Trio's lair piled on it. Dawn is perched on 
      the coffee table, munching from a box of cereal.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh, guys, you didn't 
      have to -- I<br/>mean, if you want to be alone --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No, we're 
      good.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>We're better than 
      good.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Tara can't help giving Willow the shy, 
      sexy-thrilled smile. Willow returns it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Great.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(not 
      listening)<br/>Super...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She kisses Tara. It quickly segues into 
      grand passion. Buffy and Dawn are swept away in the joy of their rekindled 
      romance. They hug each other, then quickly become aware of how maudlin 
      they're being. They shift into a good natured mock-a-rama.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(to Buffy, 
      overblown)<br/>Oh I love you so much!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(overblown)<br/>I love 
      you more!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They shower each other with mock loud 
      kissage. Willow and Tara laugh.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay. We'll 
      stop.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>You better 
      not.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>We're just jealous. 
      True love.</font></p>

      Tara)<br/>How does that one work exactly?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(quick change)<br/>So, 
      em, nerds. How are them? They?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well. I found their 
      lair, but they<br/>must've know we were tracing their<br/>signal. They left 
      in hurry -- their<br/>van was gone, but everything else was<br/>still 
      there.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>We should go back. 
      Tara and I could<br/>Sherlock around and --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>There's nothing left. 
      Giant buzz<br/>saws. It was a thing.<br/>(re: evidence)<br/>This was all I 
      could save. I know<br/>it's not much, but we need to look<br/>for anything 
      that might tell us where<br/>they're going, what they're 
      planning.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Tara picks up a big arcane text bound by a 
      metal clasp. The bottom half breaks off, buzz-sawed at an angle. Loose 
      bits of parchment flutter.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Umm, this might take 
      awhile.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Anything we can do to 
      fast forward?<br/>We need to find Warren and the others<br/>before anyone 
      else gets hurt.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Should we call 
      Xander?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(uncomfortable)<br/>I 
      don't think he's in the Scooby<br/>space. Let's give him same 
      time.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(tentatively)<br/>Maybe 
      they've heard something in the<br/>demon bars about those guys. 
      Spike<br/>could help find out.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(snapping)<br/>Spike's 
      not --<br/>(calming)<br/>He's not a part of the group.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>So he's not going to be 
      around<br/>anymore?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't know, Dawn. 
      Not for a while.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn absorbs this with mixed 
      feelings.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>What about Anya? She 
      might be able<br/>to help with some of the demon texts.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm guessing she's not 
      feeling all<br/>researchy right now.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">PRE-LAP: A woman crying.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. RESTAURANT BAR - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A beautiful BLOND sits at the bar, her long 
      hair (identical to Anya's) hiding her face as she weeps into her drink. 
      WIDEN to reveal Anya sitting next to her. A hint of smoke indicates that 
      she just apperated in.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>I know how you feel. 
      Maybe I can help.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BLOND<br/>How could Carl do that 
      to me? That<br/>bastard!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>He's a man. Look no 
      further.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BLOND<br/>But with my sister? 
      She's not even<br/>pretty.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(guiltily)<br/>Well, 
      it's not always about looks.<br/>Or a beating heart. Sometimes<br/>intimate 
      sweaty relations with the<br/>wrong person just seems like a good<br/>idea 
      at the time.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BLOND<br/>She's fat! He cheated 
      on me with my<br/>fat ugly sister!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Likes 'em fleshy, huh? 
      Bet you wish<br/>he'd bloat up a couple thousand<br/>pounds and pop like a 
      big ol' meat<br/>zeppelin, don't ya?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BLOND<br/>(sobbing)<br/>He said 
      he loved me!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(sarcastic)<br/>Oh, gee, 
      then I guess he must have<br/>meant it, 'cause hey -- guys never<br/>say 
      anything they don't really mean,<br/>do they?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BLOND<br/>But we --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>They say, "I love you," 
      and you think<br/>it's true.<br/>(more)</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA (cont'd)<br/>They say, "Oh, 
      Anya, I want to be<br/>with you for the rest of my life,"<br/>and you 
      believe them, you believe<br/>they feel the same way you do 
      because<br/>that's the way love's supposed to<br/>work, right?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BLOND<br/>Who's Anya?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Then you get all 
      excited with the tingly<br/>anticipation, but wait! Not so fast!<br/>There's 
      the apocalypse and the back from<br/>the grave and the blah blah blah and 
      by<br/>the time you're finally standing in that<br/>beautifully expensive 
      white dress you've<br/>dreamed of wearing ever since you became<br/>human, 
      he's gone all heebie-jeebie and<br/>decides he'd rather just go 
      steady.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BLOND<br/>(a beat)<br/>Men 
      suck.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The blond's face darkens into revenge mode. 
      Here it comes.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BLOND (cont'd)<br/>I wish Carl's 
      flesh were being gnawed<br/>off by a thousand angry --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>He keeps saying it's 
      not me, but how<br/>can I believe him? He knew he didn't<br/>want to get 
      married. Deep down he<br/>knew, but he lied to me every day 
      for<br/>months.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BLOND<br/>I wish --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>He lied and lied and 
      then lied a<br/>little more, 'cause hey - who's gonna<br/>notice with all

      just sweep the carnage<br/>under the rug by saying --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A series of underground tunnels carved out 
      of solid rock. Andrew is on the ground, scuttling backward, 
      terrified.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>I'm sorry!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A NEZZLA DEMON looms over him. The demon is 
      a huge rippling mass of tattooed muscle. Skeletal protrusions crisscross 
      his body and face, forming a tough organic armor. It's big, mean, and 
      currently pissed off.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>Please! I'll 
      never try to desecrate<br/>your chamber again! Just don't hurt<br/>me! 
      Please!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew backs into the wall. The demon 
      growls, his shadow enveloping him as he raises his claws for the death 
      blow.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ZAPP! The demon suddenly arcs with crackling 
      energy. He howls, whirls around. Warren and Jonathan are behind him. 
      Warren jabs the demon with a long, vicious cattle prod type of device. The 
      demon arcs up, but keeps coming.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Hit him again! Hit 
      him again!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren jabs the demon repeatedly. ZAPP! 
      ZAPP! The demon staggers, finally goes down, smoking slightly.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>These things are a 
      lot tougher than<br/>I thought. One jolt from this should<br/>have dropped 
      an elephant --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew grabs the prod from Warren and 
      repeatedly shocks the prone demon.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>(pissed)<br/>You want 
      a piece of this? Huh? Oh,<br/>not so tough now, are you. Puff 
      'N<br/>Stuff?!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Hey. Hey! We need him 
      fresh. Not<br/>smoke house.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>I'm done being the 
      bait. Next time<br/>one of you can wiggle on the hook.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren squats down next to the 
      demon.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>If this works, next 
      time <u>we'll</u> be the<br/>thing everyone's afraid of.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan eyes the demon's body 
      uncertainly.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Okay, so... What 
      now?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren clicks open a big knife.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Now it's your turn? 
      Sparky.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He tosses the knife to Jonathan. Jonathan 
      eyes it with mounting dread.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. SPIKE'S CRYPT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike pours a liberal amount of vodka into a

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN (O.S.)<br/>Does it 
      help?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike glances over, Dawn is in the doorway,

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike slips into his chair by the TV, 
      sipping his drink.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I just wanted to stop 
      by on my way<br/>and, you know...<br/>(a beat)<br/>Everybody's pretty mad at 
      you.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Yeah. Kinda picked up 
      on that.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(soft, 
      disappointed)<br/>You're not going to be coming around<br/>anymore. Are 
      you?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike tries to formulate an 
      answer.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>It's... complicated, 
      nibblet.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Everybody keeps saying 
      that.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Must be true 
      then.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He drinks, dulling the pain.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Was it worth it? What 
      you did with<br/>Anya?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(ouch)<br/>Buffy told 
      you?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Kinda caught the show. 
      There was a<br/>camera somewhere in the magic shop.<br/>Warren and Jonathan 
      and that other<br/>guy have been watching Buffy.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(a beat)<br/>No. It was 
      just... a bad day. For<br/>both of us. We had a few drinks and<br/>things 
      just --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Not Anya. Buffy. Do you 
      really love her?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike doesn't reply, but the answer is 
      obvious.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Then how could 
      you do that to her?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(bristling)<br/>Oh, 
      right. Big Sis was treating me so<br/>well up until then. Huh. Must still

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike chews on that, deep regret creeping 
      into his eyes. Dawn quietly slips out, closing the door behind her. Spike 
      sits motionless in his chair, draped in shadows, small and 
      alone.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE on a large chamber carved into the 
      wall at the end of the tunnel. The entrance is protected by a mystical 
      barrier that ripples like water.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A Nezzla demon exits the chamber. The 
      barrier stretches around it, snapping back into place as it passes. The 
      demon moves off down a side passage. Warren and Andrew appear from the 
      shadows. They speak in hushed, excited whispers.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>This is it. We found 
      it.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew steps closer to the barrier, trying 
      to peer inside the chamber.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>You sure it's in 
      there?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Careful! Only Nezzla 
      demons can pass<br/>through the barrier.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He tosses a rock at the barrier. It 
      vaporizes on contact.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN (cont'd)<br/>Everything 
      else gets curly fried.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN (O.S.)<br/>Um... maybe 
      we oughta rethink this.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They turn. Jonathan is standing behind them. 
      He's wearing the hastily stitched together skin on the Nezzla demon they 
      electrocuted earlier. It hangs off him in loose sheets, way too big. The 
      head skin dangles in back like a hood.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Just make sure all 
      your skin's<br/>covered.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Why can't I just 
      use a glamor?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>You can't Siegfried 
      and Roy the<br/>barrier. It's gotta be the real deal.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He pulls the skin hood over Jonathan's 
      face.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(muffled)<br/>Ouhh! 
      It's still wet!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Good. Then it should 
      still be fresh<br/>enough.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(muffled)<br/>Should 
      be?! Wait a minute, what do<br/>you mean, should be --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren shoves Jonathan into the 
      barrier.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN 
      (cont'd)<br/>(muffled)<br/>Ahhhh!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Demon-skinned Jonathan passes through the 
      barrier. It crackles more that it did for the real demons, but he makes it 
      through, crashing to the ground on the other side.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>(pleasantly 
      surprised)<br/>Huh. Wasn't sure that was gonna work.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Through the rippling barrier we see Jonathan 
      get up and dust himself off.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(muffled)<br/>Jackass.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He disappears into the interior of the 
      chamber.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>You think he 
      knows?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>If he did, he 
      wouldn't be here.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Why is he? Our mojo's 
      tight, bro.<br/>We could've pulled this ourselves.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>(re: 
      barrier)<br/>Somebody had to guinea pig the meat<br/>suit. Were you going to 
      Volunteer?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew frowns -- no way. He eyes the 
      chamber, searching for any sign of Jonathan.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>I don't trust that 
      leprechaun.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Just stay frosty. 
      This works the way<br/>we planned it, by the end of the<br/>night Jonathan 
      won't be a problem.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The barrier ripples. Jonathan 
      reappears.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN (cont'd)<br/>Did you get 
      it?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(muffled)<br/>Yeah, 
      I got it.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He holds up a small rectangular wooden box 
      carved with the same symbols tattooed on the demons. No hinges, no 
      latches, no opening of any kind. Warren hungrily snatches it 
up.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>(dubious)<br/>That's 
      it?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(muffled)<br/>It'd 
      better be.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He pulls the skin hood off his head. His 
      face is streaked with demon goo. It's in his hair, too, making it stand at 
      odd-angled attention.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>No way I'm 
      not going back through<br/>there. That thing stings like a 
      mother.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew boings Jonathan's spiked 
      hair.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Dude, unholy hair 
      gel.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Get off.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Make me, skin 
      job.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Shut up.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren presses a small electronic gizmo the 
      size of a stick of gum onto the front of the demon box, activates a series 
      of buttons on it. It crackles, a line of energy flashing around the box, 
      creating a lid.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren pulls the top of the box off. Nestled 
      inside are two handball-sized crystal orbs lightly etched with the same 
      symbols tattooing the Nezzla demons. Suspended in the center of each orb 
      is a small, spiky blood-red sphere.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN (cont'd)<br/>Gentlemen. 
      The Orbs of Nezzla'khan.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren gingerly removes them from the

      Invulnerability. The<br/>deluxe package.</font></p>

      work --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren tightens his fist around each globe. 
      A red blast of energy explodes around him, knocking Andrew and Jonathan 
      back. It quickly dissipates, his eyes briefly flashing with red energy. He 
      grins, raw power coursing through his veins.</font></p>

      pouch attached to the side of his belt. The pouch is double-spherically 
      contoured so the orbs fit perfectly. Jonathan eyes Warren 
      cautiously.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>You don't look any

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>I thought they were 
      supposed to make<br/>us all huge and veiny. Are you sure<br/>they're working

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Let's find 
      out.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A roar splits the air as a Nezzla demon 
      charges up. Jonathan and Andrew shrink back, but Warren stands his ground. 
      WHAM! The demon tears into him.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren exchanges bone-shattering blows, the 
      grin never leaving his face. He blocks a punch, spins the demon around and 
      SNAP! He brutally breaks its neck. The demon's body hits the ground right 
      at Jonathan's feet.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(awed and

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan reaches for Warren's orb pouch.

      grip.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Watch the paws, 
      little man.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Xander, you fought

      haven't made<br/>mistakes. But the last time I<br/>checked slaughtering half 
      of Europe<br/>wasn't one of them. He doesn't have<br/>a soul, Buffy. Just a 
      leash they<br/>jammed in his head. You think he'd<br/>still be all snuggles 
      if that chip<br/>ever stopped working?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy starts to reply.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Would you 
      still trust him with Dawn<br/>then?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Silence. The answer is obvious.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(a beat, soft)<br/>It 
      doesn't matter. I'm not seeing<br/>him anymore. It's over.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(bitterly)<br/>Yeah. 
      Lot of that going around.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He crushes the beer can in his hand, tosses 
      it on the coffee table as he heads for the door. Buffy watches him go,

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Why?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Because I care about

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>It wasn't for you. I

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You know

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Because you love

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A beat. This has gone way beyond pain and

      honestly)<br/>No. I don't.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Why do you keep

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm not saying I don't 
      have feelings<br/>for you. I do. But it's not love.<br/>I could never trust 
      you enough for it<br/>to become that.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Trust is for old

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She stumbles back. She grabs onto the shower

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike is on her, pinning her against the

      Frank strains with all his might, but Warren doesn't move an inch. Warren 
      smiles coolly.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>This ain't high 
      school.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">WHAM! Warren hits him with an open palm to 
      the chest. Frank goes flying across the room. He lands in a heap and stays 
      there.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Frank's meathead pals attack. Meathead #1 
      launches a punch at Warren's jaw. Warren blocks the blow -- and snaps the 
      meathead's arm like a dried twig. Meathead #1 howls in pain, dropping to 
      his knees.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">WHACK! Meathead #2 slams a chair across 
      Warren's back. The chair splinters apart: WHAM! Warren backhands him, 
      sending the Meathead sailing into the bottles lining the back of the 
      bar.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The music has stopped. Andrew beams. 
      Jonathan is horrified. The silent crowd stares at Warren in fear. He 
      adjusts his tie, gives them a winning grin.</font></p>

      party.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON RESTROOM as Xander exits, well 
      lubricated. He pauses as he registers what's happening. Great. The end to 
      a perfect night.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ON WARREN</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">walking up to the front of the bar where a 
      handful of beautiful women are seated.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Don't worry about the 
      tab, ladies.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He slams his fist down across the back of 
      the cash register, smashing it open.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN (cont'd)<br/>It's on 
      daddy tonight.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He rips the drawer out, starts removing the 
      cash. One of the women starts crying, totally terrified.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN (cont'd)<br/>Aww, don't 
      cry, baby.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He moves in close, using the stack of cash 
      in his hand to sensually trace along the woman's bare arm.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN(cont'd)<br/>Daddy's gonna 
      give you some too...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(walking up)<br/>See 
      now, I think it's the daddy thing<br/>that's throwing her. 'cause incest 
      --<br/>not that sexy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(softly, 
      watching)<br/>Aw crap.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>So why don't we leave 
      the ladies to<br/>their impending nausea and move the<br/>freakshow outside. 
      Wadaya say?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A beat. Warren gives Xander a bright 
      grin.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Okay. But can I ask 
      you something<br/>first? You think maybe you could put<br/>a word in for me 
      with that Anya<br/>chick? 'Cause if she's taking it<br/>from a vamp, I think 
      I might have a<br/>chance --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">POW! Xander slugs him in the face. Warren 
      doesn't even twitch. Xander grips his hand in pain. Warren 
      laughs.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN(cont'd)<br/>No wonder 
      she's screwing a dead guy.<br/>You hit like a girl.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(through the 
      pain)<br/>At least I know how to get one.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren's face darkens. WHAM! He slugs 
      Xander, sending him flying. Xander crashes across a table and smashes to 
      the floor, bleeding and barely conscious. Warren advances, pushing the 
      pool table casually out of his way as he goes, murder in his 
      eyes.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Let's see how popular 
      you are without<br/>a face...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan rushes up next to him, grabbing his 
      arm.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Warren, we have to 
      go.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren stares coldly at the offending hand 
      on his arm. Jonathan prudently releases him.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>We go when I'm 
      ready.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Hey, your 
      call.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan indicates his watch.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN(cont'd)<br/>But we're 
      gonna miss that thing you<br/>wanted to do tonight if we don't<br/>leave 
      right now. That's all I'm<br/>saying.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren considers his options. He smiles at 
      Xander still on the floor.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>It's your lucky 
      night. Shemp.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren turns away, heading for the door. 
      Jonathan tries to hide how relieved he is. Andrew is shocked.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>We're just gonna 
      leave him?! What if<br/>he sics the Slayer on us?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren shrugs as they hit the 
      exit.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Bring her 
      on.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The front door is hanging open. Xander 
      hustles in, his face bruised and lip bleeding.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Buffy? I found 
      Warren.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He glances into the living room and the 
      dining room. Empty.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Actually, my 
      face kinda found him --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He freezes. Spike's leather coat is draped 
      across the banister at the foot of the stairs. Xander's face

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>This what you call 
      not seeing Spike<br/>anymore --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander freezes, really seeing Buffy now. The 
      torn robe. Her eyes red from tears.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER 
      (cont'd)<br/>(soft)<br/>What did he do?<br/>(rising anger)<br/>Did he hurt 
      you? Buffy?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>He tried. He 
      didn't...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She notices a bruise on her thigh, 
      self-consciously covers it with her robe. Xander boils over.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Son of a 
      bitch.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He heads for the door, intent on evening the

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(soft)<br/>Don't.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander pauses, shaking with 
anger.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY 
      (cont'd)<br/>(soft)<br/>Please, just... don't.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander stands there, paralyzed, his fury 
      giving way to concern for his friend. The downstairs door bangs shut. 
      Buffy starts, extremely skittish.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander tenses as feet pound up the stairs. 
      Willow appears in the doorway, flush with researchy excitement.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hey, I think we 
      finally got<br/>something --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She sees Xander's battered face, Buffy's 
      condition.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW 
      (cont'd)<br/>(concerned)<br/>What happened?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Nothing.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy wipes at her eyes, turns to Willow, 
      shifting into hero mode.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>What did you 
      find out?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The table is piled with the evidence Buffy 
      snagged from the Trio's lair. Xander has an ice pack pressed to his 
      bruised face. Buffy's dressed now and ready for action.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>We were able to 
      decipher pretty much<br/>everything except these.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She hands Buffy half dozen sheets of a 
      parchment inscribed with strange markings.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>It's not written in any

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(chuckling)<br/>It's 
      Klingon. They're love poems --<br/>(geek alert)<br/>-- which have nothing to 
      do with the<br/>insidious scheme you're about to<br/>describe.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What do you got that 
      doesn't rhyme?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>This.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She holds up one of the data CDs.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It was filled with

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Banks, armored car 
      routes, corporate<br/>vaults... This is big.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>They're looking to 
      score some serious<br/>dinero. I don't think they're<br/>planning just one

      anyone?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(eyeing

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You don't have to. 
      There's one here<br/>we think they'll hit tonight.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>It's time 
      sensitive.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow hands Buffy the printout.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Be careful. Warren's 
      gone all Mighty<br/>Mouse. Emphasis on the might.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander tenderly feels his jaw. Buffy's face 
      darkens. Just what the anger ordered.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Good. I won't have to 
      hold back.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. SPIKE'S CRYPT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The door to Spike's crypt crashes open. 
      Spike bursts in (sans leather coat). Anger, humiliation, and regret swirl 
      across his tormented face.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S BATHROOM - <b>FLASHBACK

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(sarcastic)<br/>Yeah. I'm sure he'll be giving 
      'em<br/>up any second.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ON WARREN</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">as he rips the thick steel door off the back 
      of the armored car and tosses it aside.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (O.S.)<br/>Is this your 
      bank?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren jerks his head up. Buffy is standing 
      above him on top of the overturned car.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>'Cause if not, there's 
      gonna be a fee<br/>for that.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">WHAM! She drops down on Warren. He catches 
      her in mid fall and flings her. She lands hard twenty feet away, Warren 
      casually strolls towards her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>I was wondering when 
      Super Bitch<br/>would show up.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy struggles to her feet.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You really got a 
      problem with strong<br/>women, don't you?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Nothing I can't 
      handle.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">WHAM! He lays into her. They exchange blows, 
      going to toe to toe. No matter how hard she hits him, Warren keeps coming. 
      BAM! Warren lands a couple of hard blows. Buffy staggers back, still 
      feeling the effects of her run in with the vamp -- and Spike.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN (cont'd)<br/>Seem a 
      little off. Bad day?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's getting 
      better.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">WHAM! She lays into him with a flurry of 
      lightening fast blows. He's strong, but not nearly as fast as she 
      is.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren swings wildly, misses. She flips over 
      him, grabs the big steel door he ripped off the armored car and BOOM! She 
      parks him in the cheap seats.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren sails back, crashing into the base of 
      the archway. He shakes the blow off, laughs.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>That all you 
      got?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">STONE CRACKS above him. He whips his head up 
      just in time to see a huge section of the upper arch break loose from the 
      impact. WHAM! He disappears under the rubble.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>(guts ripped 
      out)<br/>No!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy whips her head around, spots Jonathan 
      and Andrew. Uh oh -- the gig's up. She starts towards them, her eyes 
      flashing with anger.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>There's two ways this 
      can end. And<br/>right about now I'm thinking they're<br/>both gonna 
      hurt.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A strange, excited smile splits Andrew's 
      lips.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>I think you're 
      right.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A RUMBLING splits the air behind Buffy. She 
      turns -- and sees Warren rising from beneath the rubble. Her face drops. 
      His clothes are a little worse for wear, but he's unscathed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>What's the matter 
      baby? Never fight<br/>a real man before.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He grins, ready for round two.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">WHAM! Warren attacks, raining blows down. 
      Buffy counters, spins, and catches him with a devastating kick to the 
      back. Warren sails into the side of the armored car, denting the steel and 
      landing in a heap.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy catches her breath. That oughta -- she 
      sags. Warren's getting up again. He cracks his neck and laughs, enjoying 
      himself.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Wow. That almost 
      hurt, kitten.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy grits her teeth, attacks. They trade 
      blows, but he's wearing her down. She's quickly forced to go on the 
      defensive.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ON ANDREW AND JONATHAN</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew's face is twisted in gleeful 
      bloodlust. He's really getting off on this.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>(egging Warren 
      on)<br/>Kill her! Kill her!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan is horrified. This has gotten way 
      out of hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ON WARREN AND BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy is so exhausted she can barely defend 
      herself. Warren savors the moment, landing blows at will, toying with 
      her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>You know who I 
      am?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You're a 
      murderer.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>(laughs)<br/>That too. 
      But more to the point --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She tries to hit him, he blocks, smacks her 
      hard across the face with an open hand.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN (cont'd)<br/>I'm the guy 
      that beat you. And it's<br/>not the muscles, baby.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He blocks her again, smacks her across the 
      other side of her face.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN(cont'd)<br/>It's the 
      brains.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">WHAM! He cracks her hard, sending her 
      reeling back. She glares, bloody and winded but far from giving 
      up.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'll remember that 
      when I knock 'em<br/>clean out of your --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">WHAM! Jonathan suddenly leaps onto Buffy's 
      back, screaming like a madman. Warren pauses, laughing at the 
      spectacle.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Whoa, Sparky! Didn't 
      think you had<br/>it in you.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(hissing in her 
      ear)<br/>The orbs! Smash his orbs --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy throws him off. Jonathan lands hard, 
      groans in pain. Buffy locks eyes him, registering what he just said -- 
      with but just a moment too late. Warren is already on her, beating the 
      hell out of her.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy manages to block several blows, then 
      delivers a stunning kick to Warren's crotch -- which has no effect. 
      Jonathan grimaces.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN(cont'd)<br/>(soft, to 
      himself)<br/>Not those orbs!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren attacks, the kick to the jewels 
      infuriating him. Buffy tries to fight back but there's not much left in 
      her. Warren lands a blow to her stomach, sending her gasping to her knees. 
      He looms over her.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He rears his fist back for the deathblow. As 
      he does, his jacket pulls back, revealing the leather pouch containing the 
      Orbs of Nezzla'khan.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Say good night, 
      bitch.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy spots the pouch just in time. She rips 
      it off his belt and smashes it to the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The red energy he absorbed from the orbs is 
      ripped out of him. He grunts in pain as his eyes flash red for an instant 
      -- then it's gone. Buffy stands, powerful, victorious.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Good night, 
      bitch.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">POW! She spins around and kicks him in the 
      chests sending him flying back. He lands hard, bloodied and 
      bruised.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy advances slowly, her contempt for 
      Warren blazing. He struggles to his feet, trying to bite back the tears of 
      pain and humiliation.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You're 
      nothing but a sad little boy,<br/>Warren. But it's time to grow up 
      --<br/>and pay for what you've done.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>Get away from 
      me!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He desperately strips off his jacket, 
      revealing a harness underneath. He's breathing heavy, furious and 
      unhinged. Sleek little twin rockets click into place on a back plate -- 
      yes, kids, it's a jet pack.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN (cont'd)<br/>I swear to 
      god I'm gonna take you<br/>down. You piece of..</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Warren hits a thumb ignition switch and 
      rockets off into the sky on a pillar of jet exhaust. Buffy cranes her 
      neck, watching in disbelief.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh come on.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Well played, 
      Slayer!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew rips off his bomber jacket, also 
      revealing a jet pack. Jonathan is apoplectic.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Why didn't I get 
      one of those?!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>This round to you. 
      But the game is<br/>far from over.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He hits the ignition. WHOOSH! He shoots up 
      into the air -- and slams into an overhanging roof structure five feet 
      above him. He crashes back to earth, unconscious, his rockets sputtering 
      out.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">PRE-LAP: A police siren.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT./INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A police cruiser whizzes past, siren 
      blaring. Andrew and Jonathan are being led into the station in handcuffs. 
      Jonathan is swimming in a bottomless pit of despair. Andrew's banged up 
      from his jet pack fiasco -- and crying his eyes out.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Jet packs. You 
      jerks were setting me<br/>up to take the fall.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>(sobbing)<br/>He left 
      me. He flew away and left me.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The police officers lead Warren and Jonathan 
      into the station. Jonathan eyes his surroundings with dread.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Oh god. The Big

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">AUDREW<br/>(sobbing)<br/>How 
      could he do that to me? He<br/>promised we'd be together. He was<br/>just 
      using me. He never really<br/>loved --<br/>(catching himself)<br/>-- hanging 
      out with us.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan eyes him. How's that 
      again?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE ROAD - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike roars up on his bike, loaded with his 
      gear. He pauses, taking in the lights of Sunnydale off in the distance. He 
      takes a drag off his cigarette, flicks it to the asphalt.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Get nice and comfy 
      Slayer. I'll be<br/>back. And when I do... it's all<br/>gonna 
      change.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He pops the clutch and rockets 
      off.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - WILLOW'S ROOM - 
      DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Sunlight streams in. Willow and Tara are 
      getting dressed. Willow pulls on a white shirt.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hey. 
      Clothes.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Don't get too used to

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yes,

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow pulls her into a kiss. Soft, tender,

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Mmmm... 
      Xander.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay, not quite the

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>No, he's 
      here.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Tara goes to the window overlooking the 
      backyard. Xander is walking up to Buffy down below.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Think they're making 
      up?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I hope so.</font></p>

      won't.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">An awkward silence. Xander struggles to find 
      the right words, can't.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>How did we get 
      here?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Scenic route. Long

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>These last few

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I thought I hit 
      bottom, but... It<br/>hurt. That you didn't trust me<br/>enough to tell me 
      about Spike. It<br/>hurt.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm sorry. I should 
      have told you.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Maybe you would have. 
      If I hadn't<br/>given you so many reasons to think<br/>I'd be an ass about 
      it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Guess we've both done

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Think I got you

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Wanna

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Not so 
      much.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They share a smile. It fades quickly from 
      Xander's face.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>I don't know 
      what I'd do... without<br/>you and Will.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Let's not find 
      out.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She takes him in her arms. He hugs her 
      close, tears of relief breaking loose as he finally lets go of his anger 
      and pain. A long beat.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I love you. 
      You know that. right?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander's about to reply -- but his eyes go 
      wide with horror.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Buffy --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy turns. Warren is standing in the very

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WARREN<br/>You think you can 
      just do that to me?<br/>That I'd let you get away with it?<br/>Think again 
      --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Before she can react he raises a black 
      automatic handgun and opens fire, the violence of bullets exploding from 
      the muzzle startling even him.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy shoves Xander to the ground. He lands 
      hard, regaining his senses just in time to see Warren running out of the 
      yard, firing his last shoots as he goes. Xander swallows his heart back 
      into his chest.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Sweet fancy Moses! 
      Where the hell<br/>did he get --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander's face freezes in horror. Buffy is on

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He presses his hands against her chest, 
      trying to stop the blood. It flows through his fingers, pooling beneath 
      them, spreading across the grass. It's ugly -- and real.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy's breath comes in ragged gasps. She 
      stares blankly up at the clear blue sky, her skin pale, going into
