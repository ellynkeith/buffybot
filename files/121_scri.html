<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">(JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR: This picks up just 
      moments after episode 20 ends - so in the "Previously" we have just seen: 
      1. Willow kill Warren in full horror show style, 2. Buffy, Xander and 
      Anya's reacting to the murder, 3. Willow's line "one down," followed by 
      her magical disappearance into the night sky).</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">WHICH BRINGS US TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy leads Xander and Anya out of the 
      woods. Moving with uninterrupted urgency, they pass through the trees, 
      heading their way out of the woods, away frown the murder 
      scene...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Come on. We have to 
      keep moving.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I think I'm gonna be 
      sick.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Again?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander stops, steadying himself against a 
      tree, fighting against getting light-headed. Buffy stops, heads back to 
      him, speaks gently if urgently:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Xander, we don't have 
      time.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I know, it's just - 
      what happened<br/>back there, the sounds of it. The<br/>smell ...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(shaken)<br/>Willow 
      did that.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's why we have to 
      move.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy places a hand on Xander's shoulder, 
      but it's her eye contact which steadies him. He nods. The move on. They 
      talk as they move - faster, now.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You heard 
      what she said. "One<br/>down."</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>So we're thinking 'two 
      to go'.<br/>Jonathan. And, whatsisface, the<br/>other guy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Andrew. Both of them 
      are just<br/>sitting in the county jail without<br/>a clue Willow's 
      coming.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You don't think she's 
      gonna kill<br/>them too? She wouldn't.<br/>(unsure)<br/>There's no good 
      reason.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Will's got an 
      addictive<br/>personality, and she's just tasted<br/>blood.<br/>(beat)<br/>She 
      could be there already.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>No she couldn't. A 
      witch at her<br/>level? She could only go<br/>airborne. It's a thing. 
      Very<br/>flashy, impresses the locals, but<br/>it does take 
      longer.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Longer than 
      what?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Teleporting.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And with that, Anya TELEPORTS out of sight 
      in a swirl of mystical energies. Leaving Xander and Buffy 
      behind.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Right, Vengeance 
      Demon. How could<br/>I... at least she'll get there<br/>first.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And I'm counting the 
      ways that<br/>could go wrong.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Anya can handle 
      herself.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Against Willow - 
      tonight - don't<br/>be too sure.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>She's got to come 
      down sometime,<br/>doesn't she? I mean back there<br/>she was out of her 
      head - running<br/>on grief and Magicks.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Doesn't matter - 
      Willow just<br/>killed somebody. Killing changes<br/>you. Believe me: I 
      know.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Warren was a stone 
      cold killer of<br/>women just getting warmed up. You<br/>ask me? Bastard had 
      it coming.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Maybe. Jonathan and 
      Andrew don't.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander gets quiet, thinks a beat, 
      then:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>This is still Willow 
      we're dealing<br/>with, right?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I hope so. I mean, I 
      want to<br/>believe that as much as you do,<br/>but whatever she's going 
      through,<br/>we gotta stop her. And maybe we<br/>can if we get to 
      your...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They reach the clearing. And come upon 
      Xander's CAR, parked on the edge of the woods. They all stop short. P.O.V. 
      shot of the car reveals: it's a WRECK. Hood up, steam pouring out, tires 
      flat, windows spiderwebbed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>... 
      car.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Willow...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Looks like she wants 
      to finish the<br/>job without us tagging along.<br/>Meet me at the 
      jail.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Sure, but how are you 
      gonna...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And without wasting another word, Buffy 
      takes off RUNNING. We see her from Xander's P.O.V. She moves like an 
      animal, hitting close to forty miles an hour, and leaping over a felled 
      tree (thanks to an air-ram) without breaking stride. She is 
      gone.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander stands behind, alone, looking 
      helpless.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Okay, then, 
      I'll just... catch<br/>up. She's only my best friend,<br/>you know. No big 
      deal, just...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And Xander just trails off, not even trying 
      for the self-deprecating funny anymore. He glares at the long road ahead 
      of him. And suddenly PUNCHES the car in frustration. It hurts. He 
      grimaces, rubs his hand.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER 
      (cont'd)<br/>(grim)<br/>...Glad I can help.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Establishing. The Sunnydale Police Station. 
      It's a pretty peaceful night. The occasional PATROL CAR cruises by 
      ...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Inside, slowly, lazily tracking our way 
      through the station. Papers get filed, reports signed. Nothing doing, 
      basically.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. JAIL CELL HALLWAY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And still we head down the CELL HALLWAY. 
      INMATES doze or read magazines. We pass down the hall until we come 
      upon:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">... The cell of JONATHAN and ANDREW. 
      Jonathan stands wearily propped up against the cell bars, looking out 
      forlornly into the depressing hallway. Behind him we see Andrew, 
      animatedly distracted, examining parts of his own body (hair, teeth, 
      fingernails) methodically. He stops, as if listening.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Dude. Move like, a 
      foot to your<br/>left.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(immobile)<br/>What 
      for?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>I'm trying to hear 
      something.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Like 
      what?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew looks around to make sure no one's 
      listening, then harshly whispers:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Signals -</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Beat.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Oh for crying out 
      loud. Signals?<br/>Who from, your probe-happy alien<br/>friends? Say - maybe 
      we can trade<br/>in some cigarettes for tin foil -<br/>make you a nice 
      antenna hat...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Laugh it up, 
      Fuzzball. I figured<br/>it out. Warren never abandoned<br/>us. Well, not me, 
      anyway.<br/>(checking body)<br/>This is like his test. If we can<br/>just 
      figure out how he's<br/>communicating with us, we'll be,<br/>you know, 
      worthy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>You're checking for 
      <i>implants</i>?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>(defensive)<br/>Lex 
      Luthor had a false epidermis<br/>escape kit in Superman versus 
      the<br/>Amazing Spider-Man Treasury<br/>edition ...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Okay, first of all, 
      those were<br/>sonic disrupters and second of all<br/>...you are sadness 
      personified.<br/>Waiting for Warren? Yeah, maybe<br/>he'll bust us out of 
      here on<br/>Santa's magic sleigh.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew stops checking himself, 
      offended.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>I'm telling him you 
      said that.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Why wait - I'll 
      tell him myself.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan jerks Andrew's elbow toward him 
      like a microphone and speaks into it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>Come in, 
      Warren, do you read me,<br/>your girlfriend's pathetic, over.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew jerks his arm away, pissed. This 
      could get violent.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Shut up, Jerk-athan! 
      See this?<br/>This is why we get the jet packs<br/>and all you get is left 
      behind.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>So you admit 
      it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Why not? You were out 
      of the Trio<br/>a long time ago in a galaxy far,<br/>far away and you know 
      why, little<br/>feller?<br/>(intense)<br/>No respect for the chain 
      of<br/>command.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Yeah, look how far 
      it got you.<br/>Checking every hole in your sad<br/>little body for 
      transmitters that<br/>don't exist.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Oh I'll find it if I 
      have to check<br/>every hole in my body and yours.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Andrew grabs Jonathan.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Get off!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Make me!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan shoves him back. They glare at one 
      another, across the cell, about to attack - they LUNGE at one another, but 
      both get blown back up against the cell walls as Anya teleports into the 
      center of the cell.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Smoke dissipates. The boys stare, 
      aghast.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>(to 
      Jonathan)<br/>You do that?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan shakes his head.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>There you two are. 
      Listen to me.<br/>We have to get you out of here now<br/>or you'll both be 
      killed.<br/>(calling out)<br/>Guard!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>What's going 
      on?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Guard!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Stop that!<br/>(to 
      Jonathan)<br/>I don't trust her. Do you trust<br/>her? This is major 
      uncool...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Anya, you gotta 
      break this down<br/>for us a little, or...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Anya whirls on the two of them, angry. Talks 
      fast:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Warren shot Buffy. 
      Warren shot<br/>Tara. Buffy's alive. Tara's<br/>dead. Willow found out and 
      being<br/>the most powerful Wicca in the<br/>western hemisphere, she went 
      for<br/>the payback. With interest.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Wh-what about 
      Warren?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>She killed him. Ripped 
      him apart<br/>and bloodied up the forest doing<br/>it. Now she's coming here 
      and you<br/>two are next.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Oh my 
      God...<br/>(lost)<br/>Warren.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He reaches out to steady himself, manages to 
      sit.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(realizing)<br/>Oh 
      my God - me. GUARD!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>(small)<br/>But we 
      didn't do anything...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>GUARD!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A grumpy-looking POLICE OFFICER approaches 
      the cell, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">OFFICER<br/>All right, all 
      right, what do you...<br/>(seeing Anya)<br/>Who the hell are you?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Something's coming. 
      Something<br/>bad. You have to let these men<br/>out or I guarantee you 
      there will<br/>be hell to pay.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The Officer takes his time looking things 
      over.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">OFFICER<br/>Okay, and, uh...what 
      exactly's<br/>coming?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>One of the many things 
      in this<br/>world you are not prepared to deal<br/>with.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">OFFICER<br/>(amused)<br/>That a 
      fact?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Yes. And we're out of 
      time. Just<br/>believe me when I tell you...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She TELEPORTS out of the cell - disappearing 
      before the Officer's very eyes. And before he can really adjust to the 
      reality of it - she RE-APPEARS - standing outside the cell, right next to 
      him.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA (cont'd)<br/>...These 
      things are real.<br/>They're dangerous. And they're<br/>coming.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And off Anya, we cut to:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Outside the Police Station, a PATROL COP 
      sits in his parked SQUAD CAR, finishing up a nightly report while lazily 
      whistling a little tune to himself. A cup of coffee rests on the 
      dashboard. It starts to vibrate...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And very slowly, the Patrol Cop's attention 
      shifts away from his clipboard, as a bright source of light begins to glow 
      on the side of his face. He turns to see:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The Station parking lot - as bits of stray 
      garbage and newspaper begin to mysteriously swirl about in tiny vortexes 
      of energy - bits of light, almost like lightning, begin to pop and 
      crackle...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The Patrol Cop puts down his report, 
      interested...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">When the light coalesces and erupts into one 
      enormous FLASH - the opposite end of Willow's disappearing act in the 
      woods. And where the energy dissipates, there stands WILLOW, eyes and hair 
      black, head bowed, full of purpose.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She turns, sees the police station, and 
      strides toward it. The Patrol Cop, seeing her coming his way, gets out of 
      his car, puts a hand to his 9mm service sidearm...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">PATROL COP<br/>What the hell was 
      that? Listen,<br/>I don't know what you think you're<br/>doing, but you 
      better...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He puts a hand on her arm, but she pays no 
      attention. Without breaking stride or raising her voice, she 
      says:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Take a 
nap.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And on the word "nap," the Patrol Cop falls 
      against the car, then hits the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow doesn't notice or care. She stands 
      before the Sunnydale Police Station - sizing it up like an opponent, 
      probing it with her eyes for weaknesses.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We follow her gaze up from the front 
      entrance to the second story - and the cinder-blocked window spaces. 
      Willow stares at the one just above the main entrance.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Her eyes narrow. She 
concentrates.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And slowly, to the sound of stone grinding 
      against stone, we see CRACKS begin to appear in and around the plaster 
      surrounding one of the blocked windows. Bits of plaster flake off, and hit 
      the ground, crumbling.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">One of the CINDER BLOCKS within the window 
      space begins to vibrate, shake, and PULL LOOSE of its 
      moorings...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. CELL - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We now see Anya, desperation seeping in, as 
      she talks to the Officer outside the cell.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>... So please, stop 
      looking at me<br/>like it's your first trip to the<br/>circus and do your 
      job - let them<br/>out!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She stops as the sound of rumbling grows 
      around him. Looks around for the source. So do Jonathan and 
      Andrew.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>(scared)<br/>Oh, what 
      the hell is that?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>It's 
her.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And suddenly, behind them... an entire 
      CINDER BLOCK gets ripped out of place, yanked violently from its cemented 
      space. Startled, Jonathan and Andrew jump back from the phenomenon. Lights 
      from outside pour in the relatively dark cell. Some dust swirls about. The 
      Officer snaps out of his confusion. Gets official.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">OFFICER<br/>You three. Stay 
      here.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Oh, like we have a 
      choice!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">OFFICER<br/>I said, don't move. 
      You'll be<br/>safe here.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He runs off, down the hall. Anya calls after 
      him:</font></p>

      This is the<br/>one place they <i>won't</i> be safe!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A half-dozen COPS come rushing out from the 
      main entrance of the Police Station, alerted by the now-earthquake-like 
      rumbling all around them. Searching for its source, looking around, they 
      find - Willow.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Standing alone as cinder blocks and plaster 
      fly past her, pass overhead, and come crashing to the ground as if she 
      were tossing the stuff over her shoulder.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The Cops rush Willow. Annoyed, she merely 
      bows her head, looking right at them.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Back off.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And on her command, half the group lift off 
      their feet and go flying back away from her. Two of them land hard on 
      pavement, one of them crushes into the side of a patrol car.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow returns her attention to the window 
      above her.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: Buffy - as she comes running 
      around the side of the Police Station. She skids to a halt, taking in the 
      chaotic scene before her.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy makes a decision. She rushes back 
      around the side of the building she came from. Finds the side door. Grabs 
      the handle and YANKS it hard, splintering wood with the lock, and gaining 
      access to the Station.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She rushes inside...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Another cinder block yanks itself free. The 
      hole in the wall is now a gaping wound of stone and cement. Jonathan and 
      Andrew press themselves away from the wreckage as bricks go flying out the 
      wall, exposing them more with each passing moment. Freaking 
out.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Stop it! Just, 
      stop!<br/>(to Jonathan)<br/>Why is she doing this? Tell her!<br/>We didn't do 
      anything.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Yes we did. We 
      signed on. We<br/>teamed up. We wanted to see where<br/>all our plans would 
      take us, well<br/>take a look.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Angle on: the wall getting ripped apart, the 
      hole nearly big enough to walk through now...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>This is 
      it. The end of the road.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>For you, maybe. Anya! 
      Teleport<br/>us out of here. Take us with you!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>I can't. It doesn't 
      work that way.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Oh, 
      God.<br/>(yelling)<br/>HEEELP!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">BANG! We see a door labeled EMERGENCY EXIT, 
      just as a kick shatters it off its hinges. Alarms go off instantly, 
      blaring. Buffy enters, ignoring the alarms - to find herself standing in a 
      side corridor of the precinct.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She sees a small group of three COPS rush 
      through the main entrance, to the front.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Unseen by them, Buffy looks around, gets her 
      bearings, hears the sounds of demolition coming from upstairs. Runs up the 
      stairs, leaping them two and three at a time...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. JAIL CELL HALLWAY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy arrives at the doorway at the end of 
      the cell hall. It is locked. She takes a step back, rams her shoulder into 
      it, and just as it gives way we cut to:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow looking up. The heavy lifting is 
      done. Cinder blocks and plaster lie all around her. POLICE begin to 
      cautiously, guns drawn, surround her. But she smiles.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow's P.O.V.: the hole in the wall is now 
      big enough for Willow to fit through. So Willow gets eerily calm. Lowers 
      her hands, looking to the Cops surrounding her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Gotta fly.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And Willow simply FLIES STRAIGHT UP, toward 
      the hole in the second-story cell wall...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow enters, flying up through the hole in 
      the cell wall. Ready to claim her vengeance, she arrives in the boys's 
      cell - to find it empty.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She looks around, confused a moment, then 
      sees:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The cell bars have been ripped apart by 
      someone with Slayer-strength, and the guys are gone. Only Anya is left in 
      the hallway.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Willow - just, stop for 
      a second<br/>and listen to...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">With a single, powerful gesture, Willow 
      blasts Anya painfully away in a swirl of light and energy. Anya goes 
      smashing hard into the hallway wall, lands hard and goes slumping to the 
      floor. Conscious but in pain.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow whips her head around to face us 
      directly. She's got the scent now. And her eyes have gone completely 
      BLACK. And she looks furious. Her mouth opens, slowly at first, but 
      yawning wider and wider</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">As an inhuman SCREAM erupts out of her, her 
      face filled with inhuman fury. The scream sounds like a thousand banshees 
      dying in pain. It easily drowns out the blaring of the alarms. And the 
      scream and the rage still growing as we:</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy hustles Jonathan and Andrew along with 
      her as the three of them come bursting out of the side door of the Police 
      Station. We can still hear Willow's hideous, inhuman scream as it grows 
      from inside. Andrew and Jonathan cover their ears - in pain. But Buffy 
      grimaces and bears it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Aah! What is that 
      sound? God, it<br/>kills.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And the screaming grows, drowning out sound. 
      Our guys shout to be heard.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>We have to make a run 
      for it.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">But Andrew pulls away, freaking 
      out.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Are you kidding? 
      She's like Dark<br/>Phoenix up there! And you expect<br/>us to just outrun 
      her?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">SCREECH! A police SQUAD CAR comes pulling up 
      behind them, skidding to a halt. Xander's behind the wheel.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Pretty 
much.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Get in.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy rips the back door open to let Andrew 
      and Jonathan scramble inside. Buffy gives them a shove to help them along. 
      Then runs along the Squad Car as Xander starts to take off - gets in as 
      the car's already moving...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander hits the gas. The Squad Car peels 
      out, barreling through the phalanx of Cops, who part as the Squad Car 
      races through their ranks.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">A beat later. LOW ANGLE ON WILLOW, as she 
      stalks out of the main doors of the police station - on the hunt. (NOTE: 
      perhaps we do this in SLOW MOTION as well as at regular speed? Say 33 
      frames?) She glances up and down the street, ooking for any signs of 
      Buffy, Jonathan and Andrew. Seeing none, she moves off - full of grim 
      determination.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy pulls the door shut after her as 
      Xander, behind the wheel accelerates. He checks the rear view 
      mirror.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Is she 
      coming?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I don't see 
      anything.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy turns back to Andrew and 
      Jonathan.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You guys all 
      right?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We see what she sees: the two scaredest guys 
      ever. So she re-phrases the question.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Are you 
      injured?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>No. I, I don't 
      think so.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Where are you taking 
      us?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>We'll find someplace 
      safe and keep<br/>you there until we can stop Willow.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>"Run and hide?" 
      That's your<br/>brilliant plan?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(grumbling)<br/>I 
      don't believe this ...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Boys? If you don't 
      knock it off,<br/>I will pull this car over and you<br/>can just <u>walk</u>

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I don't get it. 
      Willow's a witch.<br/>Why doesn't she just ... you know<br/>... wave her 
      arms and make us dead?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>She doesn't want you 
      dead. She<br/>wants to kill you.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>But we didn't do 
      anything!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy PUNCHES Andrew square in the 
      nose.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW 
      (cont'd)<br/>Ow!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy turns back to Xander. He speaks as 
      confidentially as he can.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Hate to admit it, 
      Buff, but<br/>Jonathan may have a point. Why<br/>isn't she right here right 
      now?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Maybe, maybe she's 
      just getting<br/>her mojo up and running, or maybe<br/>she hasn't figured 
      out how much<br/>power she really has yet.<br/>(then)<br/>And neither have 
      we.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Guess we keep 
      running, then.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I still can't 
      believe that was<br/>Willow. I mean... I've known her<br/>almost as long as 
      you guys.<br/>Willow was... you know. She<br/>packed her own lunches and 
      wore<br/>floods and she was always... just<br/>Willow.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The truth of this hits Buffy and Xander The 
      car goes silent a moment. Only the rhythmic "thrum" of the wheels on the 
      highway sound. Then all of a sudden - BOOM! The entire car violently 
      ROCKS.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JQNATHAN (cont'd)<br/>Geez 
      it!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>What was 
      that?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Just 
      Willow.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: Xander's rear view mirror - we see 
      the grill of an EIGHTEEN WHEEL TRUCK fills the mirror's frame.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">OUTSIDE: We see the grill of the truck. Then 
      we travel up, over the grill, to see the DRIVER inside the cab, looking 
      terrified, struggling in vain to control the steering wheel which seems to 
      have a mind of its own.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We keep going up, to the ROOF of the truck's 
      cab, and there we see WILLOW, standing atop the cab, arms wide, hair 
      blowing, eyes black.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She looks like the maidenhead on a ship from 
      Hell.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">BOOM! The truck hits the squad car 
      again.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Any 
      ideas?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Drive 
      faster.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">BOOM! Another car-rocking hit. Xander 
      presses pedal to the metal...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: The chase. The Squad Car races as 
      fast as it can, but the truck has more momentum. Every time the Squad Car 
      pulls away, the truck catches up, bumping grill to back fender. 
      Grinding...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The car takes another hit. And this time, 
      the bumpers stay pressed together - the car getting pushed. Jonathan and 
      Andrew scream as the 18-wheeler bears down on the squad car. The crunching 
      sound of metal on metal grows to an unbearable Screeching...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Well, this is 
      faster...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>She knows you're in 
      this car too,<br/>right?<br/>(beat)<br/>Right?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Atop the truck, Willow, looking sweaty, 
      continues to exert control over the driver. She begins to 
      shake...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And the two vehicles separate - the truck 
      slows, just slightly. The Squad Car pulls ahead. Jonathan looks up at 
      Willow through the rear window.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>She's 
      draining...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>She's 
      what-ing?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Just keep 
      going.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow continues to shake, looking feverish, 
      sweaty... then falls forward, hard, now on all fours atop the truck's 
      cab.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The driver YANKS the steering wheel hard to 
      the left. The 18-wheeler makes as radical a turn as a vehicle that size 
      can. It JACK-KNIVES into a 90-degree angle upon itself. Everyone in the 
      car watches. Andrew can't help himself:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Cool.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The driver pulls out of the Jack-knife and 
      we see from Jonathan and Andrew's P.O.V. as the truck steers away from 
      them, growing small in their sight...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: Willow. Out of breath, out of 
      Magicks, just managing to clutch the top of the truck with her fingers, 
      holding on without any mystical aid. She turns her head and watches 
      ruefully as the squad car drives off.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The truck drives away down a long stretch of 
      road...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. SPIKE'S CRYPT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn, looking agitated - a fidgety bundle of

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Muscles just grins wickedly, and his FISTS 
      BURST INTO FLAME. They provide the only illumination in the cave, eerily

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow, looking a little wrecked after her 
      power outage on top of the truck, moves down a street in a deserted 
      industrial area. Despite her shaky appearance, her eyes burn with rage and 
      purpose. She will not be stopped.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We hear a key rattling frantically in a 
      doorway, and then the front door to the Magic Box opens fast. Anya leads 
      Xander and Buffy into the shop, followed by Jonathan and 
Andrew.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Thanks, Anya. For 
      getting here so<br/>fast. It's a big help.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>And once again, we find 
      Xander<br/>Harris needing the big help.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He looks to her. She ignores it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Whatever. So? Can you 
      still<br/>sense Willow?<br/>(more)</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Knowing her 
      location'd be a real<br/>comfort right about now.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Anya stops. Considers. Then:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>No. I can't. And that 
      means<br/>whatever she's feeling, it's gone<br/>way beyond simple 
      vengeance.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Did I mention the me 
      needing<br/><u>comfort</u>?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(to Anya)<br/>Whatever 
      we've got here, better<br/>grab it fast. This is going to be<br/>one of the 
      first places Willow<br/>would think to look for us.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Then what are we 
      doing here?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They all turn on him, annoyed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>You know - I 
      could summon a<br/>demon to kill her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>And I could smack you 
      so hard your<br/>eyeballs switch sockets.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No one is getting 
      killed. Sit<br/>down.<br/>(to Anya)<br/>We've got to find some kind 
      of<br/>Magicks that'll stop Willow.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>But she drained the 
      place.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He holds up a blank-faced text book, tosses 
      it aside.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Took 
      everything.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Not 
      everything.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Anya crosses behind the counter, starts 
      rummaging through drawers... She pulls out a KEY. Takes out a small BOX. 
      Inserts the key and opens the box. Pulls out a BOOK.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>What is 
it?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Book of protection 
      spells. Anti-<br/>Magic. Our last resort.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Think you can work 
      this stuff?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Anya opens the book.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Ah. Okay. The good news 
      is -<br/>text is intact. Bad news is - I<br/>can't read a word of it. 
      It's<br/>like in, ancient Sumerian or<br/>something.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan tentatively walks over to 
      them.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Can I take a look 
      at--</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Shut up.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Right.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He turns away. Turns back with:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>I just 
      thought, you know, as long<br/>as you're protecting us, the least<br/>I 
      could do is...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm not protecting 
      you, Jonathan.<br/>None of us are. We're doing this<br/>for Willow. And the 
      only reason<br/>it happens to be your lucky day is<br/>because if she kills 
      you, a line<br/>gets crossed, I lose a friend.<br/>And I hate 
      losing.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I get that. It's 
      just... you<br/>know she's running out of power,<br/>right? I could tell, I 
      could<br/>practically feel it.<br/>(embarrassed)<br/>I've dabbled in the 
      Magicks.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I'm thinking Willow's 
      in a league<br/>of her own about now, dabble-boy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>But still - running 
      that hot for<br/>that long...<br/>(shrugs)<br/>... Just a matter of time 
      before<br/>you gotta re-charge. No matter<br/>how juiced up you 
      are.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Thank you. Now 
      remember that<br/>thing we talked about?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>About me shutting 
      up?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy nods. Jonathan does, too. He points 
      awkwardly to the table and sits beside Andrew. Xander takes Buffy aside as 
      Anya researches the text.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Buffy, say this 
      works. And we<br/>stop Willow from working the<br/>hoodoo for a minute. What 
      then?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I talk to 
      her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Great. And say 
      what?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy just looks at Xander - she doesn't 
      have the answers. And he knows it. They share a moment of concern between 
      them, the two old friends. The possible survivors.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Whatever she's going 
      to do, she<br/>starts with these two. They're<br/>the line she cannot cross. 
      And if<br/>she's running low on the Magicks<br/>...she's probably somewhere 
      now<br/>trying to get it all back.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Clem and Dawn walk tentatively down a dark 
      street in a bad neighborhood. (NOTE: THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE SAME LOCATION 
      AS SCENE A17. THE STREET WILLOW WALKS DOWN.) Dawn is looking alert, 
      focused... While Clem looks distinctly uncomfortable.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Rack's place was right 
      around here<br/>last time...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>I don't feel 
      anything.<br/>(quickly)<br/>Oh well. Not here. Let's go home.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Clem starts to move off - but Dawn stops 
      him.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>You don't feel anything 
      because<br/>his place moves. I told you.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>Know why? Rack moves 
      all the<br/>time? Because he's shady. A bad<br/>element comes down 
      here.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I get that. But 
      Willow's part of<br/>it now... She is the element.<br/>Rack may know where 
      she is. Which<br/>is why we need to talk to him.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>(nervous)<br/>We? In 
      a... face to face way?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Or me. I'll go in 
      without you.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>(too casual)<br/>No, 
      it's fine. I'm good... It's<br/>just, Rack isn't partial to 
      the<br/>floppy-eared. He's got a thing.<br/>(then)<br/>But I'm in. 
      Absolutely.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Either way. Just get me 
      there.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn starts to move down the street again. 
      Clem hustles to keep up.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>Say Rack does. Know 
      where Willow<br/>is. He's not going to tell you<br/>for nothing. He's gonna 
      want<br/>something.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I have 
money.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>I don't think that's 
      the kind of<br/>something he's gonna want. Rack<br/>likes little girls 
      -</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(emphatic)<br/>I am not 
      a little girl.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Clem gets flustered, surprised by her sudden 
      intensity.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>Sorry. Of course. 
      Little, that's<br/>wrong. But girl, I stand behind.<br/>I mean, you 
      definately have...<br/>You're clearly... You have parts-</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn stops. Exasperated.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Look - are you going to 
      help me or<br/>not?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>I just - I don't know 
      if you've<br/>thought this through. I'm<br/>supposed to keep you safe and 
      this<br/>whole thing is... I mean, even<br/>if you find Willow, you 
      really<br/>think you can stop her?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I don't know. But I 
      can't sit<br/>around while another person I love-<br/>(stops/emotional)<br/>I 
      can't just sit around.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Clem takes this in. Gets the depth of pain 
      behind Dawn's actions. Relents.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>We don't have a plan. 
      Don't we at<br/>least need a plan?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Buffy and her friends 
      never have<br/>a plan. They just sort of... jump<br/>in and don't know what 
      they're<br/>doing.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>And this 
      works?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(shrugs)<br/>They never 
      really let me come<br/>along... Guess we'll find out.<br/>(off his 
      look)<br/>It's okay. I mean, they usually<br/>come back in one 
      piece.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">With that, Dawn moves off ahead. Clem lags a 
      moment, spooked.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>Usually?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">But Dawn is already a distance away. Clem 
      sighs, follows.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. RACK'S - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We see a strung-out looking JUNKIE,lying on 
      his back, eyes completely black, in the main room of RACK'S place. It's 
      like an opium den in here. And in the center of it all sits RACK, Lord of 
      all he surveys. Life is sweet for Rack. He lazily turns his head to his 
      side, addressing someone we cannot see:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RACK<br/>Hey, babe. I been 
      waiting for you.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And we see Willow stands before him. She's 
      just there.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RACK (cont'd)<br/>Guess the 
      rehab didn't take, huh.<br/>(shrugs)<br/>That's the way it goes 
      sometimes.<br/>But I gotta say:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He stands, walks over to Willow. She doesn't 
      move.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RACK (cont'd)<br/>I could feel 
      you coming a mile<br/>away, power you got. And you know<br/>something, 
      sweetness? I liked it.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He walks around her, getting seductive, in 
      his own way. That is to say, in a very creepy, predatory way. Still, the 
      vibe is not without sexuality. And still Willow says nothing.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RACK (cont'd)<br/>When you first 
      came to me, you<br/>were just a little slip of girl.<br/>(small 
      laugh)<br/>Look at you now. All growed up.<br/>Full of dark juice. And you 
      still<br/>taste like strawberries. Only now<br/>... you're ripe.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He stands before her, close, swaying 
      gently...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RACK (cont'd)<br/>You came 
      because you want<br/>something, don't you?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow nods, slowly, playing 
      him...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RACK (cont'd)<br/>Thought so. So 
      tell me,<br/>Strawberry...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He gently reaches out to touch her face, 
      whispers into her mouth:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">RACK (cont'd)<br/>What on this 
      earth do you want?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow reaches out, touching Rack's face in 
      return. Gently at first, but then her grip turns iron hard as she 
      smiles.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'm just gonna take a 
      little tour.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And with that Willow begins to SUCK THE 
      ENERGY out of Rack. It's horrible instantly. Mutli-colored tendrils of 
      light come ripping out of his head and body, directly into Willow. The 
      second it starts, Rack screams and we cut to:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. ANTEROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The air around Clem RIPPLES as he enters the 
      "waiting room" at Rack's. Followed immediately through the dimensional 
      portal by Dawn.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Yay, Clem, making with 
      the demon<br/>senses! I knew you'd find this<br/>place!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>(confidential)<br/>I 
      don't think it's very clean.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Don't wig out on me 
      again.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>I'm still not so sure 
      you should<br/>be here. I'm not so sure I should<br/>be here...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>It'll just take a 
      minute. Come on.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She steps forward, but sees Clem isn't 
      moving. She sighs</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN (cont'd)<br/>You want to 
      wait here?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">CLEM<br/>(forced casual)<br/>If 
      that works for you...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Be right 
      back.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn enters the main room, leaving Clem 
      behind, looking uncomfortable...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. RACK'S - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Alone, Dawn enters Rack's. The place is now 
      eerily silent. Dawn looks around, takes tentative steps further in, 
      slowly, cautiously.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Willow?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn moves further in. Stops, looking 
      around. And we see, behind her, there slowly (almost peacefully) floats 
      the desiccated, mummified CORPSE of Rack. Hanging upside-down as if in 
      zero gravity, slowly turning, arms splayed wide at his side - more than 
      dead. Sucked dry.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn slowly turns - and literally comes 
      face-to-face with the sunken eyed corpse of Rack.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn SCREAMS.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Then she turns to run out - but then stops 
      cold - finding herself face-to-face with Willow.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And Willow looks worse than ever. There's 
      plenty of magic flowing through her - all of it dark. Her skin more pale, 
      almost white. Dark veins reach across her face. Her lips are bluish-black, 
      cracked and dry, her eyes completely black.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She smiles.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hey, 
cutie.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Dawny, what are you

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(shrugs)<br/>It's an 
      improvement. Believe me.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I gotta go.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn turns, bolts for the door - only to 
      find Willow standing there already. Dawn summons her courage.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Why? So you can run 
      and tell<br/>Buffy?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Willow. Just, listen to

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>You're freaking me 
      out.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn backs away. Willow walks forward, 
      non-threatening. Friendly.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Don't be like that

      cry?<br/>(before she answers)<br/>Of course you did. I get that, 
      I<br/>understand the crying, you cry<br/>because you're human. But 
      you<br/>weren't always.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No - please, you're

      "Dawny." You<br/>don't belong here.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow gets up in Dawn's face.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Wanna go 
      back? End the pain?<br/>You'll be happier. I'd be<br/>happier. We'll all be 
      a lot<br/>happier without having to listen<br/>to all your constant 
      whining.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn starts to tear up, fighting her

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(mocking)<br/>"Mom!" 
      "Buffy!" "Tara!" Waah!<br/>Come on, someone's gotta stop the<br/>carnage. 
      It's time you went back<br/>to being a little energy ball.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn stands trapped against a far wall as

      echo of its own accord.</font></p>

      tears, Dawny.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn shuts her eyes - and we hear the sound 
      of something solid CRACKING violently and fast, Willow turns - to see 
      Buffy, who stands in the just-kicked-open doorway. Buffy looks thrown but 
      determined.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I think you need to 
      get away from<br/>her.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Back in the Magic Box. And it's some 
      slow-going. Anya turns page after page of the Protection Spell text. 
      Xander, holding a small translation manual, looks on over her shoulder. 
      Without looking up, she says:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>You're too 
      close.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>How am I supposed to

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>I don't know. I'm

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>How's the translation 
      coming?<br/>What have we got so far?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA (cont'd)<br/>(beat)<br/>I 
      can't do this. I'm in retail.<br/>Stupid ancient Sumerians...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN (O.S.)<br/>It's not 
      Sumerian.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Anya and Xander look up to see Jonathan 
      standing before them, looking contrite.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I'm pretty sure 
      it's Babylonian.<br/>The text is similar, but it's a<br/>whole different 
      dialect.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Beat. Xander puts away his translation 
      text.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Great. Babylonian. 
      Because you<br/>know, that's easy.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They get back to work, ignoring Jonathan. He 
      sits back down. Andrew sits close to him, pissed. He harshly 
      whispers:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Why are you helping 
      them?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Because they're 
      saving our lives,<br/>you moron.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Uh-huh. And what 
      then? Even if<br/>they kill that Wicca bitch, you<br/>think they'll just let 
      us walk?<br/>They own us.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>So what do you want 
      me to do?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Look around. You know 
      Magick.<br/>We're in a Magic Shop.<br/>(intense)<br/>We can take 
      them.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He shoots a look to Anya and Xander. 
      Jonathan just looks at him like he's insane, but Andrew sells 
      it:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW (cont'd)<br/>The books 
      are sucked, dry, but so<br/>what? - There's still like tons of<br/>supplies 
      all around us - this is<br/>the best chance we're gonna get to<br/>make it 
      out of here.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>And do 
      what?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Start over We can be 
      the Duo.<br/>You and me, you can even be the<br/>leader, I swear, I'll take 
      orders.<br/>I like orders.<br/>(lost)<br/>Just tell me what to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan thinks it over.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>You want an 
      order?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Then suddenly Jonathan GRABS Andrew and 
      SHOVES him so hard into the bookshelf, it shudders.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN (cont'd)<br/>Grow 
      up.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Jonathan releases him.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Hey now - play nice, 
      fellas, or<br/>you'll break our concentration.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Which means no 
      protection spell...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>And Willow will make 
      sure you two<br/>boneless chickens are skinless, too.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANDREW<br/>Then what? You think 
      your Li'l<br/>Witch buddy's gonna stop with us?<br/>You saw her! She's a 
      truck<br/>driving Magic Mamma. We've got<br/>maybe seconds before 
      Darth<br/>Rosenberg grinds everybody into<br/>Jawa-burgers, and not one of

      a point.<br/>What if Willow filets their sole<br/>and then comes after 
      --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>She won't.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>You don't know 
      that.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>We're her friends, 
      Anya. Her<br/>family. She would never hurt us.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>She tried to use you 
      for a hood<br/>ornament, Xander. She doesn't<br/>care if you live or 
      die.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander knows she's right. It's a bitter 
      realization.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Guess you two finally

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>I care if you live or

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Again with the 
      comfort. Look, we<br/>both know things might get ugly at<br/>Wiccapalooza. 
      If it gets <u>really</u><br/>bad --</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Let me guess. You'll 
      propose.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander presses it - cuts right to the 
      chase:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I need to know if 
      you're gonna<br/>turn on me.<br/>(more)</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Use this 
      little shindig as an<br/>excuse for some sweet revenge.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She turns to him. Direct:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>There is nothing in 
      this world<br/>that could give me greater or more<br/>lasting satisfaction 
      than reaping<br/>bloody vengeance upon you, Xander<br/>Harris.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander nods, absorbing this.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA (cont'd)<br/>But I 
      can't!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Even the nerds sit up and take notice of 
      this.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA (cont'd)<br/>Not 
      officially, not magically --<br/>So smile, it's your lucky day.<br/>You got 
      away with it. I can't hurt<br/>you.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Right, 'cause you 
      varnishing the<br/>table with Spike -- how could that<br/>possibly have 
      hurt? It may have<br/><u>chaffed</u>...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(gently)<br/>That wasn't 
      vengeance. It<br/>was solace.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">That hurts Xander more than anything she's 
      said.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA (cont'd)<br/>I really can't 
      hurt you. So I'll<br/>just have to settle for hating you.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>If that's what you 
      need to do.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Don't. You don't get to 
      play the<br/>martyr.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I'm not.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>None of this would be 
      happening if<br/>it weren't for you.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You think I don't 
      know that? You<br/>think I'm the hero of this piece?<br/>I saw the gun. 
      Before Warren even<br/>raised it, I saw it, and... I couldn't<br/>move. He 
      shot two of my friends<br/>before I could even... You want me<br/>to know 
      how useless I am? That<br/>it's my fault? Thanks. Already<br/>got the 
      memo.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(a beat, then 
      sadly)<br/>I was talking about us.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander pushes his guilt and pain back 
      down.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You want to hate me, 
      you want to<br/>make me suffer for what I did to you --<br/>fine. Do 
      whatever you want.<br/>(beat)<br/>After we save Willow.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He goes back to studying. Anya, still 
      watching, cannot help feeling some kind of sympathy. But there's nothing 
      left to say. She turns back to her own book. They go back to studying,

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Dawn tries to leave, but the door is locked

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Don't. We're all

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know what you want 
      to do,<br/>Willow, but listen to me: the<br/>forces inside you are 
      incredibly<br/>powerful. They're strong, but<br/>you're stronger. Just 
      remember -<br/>you're still Willow.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Let me tell you 
      something about<br/>Willow: she's a loser. And she<br/>always has been. 
      Everyone picked<br/>on Willow in junior high, high<br/>school, up until 
      college with her<br/>stupid mousy ways and now -<br/>Willow's a 
      junkie.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I can help.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>The only thing Willow 
      was ever<br/>good for...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She starts to come down, just a 
      fraction...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>- the only 
      thing going for me -<br/>were those moments - just<br/>moments - when Tara 
      would look at<br/>me and I was wonderful.<br/>(beat)<br/>And that will never 
      happen again.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know - this hurts,

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Why not?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Because you lose 
      everything. Your<br/>friends, your self... you let this<br/>control you and 
      the world goes<br/>away. That's not... Willow,<br/>there's so much to 
      --</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy hesitates - just a beat, but long 
      enough for Willow's eyes to narrow. She can tell Buffy's 
      bullshitting.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Ack! Please! This is 
      your pitch?<br/>You hate it here as much as I do.<br/>I'm just more honest 
      about it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's not 
      true...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">As Willow speaks, the camera swirls around 
      her in those Brian DePalma-y 360-degree arcs. But if we're really paying

      as she continues...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You're trying to sell 
      me on the<br/>world. The one where you lie to<br/>your friends when you're 
      not<br/>trying to kill them and you screw<br/>a vampire just to feel and 
      insane<br/>asylums are the comfy alternative.<br/>This world? Buffy, it's 
      me! I<br/>know you were happier in the<br/>ground - hanging with the 
      worms.<br/>The only time you were ever at<br/>peace in your whole life is 
      when<br/>you were dead.<br/>(beat)<br/>Until Willow brought you

      past her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Will...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Don't.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Guys... c'mon. I'm 
      getting the<br/>wood for the violence here. And<br/>you know what they say - 
      if at<br/>first you don't succeed...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She BLASTS the guys again. And we cut 
      to:</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. AFRICAN CAVE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike falls hard onto a dirt floor in a 
      cave. He's been badly beaten, and his body bears more than a few scorch 
      marks. Barely able to lift his head, he spits blood, stands wobbling on 
      his feet...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Had enough?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">In answer, a FLAMING FIST cracks Spike 
      square in the face. And Muscles starts to pound Spike. It's nearly over. 
      Spike takes a flaming fist to the stomach - doubles over in 
      agony.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Another shot heads for his face. Spike holds 
      up a bare palm and catches the punch. Flesh sizzles.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Ow! Badmove 
      badmove badmove...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Spike backs up. Muscles approaches him, 
      mayhem in his eyes, and goes for the killer blow when Spike grabs him, 
      rolls with him, gets to his feet first and just manages to kick Muscles in 
      the balls.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Muscles goes down. Spike leaps upon him and 
      (out of frame) CRACKS HIS NECK.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">It's over. Spike barely manages to get to 
      his feet, but manage he does. He stands, ringed by the flaming torches. He 
      wipes the blood from his mouth, wearily triumphant.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">He staggers forward. And we see (almost) 
      whom he is addressing: the GLIMPSE OF DEMON we saw lurking in the darkness 
      in episode 20. Fangs. Eyes. Tail.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Looks like 
      local boy loses.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">VOICE<br/>So it would 
      appear.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Good on me, then. So? 
      I get what<br/>I came for? I passed, right?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">VOICE<br/>Indeed. You have 
      passed the first<br/>stage of the test.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Right, then I... 
      wait... <i>first</i><br/><u>stage</u>?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Long silence.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">SPIKE 
      (cont'd)<br/>Bugger.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We are close on Willow's face as she sends 
      waves of energy shooting from her fingertips. She stops, a little 
      frustrated now.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Damn, that is one 
      effective counter-spell.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Reverse angle reveals Jonathan and Andrew. 
      Still untouched.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>(to 
      Jonathan)<br/>Won't keep you alive, though.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Will, stop. You have 
      to give this<br/>up, now.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(ignoring 
      Buffy)<br/>Oh, I get it. You boys put a<br/>spell on yourselves, didn't 
      you.<br/>On everyone here. Protecting you<br/>from harm - from Magicks. 
      That's<br/>cute.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy GRABS Willow, but Willow just keeps 
      talking to the guys, ignoring Buffy entirely.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I used to be 
      cute. Now I'm just<br/>incredibly powerful, so, whatever<br/>the problem is 
      - I know it's not<br/>me.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She walks toward them. Buffy backs up with 
      her, playing defense, always standing between Willow and the 
      boys.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Will - back off before 
      somebody<br/>gets hurt.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>How about I back off 
      right after?<br/>(to boys)<br/>So which one of you worked 
      the<br/>mojo?</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">They're both too petrified to 
      answer.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON: Anya, out of sight, keeping the 
      spell going.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Back to Willow, moving in on the guys, Buffy 
      in the way, Dawn and Xander watching...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Doesn't 
      matter, really. I'm just<br/>curious.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She points to the boys.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Just because 
      I can't do Magicks to<br/>you, doesn't mean I can't do 'em<br/>on 
      myself.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And a pillar of swirling energies surround 
      Willow - sending Buffy back. The energies then dissipate in a flash. 
      Willow smiles, looks at her own hands, walking toward the 
      boys...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">The boys rush around to put the Magic box 
      table between themselves and the approaching Willow</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>All right. Now, I'm 
      pretty sure<br/>I'm strong enough...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">As she approaches, Willow grabs hold of the

      across the room with one shove.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>...To beat 
      you to death.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow rushes toward the boys. Buffy gets in 
      her way. Blocking her path. They square off. We take a moment with it. See 
      Buffy's determination. See Willow's eagerness.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't want to hurt 
      you.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow PUNCHES Buffy so hard, Buffy's entire

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Not a

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She turns back to the guys. Rushes them,

      Buffy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I said I didn't want 
      to.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy PUNCHES Willow so hard she crashes up 
      against the vertical glass display case, smashing it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Didn't say I 
      wouldn't.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow g1ares in shock. The boys run behind 
      Buffy towards Xander. Xander gathers together Andrew, Jonathan and Dawn. 
      They start to get out, but Dawn hesitates, afraid of what could happen, 
      not wanting to leave.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I'm getting you out 
      of here.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>What about 
      Willow?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Buffy can handle 
      her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Are you 
sure?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>No - that's why we're 
      leaving.<br/>Come on!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander grabs the guys and Dawn and hustles 
      them out the front entrance. Before they make it out, Xander stops, turns 
      - and sees Anya.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>I have to stay to keep 
      the spell<br/>going on Willow.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>But...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Do something 
      right.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She says this harsh sentence without even 
      looking at him. After a split-second's hesitation, Xander leaves, taking 
      Dawn and the guys with him.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow sees this - and she ain't happy about 
      it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow gets to her feet from the bits of 
      shattered display case and heads after Jonathan and Andrew - when Buffy 
      grabs hold of her arm, pulling her back.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(to 
      guys)<br/>Go!</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow watches the boys get out the door - 
      gone. Buffy stands between Willow and the door. Willow's got to get past 
      Buffy to get her vengeance - and Buffy's not gonna let that happen. This 
      is it. And both women know it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>So. Here we 
      are.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Are we really gonna do 
      this?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Come on! This is a 
      huge deal for<br/>me! Six years as a side man, and<br/>now I get to be the 
      Slayer.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>A killer isn't a 
      Slayer. Being a<br/>Slayer means something you can't<br/>conceive 
      of.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh, Buffy. You really 
      need to<br/>have every square inch of your ass<br/>kicked.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Then show me what you 
      got. And<br/>I'll show you what a Slayer is.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And it's on. Willow throws a punch at Buffy. 
      Buffy blocks it, spins Willow, nearly breaking her arm. But Willow throws 
      Buffy back, slamming her into a bookshelf.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow points - and the LADDER comes sliding 
      across the length of the wall, smashing into Buffy, sending her into the 
      wall. Buffy tries to get to Willow, but OBJECTS come flying at Buffy from 
      all directions. Books - a chair - a statue... each one a direct hit to the 
      head, the ribs, the face...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy gets out of the line of fire and makes 
      a flying tackle - grabbing Willow - the two of them hit the 
      ground.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Get off, super 
      bitch.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow SIDEKICKS Buffy with enough force to 
      send Buffy THROUGH THE COUNTER, shattering glass.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy comes right back at Willow - grabbing 
      hold of her.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I can help you 
      stop.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I thought you were 
      gonna show me<br/>what a Slayer was.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow punches Buffy - sending her through 
      the counter-side bookshelf and curtain - and REVEALING the startled Anya, 
      book in hand. Chanting.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Well, hey. 
      That's interesting.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Buffy, losing steam, tries to get between 
      Willow and Anya.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Anya's still 
      here...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow SHOVES Buffy through the small 
      front-room table.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Chanting her 
      little heart out...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She faces the terrified Anya 
      directly.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>And I think 
      I've been beating on<br/>the wrong gal.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Anya's eyes go wide with terror. She starts 
      to run. But, lightning-fast, Willow GRABS Anya - and lifts her off the 
      ground - Anya keeps her incantation going, terrified, louder ...then stops 
      to yell out:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>HELP 
      ME!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Can't block my spells 
      if you can't<br/>chant. And you can't chant if<br/>you're 
      sleepin'...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She hurls her aside.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Xander leads Jonathan, Andrew and Dawn down 
      an alley way side street in Sunnydale.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I don't

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And Xander leads the three of them deep off 
      into the night, small lonely figures, silhouetted and swallowed up by the 
      night surrounding them...</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We see the far wall of the Magic Box - just 
      as Anya comes CRASHING INTO IT. She lands amidst a pile of books as she 
      comes slumping groggily to the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow turns on Buffy, who's rushing her.

      you - I get it<br/>now. The Slayer thing really<br/><i>isn't</i> about the 
      violence.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow surrounds herself with energies 
      streaming in at her from all directions - as if she were collecting 
      strength, the center of some great cosmic vortex.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>It's about 
      the power.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Willow's eyes go BLACK.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She lifts her hands and BLASTS Buffy with

      and tries but cannot get up.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>And there's

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">And the second she says this, Willow gets

<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">She slides to a stop. Her nose is bleeding.
