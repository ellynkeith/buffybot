<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FADE UP:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. PARK - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As we move through a wooded park area -- and 
      land on A PAIR OF TRUNK-LIKE, NOT QUITE HUMAN LEGS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now we PAN UP the legs and see BUFFY'S FEET 
      DANGLING, kicking. In a moment we get the whole picture - Buffy is in the 
      IRON GRIP of A HUGE, HIDEOUS DEMON. He's got her by the neck, and she's 
      flailing - gasping.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: XANDER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Is picking himself painfully up, obviously 
      reeling from a blow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Rifles through Buffy's weapon bag nearby - 
      frantic.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh, God, Oh, God - Demon, 
      demon -<br/>what kills a demon?!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Hears this - tries to talk, 
      unsuccessfully.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Knurrppppph!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON WILLOW</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh! Nurf? Not nurf! 
      Knife!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow snatches a ceremonial KNIFE from the 
      bag. She TOSSES it to Buffy - who catches it and THRUSTS it into the 
      demon's belly. The demon BELLOWS AND DIES. Both he and Buffy fall to the 
      ground with a painful THUD.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A long BEAT as they re-group. Xander and 
      Willow move to Buffy - help her to her feet.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay. That was too close 
      for<br/>comfort. Not that slaying is ever comfy...<br/>(then)<br/>But you 
      know what I mean. If you<br/>guys hadn't been here to help-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(shaken)<br/>But we were. And 
      we did. And we're all fine.<br/>(re: demon)<br/>Isn't he gonna go 
      poof?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I guess these guys don't. 
      We'll have<br/>to bury him or something. Makes you<br/>appreciate vampires. 
      No muss, no fuss.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>How come Faith was a no show? 
      I thought<br/>the mucussy demons were her favorites.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Couldn't reach her -- again. 
      She hasn't<br/>been hanging out much. Off by herself.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I detect 
      worry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Little bit. Slaying's a hard 
      gig --<br/>too much alone time isn't always<br/>healthy. Stuff gets pent 
      up.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>We should try to do more 
      socializing with her.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Well, burial detail aside, 
      does this<br/>cap us off for the day?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You got plans?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I cannot stress enough how 
      much I<br/>don't have plans.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No luck reaching 
      Cordelia?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I left a few messages, sixty 
      or seventy...<br/>(suddenly soapboxy)<br/>And you know what bugs me? Okay, 
      we<br/>were kissing, it's wrong, but I know<br/>that was positively the last 
      time we<br/>ever would have kissed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Darn tootin'.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>And they burst in, rescuing 
      us<br/>without even knocking, I mean this is<br/>really all their 
      fault.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The girls look at him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Your logic does not resemble 
      our Earth-logic.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(sheepishly)<br/>Mine is more 
      advanced.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>At least tomorrow's Monday. 
      Another school day.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's right. Focus on 
      school.<br/>Focus on yourself. That's the strong<br/>Willow way to 
      heal.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Actually -- I was more 
      thinking "Oz<br/>will be there and I can beg for 
      forgiveness."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That works 
too.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I want to be strong Willow. 
      But then<br/>when I think I might not ever get to<br/>be close to Oz 
      again... it's like all<br/>the air goes out of the room.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know the 
      feeling.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They rise. Buffy grabs the demon's legs. Her 
      friends immediately flank her, ready to help drag him off.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Right. You've been through it 
      all<br/>with Angel and you're still standing.<br/>So, tell us, wise one, how 
      do you deal?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She contemplates. Then, simply --</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I have you 
      guys.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They start to drag him off toward the 
      bushes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CORDELIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A PHOTOGRAPH OF XANDER, WILLOW, BUFFY and 
      CORDELIA - as a large pair of SCISSORS come into frame and cuts each one 
      out, separating them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">In the background we can hear XANDER'S voice 
      on an answering machine.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER (0.C.)<br/>Hey. It's Xander. If 
      you get this, call me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now we MOVE UP to see that it's CORDELIA who 
      is doing the slice and dice job while she ignores the phone machine. Her 
      eyes are red from crying and she looks just about as bad as an incredibly 
      beautiful person can look.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER (O.C.)<br/>(new message)<br/>Hi. 
      Xander... I, uh, well, I'm in if<br/>you feel like talking. 
      Bye.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now we WIDEN and see that she's wearing 
      sweats and a sports top - and a LARGE WHITE BANDAGE that spans one side of 
      her torso, covering the injury she sustained in episode 8. We also see 
      that her ROOM is a TOTAL MESS. Littered with clothes and diet soda cans 
      and junk food wrappers...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She slices the heads off Buffy and 
      Willow.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER (O.C.)<br/>(new message)<br/>Hi, 
      Cordelia.... Uh....</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Cordy takes the Xander portion and 
      LIGHTS it on fire with a match. She drops it into an ashtray - watches the 
      FUMES RISING - her expression betraying the chilling mix of hurt and fury 
      that is unmistakably the look of a woman scorned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON PHOTO</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As XANDER, BUFFY &amp; WILLOW'S faces 
      shrivel and burn.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER (O.C.)<br/>(new message)<br/>If 
      you get the chance... if we can<br/>talk... I'm here...</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Another bustling day at Sunnydale High as 
      Buffy joins Willow - who is looking more than a little anxious.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>How's it 
going?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oz hasn't been to his locker. 
      There<br/>may be books in there that he needs,<br/>but still he doesn't 
      come.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What about Cordy? Has Xander 
      seen her?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I don't think so. But she is 
      coming<br/>in today. Amy saw her last night at the mall.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>How was she?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I don't know. Amy said she 
      looked<br/>pretty scary.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - PARKING LOT - 
      DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see a CARETAKER with his cleaning cart as 
      the camera MOVES ACROSS FRAME. Cordelia's convertible SCREECHES into the 
      parking lot and zips into a parking space.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The car door opens. A WICKED STILETTO HEEL 
      hits the pavement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WIDEN TO SHOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA, drop dead in A KILLER designer 
      outfit and dark shades. Totally transformed from the night before - she 
      looks both sexy and sinister.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. FOUNTAIN COURT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordelia moves into the fountain court, 
      which is bustling. Many heads turn and there are some whispers - it's 
      clear that the word is out about her and Xander. Now Cordy spots HARMONY 
      and the Cordettes at one end of the quad with another girl that Cordy 
      doesn't recognize. There is a moment of hesitancy on both sides. Then 
      Harmony moves toward Cordy-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>(giving "air 
      kiss")<br/>Cordelia. You look amazing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now THE NEW GIRL we saw standing with them, 
      ANYA, moves over with the rest of the Cordettes. Like Cordy, she's 
      incredibly turned out - a real stunner.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>You have to meet Anya. She 
      just<br/>moved here. Her dad bought - what<br/>was it? A utility or 
      something.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anya smiles. Gives Cordy the once over - as 
      Cordy does the same to her. Notices her shoes.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Nice bag. 
Prada?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy's clearly surprised by Anya's educated 
      guess.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Good call. Most people 
      around here<br/>can't tell Prada from Payless.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>What can I say? I have an eye 
      for<br/>the good stuff.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They'd go on but Harmony takes Cordy's arm. 
      Speaks to her in a conspiratorial tone.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>God - Cordy, when I heard 
      about...<br/>I mean, I just couldn't believe it.<br/>But it was smart - the 
      "injury"<br/>thing? You take a week off. Let<br/>everybody forget the 
      temporary<br/>insanity that was Xander Harris...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy gets her drift. Decides to go 
      along.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Xander who?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony and the others laugh. Cordelia 
      brightens - it looks like she's back in the fold.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDETTE #1<br/>You know what you have 
      to do. Start<br/>dating. Get back on the horse.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Absolutely. I'm ready to 
      ride.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Then I have the stallion. 
      He's so you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Perfect! Lead the 
      way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony and the minions PART and all look 
      at-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who sits under a tree, sipping on a BIG 
      GULP. He notices the girls. Checks to see if it's really him they're 
      looking at. Yep. He waves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON CORDELIA, HARMONY, ET AL.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony smiles cruelly at Cordy - enjoying 
      every minute of her humiliation.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>I'm pretty sure he won't 
      cheat on<br/>you. At least not for a while.<br/>(then)<br/>Plus - he's got a 
      kill moped.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now the girls LAUGH. Except Anya - who 
      appears too cool for such silliness. Still - Cordy's stunned. Frozen in 
      place.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With that - Harmony moves off. Like 
      lemmings, the rest of the girls follow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz moves to his locker. A beat and WILLOW 
      appears from around a corner. Tries to look surprised.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oz! wow. Look at us. Running 
      into<br/>each other - as two people who go to<br/>the same school are so 
      likely to do<br/>now and then...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He turns. Looks at her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Hey.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And that's it. He starts to move down the 
      hall. Will grabs his arm. Stops him, desperate.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oz. Wait. Please. I don't 
      want<br/>to - but I'm capable of scene-making.<br/>Hallway scene 
      making.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz waits. Says nothing.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay. Okay.<br/>(then)<br/>I 
      can't even... What I did - when I<br/>think that I hurt 
      you...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>You said all this stuff 
      already.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Right. But... I want to make 
      it up<br/>to you. I mean, if you'll let me -I<br/>want to 
      try.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz takes this in.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Just - you can leave me alone. 
      I<br/>need to figure things out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Figuring. That's something. 
      It means<br/>there's still a me and you to figure.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I don't know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But - if we talk now. Maybe 
      we could-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz stops her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I'm sorry you're having a hard 
      time<br/>with this. But I told you what I need.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>So I can't help feeling like 
      the<br/>reason you want to talk is so you can<br/>feel better about 
      yourself.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>(then)<br/>And that's not my 
      problem.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He closes his locker and walks off, leaving 
      Will ashamed and speechless.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL - LOUNGE AREA - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy walks near the lounge - holding her 
      head up despite the obvious stares and whispers of her peers. Now she 
      spots XANDER rounding a corner and heading right toward her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Desperate - Cordy grabs hold of A HANDSOME 
      JOCK, JOHN LEE, who is also walking in her direction.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>(sweetly)<br/>Hey John Lee - 
      do I have something<br/>caught in my teeth?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Still holding on to him with both hands - 
      she smiles big. John Lee leans into her - looks at her mouth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Stops as he sees CORDELIA AND JOHN LEE in 
      what could be, from his vantage point, a fairly intimate conversation or 
      perhaps even a kiss. He looks like he's taken a gut shot - turns and moves 
      off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON CORDY AND JOHN LEE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Cordy notes Xander's retreat. She stops 
      gripping John Lee - but still works the charm.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>So - what's new? It's been, 
      like,<br/>A gazillion years.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">John Lee's eyes dart the hall. He talks low, 
      conspiratorially.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOHN LEE<br/>Look. The guys are kind of 
      down on<br/>me right now. Coach just cut me back<br/>to second string. If

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now JOHN LEE sees some buddies coming down

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOHN LEE<br/>Think about 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Nearly in a daze now - Cordy turns and runs

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordelia - anticipating further humiliation, 
      cuts her off.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Go ahead - dazzle me with

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(genuinely 
      surprised)<br/>Hardly. I've been looking for you.<br/>When we met this 
      morning, I was<br/>like - thank God! There's one other<br/>person in town 
      who actually reads "W".</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>But, 
      Harmony-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Follows me around. It's like, 
      if she<br/>had an original thought her head<br/>would 
      explode.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordelia takes this in - warming to 
      her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Tell me about 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>And she's all tweeked about 
      some guy<br/>you were dating? Have we finished<br/>seventh grade 
      already?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordelia laughs - notices the EXOTIC PENDANT 
      that Anya wears.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Is it 
Gucci?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>No. It's an actual old thing - 
      a<br/>good luck charm my dad gave me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Too bad. I didn't have one

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Seconded.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Apart from being without class, 
      the<br/>guy's obviously blind. Deserves<br/>whatever he 
gets.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>I'm not even thinking of 
      him. I'm<br/>past it. Living my life.</font></center>

      wish he'd --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>I don't wish. I act. 
      Starting now,<br/>Xander Harris is going to get a<br/>bellyful1 of just how 
      over him I am.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BRONZE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander sits with Buffy and Willow, watching 
      the kids on the dance floor - trying not to look suicidal. Some LOUD 
      laughter draws his attention. CORDELIA and ANYA stand at another table - 
      with boys, and having a high old time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander takes this in -- laughs at a remark 
      of Buffy's. Not satisfied that they noticed, he continues to laugh until 
      he is bellowing. He stops when he realizes that he is a grotesque 
      freak.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy and Anya look at him, at each other -- 
      what a loser. Actually, Buffy and Willow share not entirely different 
      looks.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Excuse me? I need to be both 
      giving<br/>and receiving mirth. Is it too much<br/>to ask for a little back

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't know, Xand. I'm here 
      for<br/>you. I'm supporto gal. But I feel<br/>kind of funny doing the "us

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(stricken)<br/>It's true. 
      Cordy belongs to the<br/>"justified" camp. She should make us<br/>pay. And 
      pay and pay and pay and<br/>pay... In fact, there's really not<br/>enough 
      "pay" to make up for-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(cutting her off)<br/>You want 
      to do guilt-a-palooza?<br/>Fine. But I'm done with that.<br/>Starting this 
      minute - I'm going to<br/>grab a hold of that crazy little<br/>thing called 
      life and let it do it's<br/>magic heal-y thing. What's done is<br/>done. 
      Let's be in the moment. Behold<br/>the beauty that is now! Who's with 
      me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's true. We're young and 
      free in<br/>America... How dare we be spun by<br/>love - or the lack of 
      same?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(trying)<br/>Absolutely. It's 
      self indulgent.<br/>I'm in. I'm on the joy train.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A long beat as they all smile. Bop their 
      heads to the music - look around at the passing Bronzers. Then, 
      abruptly-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That didn't work. Who wants 
      chocolate?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow and Xander raise their hands - Buffy 
      moves off. Xander absently covers Will's hand with his - worrying it as he 
      glances at Cordelia.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Look at her. Tears of a 
      clown, baby.<br/>Or, more like, grins of a sad person.<br/>Or is 
      it-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow looks at Xander's hand. Cuts him 
      off.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Xander. Your 
      hand.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander realizes what he's doing. Takes his

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Oops. Sorry.<br/>(thinks it 
      over)<br/>But why - "oops?" We've always<br/>touched digits. It's just 
      friend<br/>stuff. Comfort - like chocolate.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Maybe it used to be. But now 
      that<br/>we... It's different.<br/>(off his look)<br/>I'm sorry. But if I 
      ever want to<br/>make things right with Oz - my hands,<br/>my... everything 
      - they have to be<br/>for him only.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander takes this in - nods. And they just 
      sit there. Silent and uncomfortable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BRONZE - COUNTER - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's in line when she sees CORDELIA 
      saying good night to Anya and heading for the door. She watches as Cordy 
      tries to conceal a WINCE of pain when someone bumps into her. Buffy makes 
      a decision. Follows.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE BRONZE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy runs after Cordy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hey, Cordelia? Wait

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy rolls her eyes. Stops.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Did Xander send you to beg 
      for him?<br/>because if he did-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm a free agent, I promise. I 
      just<br/>wanted to see how you are.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Never been 
      better.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy starts to walk away. Buffy 
      pursues.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No - hey... I was just going 
      to<br/>say - if there's anything I can do...<br/>If you need 
      anything-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>You know what I need? To be 
      rid of<br/>Xander and all things Xander - like<br/>his spooky 
      entourage.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She starts off. Buffy stops her one more 
      time.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Please. Cordelia. I know what 
      it's<br/>like to be hurt by someone. Hurt so<br/>much - you think you're not 
      going to make it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordelia hears this. Her eyes flick to 
      Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>The only thing that helped? I 
      told<br/>my friends how I felt. And it got a<br/>little 
      better.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat. Cordy looks like she might relent. 
      She starts to say something when - BAM! A LARGE VAMP jumps Buffy. She 
      throws him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Do you mind? We were 
      talking!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He comes up again, Buffy punches him

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Cordy, look --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">-- right into Cordy. They fall into a pile 
      of garbage bags and cans.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>-- out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy whips out a stake as he rises and 
      stakes the bum.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy emerges from a large HEAP OF TRASH, 
      holding her side and clearly hurting. Her designer dress is ruined and 
      she's covered in GARBAGE. To add insult to injury - HARMONY and the other 
      CORDETTES come out of the Bronze and see her in this disheveled state. 
      They can't - nor do the try to - contain their glee. Cordy turns on Buffy, 
      fuming.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>You know what I've been 
      asking myself<br/>a lot this last week? Why me? Why<br/>do I get impaled? 
      Why do I get bitten<br/>by snakes? Why do I fall for<br/>incredible

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. FOUNTAIN COURT - DAY</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>-Buffy Summers. That's when 
      all my<br/>troubles started. When she moved here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see now that Cordy, still steamed, is 
      talking to Anya as they walk amid the usual hustle and bustle on their way 
      to class. Cordy's moving painfully - Anya notices.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>You okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Oh - I pulled some stitches 
      last<br/>night. Know why?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordelia nods across the courtyard 
      to-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY, XANDER AND WILLOW - who sit together 
      in a grassy area, doing schoolwork and talking.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Surprise! It was Buffy's 
      fault!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now HARMONY passes. Sneers.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Loved the look last night, 
      Cor.<br/>Dumpster chic for the dumped.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony flitters off and Cordy stops - 
      looking tired. Anya takes off THE PENDANT she wears and drapes it around 
      Cordy's neck.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Here. You need this more 
      than<br/>I do right now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Yeah, I could use some luck 
      -- and a<br/>big stick with pointy sharp bits. If<br/>that Buffy wasn't a 
      slayer, I swear-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>She's a pain -- but Xander's an 
      utter<br/>loser. Don't you wish --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>(interrupting)<br/>I never 
      would have looked twice at<br/>Xander if Buffy hadn't made 
      him<br/>marginally cooler by hanging with him.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anya, standing a bit before Cordy, turns to 
      look at the group.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Really...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Oh, yeah. I

      Sunnydale.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Anya turns toward Cordy - revealing that 
      her face has become a HIDEOUS DEMONIC VISAGE. Blank eyes. Skin, white and 
      veiny... She smiles - a horrible, BROWN TOOTHED, evil grin - and utters in 
      a gnarly, DEEP voice-</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy looks around, but Anya's history. 
      Cordy takes this in. Looks and sees:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: THE GRASS</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where Buffy and friends were. There is no 
      one there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then she realizes that she's not in pain 
      anymore. Checks her TORSO WHERE HER WOUND WAS. It's GONE. Totally 
      healed.</font></p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>She was, like, a good

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy moves down the hall, which is also far 
      less crowded than usual. A number of lockers stand open - and the ones 
      that are closed are draped with GARLIC and all sorts of freaky TALISMANS. 
      Also - the walls are now decorated with PROPAGANDA TYPE POSTERS that say 
      things like "DON'T BE A FOOL - RESPECT CURFEW!" and "DAYTIME DATES ARE 
      FUN!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now she walks past A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHIC 
      PORTRAIT in memoriam of PRINCIPAL FLUTIE. Below it is a PLAQUE with 
      Flutie's name and his dates of service. Then she passes one in memoriam of 
      PRINCIPAL SNYDER, and one in memoriam of PRINCIPAL JACKSON, and so it 
      goes... Each one recording a SHORTER PERIOD OF SERVICE. Cordy doesn't 
      notice the portraits - her focus instead on HARMONY and the CORDETTES, who 
      are gathered at one end of the hall. She hesitates a moment as they spot 
      her - not entirely sure what her reception will be. But the girls SQUEAL 
      with delight and run to her. They look great as usual - but they wear more 
      muted hues (still DKNY) and each sports a stylish CROSS.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Where've you been!? Ted

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>(thinks she gets it)<br/>Oh, 
      the Bronze isn't cool in this<br/>reality. Gotta make these 
      little<br/>adjustments.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony takes her aside.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Cordy, what's with you? You 
      wear<br/>this "come bite me" outfit, you make<br/>jokes about the Bronze, 
      you're acting<br/>a little skitzo.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>You're right. I'm just... 
      well you<br/>know I bumped my head yesterday and<br/>I'm just forgetting all 
      kinds of stuff.<br/>(then/conspiratorially)<br/>Not that I care, but - 
      Xander Harris<br/>is miserable, right? And that Willow<br/>freak he hangs 
      with? She's not even<br/>a blip on the radar screen - 
right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony blinks like she doesn't comprehend. 
      Finally-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>(no duh)<br/>Well - yeah. 
      They're dead.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">That's it. Harmony, exasperated, takes 
      off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OFF CORDY - stunned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - PARKING LOT - 
      DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's almost DUSK as Cordy, digging in her 
      purse for her keys, marches toward where she left her car that morning. 
      She's now pretty freaked. She reaches the parking lot and stops in her 
      tracks. Her car is gone. In fact - there are NO CARS anywhere in sight. 
      The parking lot is totally empty.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Okay. Not 
      funny!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy starts pacing - sees the caretaker 
      hustling past.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Hey! You! Where'd you put 
      my car!?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The caretaker stops. Looks at Cordy 
      quizzically.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CARETAKER<br/>Pardon?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>My auto!? El 
      convertab-lo?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The caretaker shakes his head. She's talking 
      nonsense.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CARETAKER<br/>You students aren't 
      allowed<br/>to drive and you know it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CARETAKER<br/>Go on now, miss. You 
      better get<br/>yourself inside before the sun sets.</font></center>
<p></p>

      speechless.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's just past dusk and Cordelia, now 
      officially freaked, walks quickly home. All the STORES and RESTAURANTS are 
      closed, many are boarded-up. It's like a ghost town.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">In the distance - Cordy hears a faint 
      SCREAM. She starts, takes a deep breath. Starts to RUN. Rounds a corner 
      and SLAMS right into-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who catches her - smiles. He's dressed to 
      kill in black leather pants, long dark coat... And his skin is deathly 
      pale.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Well, what do you know? 
      Cordelia Chase.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy yanks herself out of his 
      grasp.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>What is this - some kind of 
      sick<br/>joke? Harmony told me you were dead.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Now why would she say 
      something like<br/>that? Let's think...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Whatever. Just - listen to 
      me. We<br/>have to find Buffy. She'll figure<br/>out a way to save us. She 
      was<br/>supposed to be here and - as much as<br/>it kills to say it - things 
      were<br/>better when she was around-</font></center>

      Girl. Duh!<br/>Who do you think I'm talking about?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordelia is cut off as another voice rises 
      from the shadows. A GIRL'S VOICE.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GIRL (0.C.)<br/>Bored 
      now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DARK, HIGH BOOTS as they step onto the 
      sidewalk. We move up and find more leather, but these pants are girl style 
      and of the lace-up variety... We continue up, finally revealing WILLOW'S 
      sweetly beautiful face - wearing an expression that's anything but. It's 
      somehow carnivorous and child-like all at once.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>This is the part that's less 
      fun,<br/>when there isn't any screaming.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordelia, stunned anew at seeing Willow, 
      stammers-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>What - what is up with you 
      two<br/>And the leather?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow comes to Cordy, getting into her 
      personal space in a way that is both menacing and sexual.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>(stepping back)<br/>What's 
      going on?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Play now?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Xander puts his arms around Willow - 
      pulls her back, nuzzling her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Not that I don't appreciate 
      your<br/>appetite, Will... But I thought we<br/>agreed it was my 
      turn-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordelia can not believe her eyes, cuts him 
      off.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>No. No way! I wished us 
      into<br/>bizarro land and you guys are still<br/>together? I can not 
      win!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander turns his attention back to 
      Cordy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Probably not-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And with that Xander GOES VAMPY.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>But I'll give you a head 
      start.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordy SCREAMS - starts to RUN. Xander and 
      Willow watch her for a long beat. Willow smiles.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I love this 
      part.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander KISSES her hungrily - taking his 
      time. Then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You love all the 
      parts.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And he takes off after CORDY at an 
      incredible speed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON CORDY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Xander catches her and hurls her to the 
      ground. Her head hits the pavement with a sickening CRACK. She's out 
      cold.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Stands over her. Willow comes up from behind 
      - pouting.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No fun. She didn't even 
      hardly fight.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With that Xander snatches Cordy up off the 
      ground. He's about to BITE HER when he's stopped by a SCREECHING OF TIRES. 
      0Z' VAN, with 0Z as the wheel man, SQUEALS TO A HALT AT THE CURB. Xander 
      and Willow glance at each other - incredulous.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Oh swell. It's the white 
      hats.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now GILES, LARRY and a girl we've not seen 
      before, NANCY, jump out of the van. Giles holds Xander and Willow off with 
      a LARGE CROSS.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(to Larry and Nancy)<br/>I've 
      got them. Get the girl!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Larry and Nancy drag Cordy into Oz' van. As 
      soon as they are safely inside, Giles jumps in and they TAKE OFF. Xander 
      and Willow just watch, more amused than anything.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Those people need to find 
      some hobbies.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON CORDY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who lies on the table in the library -- 
      Giles' coat folded under her head. She's still out like a light. GILES 
      takes her pulse - Oz, Larry and Nancy stand nearby.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>How's she doing?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Her pulse is 
      strong.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">NANCY<br/>What was she doing wearing 
      red?<br/>Everybody knows vampires are<br/>attracted to bright 
      colors.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">LARRY<br/>That's Cordelia. It's better 
      to look<br/>good than to feel... alive.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Go watch the perimeter - in 
      case<br/>those vampires followed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Without further discussion - Oz, Larry and 
      Nancy gather weapons (including the CROSSBOW) and exit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. BRONZE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The place is hopping - but the clientele has 
      changed. It is now only VAMPIRES who move in and out of the place. We see 
      WILLOW AND XANDER go inside. They pass a VAMP as he finishes draining a 
      girl - tosses her aside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WE FOLLOW WILLOW AND XANDER THROUGH THE 
      BRONZE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There are VAMPS everywhere - representing a 
      bevy of eras... All partying. They smoke, dance... A few FEED on helpless 
      victims. On the stage we see two HANGING CAGES - inside of which huddle 
      TERRIFIED HUMANS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Xander greets a SEVENTIES LOOKING VAMP 
      who stands with a cue stick by the POOL TABLE - upon which A FRESH MALE 
      VICTIM is GAGGED AND BOUND.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(to a vamp buddy)<br/>Slap my 
      hand, dead soul man...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander and the buddy slap. Then the 70's 
      looking vamp chalks up his cue... Fortunately - we don't see what he does 
      with it. Instead, we go with Will and Xander as they pass TWO LARGE VAMP 
      GUARDS and move through some VELVET CURTAINS into-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BRONZE - PRIVATE ROOM - 
NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Bronze meets "Scar Face." Willow and 
      Xander approach a HIGH BACKED CHAIR. Someone RISES - turns to them. It's 
      THE MASTER - his mouth as "fruit punchy" as ever.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>Ahhhh. Xander. 
      Willow.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The master, irritated, reaches into the 
      chair, lifts up A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL - WHO IS BITTEN BUT STILL 
      SQUIRMING.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>Hungry? I lost my taste for 
      this<br/>one. She kept looking at me. I'm<br/>trying to eat and she looks at 
      me...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow and Xander hesitate. But Will is 
      licking her lips.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>(to Will)<br/>Go 
      on.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow MORPHS TO VAMP FACE, grabs the catch 
      - bites into her with relish. Drags her away to finish the job. The Master 
      watches her, wistful.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>I remember that lust for the 
      kill...<br/>(shrugs off the reverie/to Xander)<br/>So. Any news from the 
      street?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Had a prime kill -- an old

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>He'll be dealt with soon 
      enough.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Willow returns. Wiping the blood from

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Will and Xander now notice that the Master's 
      expression has turned GRAVE. Both Will and Xander react. Not 
      good.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>This girl spoke of summoning 
      a slayer<br/>here? Now, of all times? And you<br/>didn't kill 
      her?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well, they had crosses 
      --</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDY stirs. Starts to MOAN.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles runs from his office. Moves to her. 
      Cordy manages to focus - sees that it's Giles. Tries to talk

<p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>No! You have to get Buffy. 
      Buffy<br/>changes it. It wasn't like this. It<br/>was better. I mean, the 
      clothes<br/>alone... But people were happy -<br/>mostly - 
      and...<br/>(then)<br/>Wait. Why are you here? And she's<br/>not.. I mean, you 
      were her watcher.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(amazed)<br/>How did you know I 
      was a watcher, I never --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He stops. Turns, listening.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Thought I heard 
      something.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He moves quickly and quietly to the book 
      cage. Throws open the cabinet. There are just a few weapons left in there 
      -- he grabs a cross and a long stake.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I want you to start again and 
      explain<br/>everything very carefully.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As he turns back the door slams shut in his 
      face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow grins at him, holds up the keys. 
      Behind her, Xander holds Cordy from behind, his hand over her mouth. Both 
      of them in VAMPFACE.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You're in a big 
      cage.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

      guy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Furious, Giles SLAMS the cross up against 
      the bars of the cage. Willow starts back, growling.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>So you're a watcher, 
      huh?<br/>(smiles)<br/>Watch this.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now he sinks his teeth into Cordy's neck... 
      Her eyes go glassy with shock. Staring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON GILES</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Watching - horrified - from the cage. rips 
      it, trying to shake the door free -- but it's no use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Looks to Willow as he feeds. He NODS and she 
      LATCHES onto the other side of CORDY'S NECK. They drain her in symbiotic 
      ecstasy, Xander gripping-the back of Willow's head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow crawls on top of him - sits on his 
      back. Runs her hands through his dirty hair... Then, without warning - 
      VIOLENTLY YANKS his head back. And we see that it is ANGEL. He grunts from 
      the strain - but still says nothing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She leans down - gets in his face - LICKS 
      HIM. Then whispers...</font></p>

      Laughs.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>That's right,

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now she grabs his shirt and RIPS IT OPEN. 
      Buttons scatter. We see that Angel's chest is COVERED IN HORRIBLE 
      BLISTERING WOUNDS. Willow also notes this - hesitates.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oooh. Maybe I went too

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It flies over Willow's shoulder. Lands on 
      ANGEL'S CHEST, where it HISSES and BURNS. Angel WRITHES, trying not to 
      scream.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Anyanka raised a demon to ruin 
      her<br/>unfaithful lover. The demon did her<br/>bidding - but then cursed 
      her and<br/>turned her into a sort of...<br/>patron saint for scorned 
      women.<br/>Apparently, the cry of a wronged<br/>woman is like a siren's call 
      to Anyanka.</font></center>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I'm not sure. She said the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. PARK - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WHAT GILES SEES</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A LARGE TRUCK with a cheery sign on the side 
      that reads "SUNNYDALE LOVES RECYCLING!" is stopped on the street. And it 
      looks as if a number (five) of Sunnydale citizens are being FORCED INTO 
      the back of the truck by TWO THUGS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' CAR - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles pulls over, grabs his cross and some 
      stakes. He jumps out of the car.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. PARK - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles moves toward the truck. Sees that, 
      indeed, the thugs are VAMPS, and they are using whatever means necessary 
      to herd the protesting people into the truck. There are already a number 
      (eight) of people inside, looking cowed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Back to the truck, Giles THRUSTS HIS CROSS 
      at the vamps - grabs a few of their intended victims away from 
      them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(to the would-be 
      victims)<br/>Run!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And they do - taking off down the dark 
      street as fast as their trembling legs can carry them. Giles reaches out 
      for another helpless woman when the third VAMP LUNGES AT HIM FROM AROUND 
      THE TRUCK - bringing him to the ground. Giles' cross and stakes fly from 
      his hands and go skittering onto the pavement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The vamp comes to pick Giles up. Giles 
      hears:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">VAMP (O.S.)<br/>Put him in the 
      truck!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WITH GILES ON THE GROUND</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Much carnage, no dusting.</font></p>

      dubious.</font></p>

      live -<br/>To punish me. I kept hoping - maybe<br/>you'd come. My

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy can't believe her ears.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Is this a "get in my pants" 
      thing?<br/>You Sunnydale guys all talk like I'm<br/>the second

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>I'm... sorry. I just 
      meant-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's run out of patience.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't have time for 
      stories.<br/>Where's the Master?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>They're at his factory. It 
      starts tonight.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Factory?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>(hopeful)<br/>I - I can take 
      you there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy considers. Gives him the once over. 
      Then she KICKS the door of his cell open. She waits for him to exit but 
      he's already gone as far as his chains will allow. Exasperated - she 
      starts to break his shackles - then her CROSS swings toward him. Angel 
      instinctively BACKS OFF. Buffy observes this. Gets it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You've got to be 
      kidding.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She starts to WALK AWAY - leaving Angel

      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>You don't believe I want to 
      help you.<br/>(he opens his shirt)<br/>Believe I want him 
      dead.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks at his wounds, at his face. 
      Considers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. PEOPLE PROCESSING PLANT - MAIN AREA - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We move through a LARGE INDUSTRIAL SPACE 
      that looks very much like a MEAT PACKING PLANT.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We find the Master, who stands near a 
      CONVEYER BELT that runs the length of the room. Beside him stand WILLOW 
      and XANDER and a handful of other vamps - all decked out for a fancy 
      ceremony. They all face a CHEERING THRONG of vampires.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Off to one side of the conveyor belt we see 
      a WOODEN HOLDING PEN - where dozens of terrified PEOPLE huddle together, 
      awaiting a fate they know can only be horrible. Among them we see LARRY 
      AND OZ - who were clearly captured while on patrol.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Master, jubilant, is addressing the 
      assembled crowd.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>(mid-speech)<br/>Vampires! 
      Undeniably, we are the<br/>world's superior race. Yet we have<br/>always 
      been too parochial. Too bound<br/>to the mindless routine of 
      the<br/>predator. Hunt and kill... Hunt and<br/>kill... Titillating? 
      Yes.<br/>Practical? Hardly... Meanwhile -the<br/>humans, with their 
      plebeian<br/>minds, have brought us a truly<br/>demonic concept: Mass 
      production.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. PEOPLE PROCESSING PLANT - ANOTHER AREA 
      - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY, crossbow discreetly at her side, and 
      ANGEL hide behind a refrigeration unit, listening to the Master's 
      oratory.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>What's the 
      plan?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy hands him a stake.</font></p>

      this.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. PEOPLE PROCESSING PLANT - MAIN AREA - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Master continues his speech.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>The days of compromise, of 
      living<br/>alongside the humans, are over. It's<br/>time to take them out. 
      Time to treat<br/>them like... well, let's not mince<br/>words here -- like 
      the cattle they are!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The crowd CHEERS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: XANDER AND WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">At the Master's right hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(moved)<br/>We really are 
      living in a golden age.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles' dining table is littered with various 
      mystical items, crystals, sage roots, etc... He's got a text in front of 
      him and he's nervously making his way through a SUMMONING 
      RITUAL.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Anyanka, I beseech thee, 
      uh...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He looks back at the text. Finds his place 
      again.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>In the name of all women 
      scorned -<br/>come before me!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He lights a mixture of herbs in a chalice. 
      Waits. Nothing seems to happen. Then, from the shadows, steps the girl we 
      knew as ANYA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">However, her face is still HORRIBLE - the 
      demonic visage we saw at the end of act one.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYANKA<br/>DO you have any idea what I 
      do to a<br/>man who uses that spell to summon me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OFF GILES</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Both triumphant at his success and terrified 
      of her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. PEOPLE PROCESSING PLANT - MAIN AREA - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>Bring the 
      first!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Master nods to one of his henchmen - who 
      GRABS A SCREAMING GIRL from the holding pen. Then he STUNS her with a 
      CATTLE PROD TYPE DEVICE and straps her to the CONVEYER BELT.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>(gleeful)<br/>She's still 
      alive here, see?<br/>For freshness.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now the conveyer belt moves the WILD EYED 
      GIRL into an open chamber.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL AND BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Move unnoticed through the crowd. Everyone 
      is too rapt by the spectacle of the machine to pay attention to them. They 
      separate - Buffy heading for the center of the room, Angel moving to the 
      PEN WHERE THE HUMANS ARE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON THE KILLING MACHINE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where a PLASTIC TUBING system fills with 
      BLOOD, sending it into a LARGE CONTAINER.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON THE VICTIM</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Whose eyes flutter - and go dead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A HENCHMAN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Opens a tap in the killing machine. Fills a 
      WINE GLASS full of blood and delivers it to-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE MASTER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who moves up onto a PLATFORM at the end of 
      the plant. He raises his glass to the gathered crowd in a toast, 
      ecstatic.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MASTER<br/>Welcome to the 
      future!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">STANDS amidst the crowd - Shoulders the 
      crossbow and aims it at the Master. She shoots.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE MASTER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SEES THIS and YANKS XANDER in front of him. 
      Xander takes the arrow in the shoulder.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON ANGEL AND THE CATTLE PEN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Angel frees the humans. Many scatter - 
      but OZ, LARRY and a few BRAVE SOULS break wood from the pen and GO AFTER 
      THEIR CAPTORS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE (ALSO KNOWN AS THE ONE 
      BIG MASTER SHOT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As VAMPS and HUMANS go at it 
      everywhere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER AND WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He tugs at the arrow as she sees 
      ANGEL.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(re: Angel)<br/>Uh oh. Puppy 
      got out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With that, she SPRINTS TO JOIN THE 
      FIGHT.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anyanka circles slowly towards Giles, who 
      counters.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Cordelia Chase. What did she 
      wish for?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYANKA<br/>(smiling)<br/>I had no idea 
      her wish would be so...<br/>exciting. A brave new world. I hope<br/>she 
      likes it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>She's dead.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYANKA<br/>It happens.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>You're going to change it 
      back.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She moves toward him more directly, but he 
      stands his ground.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I'm not afraid of you. Your 
      only<br/>power lies in the wishing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She grabs him by the throat in a vice-like 
      grip.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYANKA<br/>Wrong.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. PEOPLE PROCESSING PLANT - MAIN AREA - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy is throwing a vamp off her as Xander 
      approaches, pulling the arrow from his shoulder. He looks truly pissed -- 
      moves to stab Buffy with it as she is preoccupied with yet another 
      vamp.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Sees this. Throws himself between Xander and 
      Buffy. He punches Xander, sending him sprawling. Turns to 
Buffy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">That's when they see the STAKE Xander 
      plunged into Angel's chest. There is a heartbeat before he turns to 
      dust.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>Buffy-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And he's gone. Buffy registers this with NO 
      FEELING. She simply STEPS THROUGH ANGEL'S DUST to get to Xander and 
      continue the fight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She trades blows with Xander and another 
      henchman, her eyes completely empty. As she pounds away - the picture goes 
      to SLOW MOTION</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anyanka still holds Giles in her iron 
      grasp.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYANKA<br/>This is the real world now. 
      There's<br/>no going back. This is the world we made.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Choking, he looks at her and 
sees:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON: HER NECKLACE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Identical to Cordy's. It GLOWS with 
      power.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYANKA<br/>Isn't it 
      wonderful?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. PEOPLE PROCESSING PLANT - MAIN AREA - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Haunting classical music is the only sound 
      we hear as the mayhem continues in full-on (thank you, Mr. Peckinpah), 
      SLOW MOTION GLORY.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she knocks a henchman off his feet. Then 
      spins and STAKES XANDER. He's SLOW MOTION DUST.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE DOORS TO THE PLANT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As two or three humans from the pen POUND at 
      the EXIT - desperate to get out. But they are descended on by 
      VAMPS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who SPINS to continue the fight. Encounters 
      the MASTER. He pounds her in the face - but she doesn't fall. She gives as 
      good as she gets. They go at it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who moves to help the Master. Doesn't notice 
      Oz until it's too late... OZ SLAMS HER INTO A JAGGED PIECE OF BROKEN WOOD 
      that juts from the battered holding pen. She's history.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles stops clawing at her iron grip and 
      SNATCHES her PENDANT off her neck. This action produces genuine TERROR in 
      Anya's face. She lets go briefly, and he stumbles back.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYANKA<br/>No!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She flies at him -- and he DECKS her, sends 
      her flying back into a corner. She looks up as he puts the pendant on the 
      table and grabs some desktop object that can be used as a 
      mallet.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYANKA<br/>Trusting fool! How do you 
      know the<br/>other world is any better than this?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(almost to himself)<br/>Because 
      it has to be.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He swings the mallet -- (Slo mo?)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON THE PENDANT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As it shatters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. PEOPLE PROCESSING PLANT - MAIN AREA - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY AND THE MASTER - STILL IN SLOW 
      MOTION</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The floor of the plant is littered with 
      corpses. The Master has Buffy off her feet. He SNAPS her neck. Buffy falls 
      from his grasp - EYES EMPTY AND STARING. Her death goes unnoticed amidst 
      the rest of the fighting, which continues. She's just another body about 
      to hit the ground when-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE SCREEN GOES WHITE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SCHOOL - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We're back in the EXACT SAME SCENE from the 
      end of ACT ONE where Cordelia made her wish. Sunnydale high is back to 
      it's POPULATED, COLORFUL self... Just as before - Cordelia speaks to 
      ANYA.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>I wish Buffy Summers had 
      never<br/>Come to Sunnydale...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Anya turns toward Cordy - BUT THIS TIME 
      HER FACE DOESN'T CHANGE. She still looks like regular old Anya. Still -

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Done.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Nothing happens. Anya looks deeply

      cool.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cordelia moves off - musing.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>No wait - I wish Buffy 
      Summers<br/>Was never born.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Okay... Anya tries again.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Done!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Nothing. Anya looks like she could pull her 
      hair out. Cordy, oblivious, keeps chattering...</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>And I wish Xander Harris 
      never again<br/>knows the touch of a woman. And that<br/>Willow wakes up 
      tomorrow covered in<br/>monkey hair.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We watch them MOVE OFF INTO THE DISTANCE as 
      Anya follows after her - clearly FRUSTRATED BEYOND MEASURE.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>In fact - I wish all men -
