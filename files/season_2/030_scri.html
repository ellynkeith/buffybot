<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
      <p>Another CREEPY NIGHT among the tombstones. 
      <p>We PAN along the cemetery wall and TILT UP. A HAND comes over the top. 
      A beat. Then ANOTHER HAND comes over. BUFEY hoists herself into view. She 
      rests for a moment. Her face is pale, her eyes sunken, her hair mussed up 
      -- not the bright and shiny Buffy we're accustomed to seeing. 
      <p>Buffy wearily SWINGS her leg over the wall. With great effort, she 
      PULLS the rest of her body over, then DROPS to the ground, STUMBLING a 
      bit. She puts a hand against the wall and steadies herself, feeling DIZZY. 

      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Whoa...</center>
<p>She pulls a stake from her bag and begins to MOVE along the wall, 
      scoping out the place. 
      <p>She HEARS someone near the gate and PRESSES herself against the wall, 
      inching towards the sound. She lifts her stake, STEPS around the corner, 
      and nearly PLUNGES her stake into-- 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>DYEAAH!</center>
<p>--who JUMPS away, startled. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Non-vampire.</center>
<p>Buffy sees WILLOW and CORDELIA behind him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Plus two. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(meekly)<br/>Hi. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(composing himself)<br/>Man, Buffy. My whole life 
      just<br/>flashed before my eyes.<br/>(then)<br/>I've got to get me a 
      life.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy puts the stake back in her belt. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>What are <u>you</u> doing here? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What are you doing here? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Patrolling. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Buffy, you're sick. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I feel fine. The ground's moving<br/>around a little bit, but I 
      like it.<br/>It's like a ride. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Half the school is out with this flu,<br/>Buffy. It's a 
      serious deal. We're<br/>all worried about how gross you look. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm touched. I have work to do. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Come on, Buffy. One night of rest<br/>isn't going to kill you. 

      <p>BUFFY<br/>But it might kill someone else. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You mean Angel might.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks at them for a moment, then: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You guys should go find a safer place<br/>to be. Like 
      somewhere I'm not. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Buffy, this isn't the time to<br/>challenge Angel for the 
      Ultimate<br/>Fighting Championship. He's at full<br/>strength, and you're 
      only half a<br/>slayer. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But I'm still the Slayer. And as<br/>long as I am, Angel's not 
      going to<br/>kill anyone else.</p></p></center>
<p>From behind her, she hears: 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL (O.S.)<br/>Oh, come on. Just one more.</center>
<p>Buffy turns to see ANGEL. All vamped out. 
      <p>He LUNGES at the trio. They SCATTER, but Angel DIVES and grabs 
      Cordelia, who FALLS to the ground, screaming. 
      <p>Buffy GRABS Angel and LIFTS him to face her (as Cordelia SCAMPERS 
      away). Buffy has a stake in her right hand, raised and ready to plunge. 
      <p>She starts to bring the stake down. Angel CATCHES her wrist and BENDS 
      her hand backwards-- 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(pained)<br/>Ahh!</center>
<p>--until she drops the stake. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>Not feeling well, lover?</center>
<p>Buffy surprises him with a LEFT HOOK out of nowhere. He reels a bit. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>That helps.</center>
<p>Angel RAMS his shoulder into her chest and SLAMS her against a 
      gravestone, knocking the wind out of her. 
      <p>BUFFY'S POV: is blurry. 
      <p>She sluggishly tries to hold Angel off, but he staggers her with a 
      series of HITS and KICKS. 
      <p>Buffy stumbles away and tries to focus on Angel. She SWINGS at him a 
      few times, misses. 
      <p>An amused Angel watches her struggle. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>You know, you being off your game?<br/>It's kind of taking 
      all the fun out<br/>of this.</center>
<p>He smashes his FIST into her face. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL (cont'd)<br/>Nope. Still fun.</center>
<p>He JUMPS on her and they ROLL on the ground until he is on top of her. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL (cont'd)<br/>Uh-oh. This does not look good for<br/>our 
      heroine.</center>
<p>Suddenly, Buffy's weapons bag is PULLED over Angel's head, blinding 
      him. 
      <p>REVEAL: Willow standing behind him, holding the bag on. 
      <p>Xander sends a couple of PUNCHES to Angel's torso. Angel ROLLS off of 
      Buffy, RIPS the bag off his head and turns to face Willow, Xander and 
      Cordelia. 
      <p>They stand there between him and Buffy, each holding a cross. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL (cont'd)<br/>We'll have to do this again some time.</center>
<p>Angel TURNS and HEADS OEF. 
      <p>Buffy struggles to her feet; puts her hand to her head. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I told you guys to leave.<br/>(a beat)<br/>This is my 
      fight. You don't have<br/>to...</center>
<p>Her eyes ROLL BACK in her head and she COLLAPSES. Xander quickly moves 
      down to her. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Buffy, are you all right?</center>
<p>She doesn't respond. He takes her by the shoulders. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Buffy?</center>
<p>CLOSE ON: 
      <p>Buffy's lifeless body.

      <p>A cold, antiseptic, dreary place. Eerily silent. PATIENTS in various

      <p>The calm is shattered as Xander BURSTS through the hospital doors, 
      carrying Buffy. Willow and Cordelia run alongside. 
      <p>

<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>The flu, fainted and fell. 
      She's<br/><u>sick</u>! Make it better!</center>
<p>Buffy is placed on a gurney and WHEELED down the hall as the INTERN 
      begins to examine her. Buffy's friends crowd around. 
      <p>
<center>INTERN<br/>The patient is unconscious.<br/>(examining 
      eyes)<br/>Pupils are unequal and unresponsive. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>What does that mean? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Is she going to be okay? 
      <p>INTERN<br/>People, you need to give us some<br/>room, here!</p></p></p></center>
<p>Still on the move, they meet up with another doctor, a woman in her 
      mid-thirties. This is DR. WILKINSON. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>What've we got? 
      <p>INTERN<br/>Teenage girl, high-grade fever,<br/>possible fractures. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Get her into Trauma One. Give me a<br/>CBC, chem 7, 
      type and screen.</p></p></center>
<p>They wheel her into a room. Xander and the girls start to follow them 
      in. Dr. Wilkinson stops them. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON (cont'd)<br/>Excuse me, you're going to have 
      to<br/>wait out here. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Someone should be with her. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>You're going to have to wait out here.</p></p></center>
<p>Dr. Wilkinson hurries inside, swinging the door closed. Willow turns to 
      Xander. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I'll call Giles. Tell him what<br/>happened.<br/>(then, to 
      Cordelia)<br/>Call Buffy's mom. Tell her... not<br/>what happened. Just get 
      her here.</center>
<p>The girls go off as Xander looks through a window, into the emergency 
      room. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(trying to believe it)<br/>She's going to be 
      okay.</center>
<p>XANDER'S POV through the window: 
      <p>as the Slayer lies near death. Doctors and nurses surround her in a 
      flurry of activity. 
      <p>DISSOLVE TO: 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - LATER (NIGHT) 
      <p>GILES is there with Xander, Willow, and Cordelia as JOYCE comes rushing 
      in. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Where is she? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Still in the emergency room. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>I want to see her. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>They won't let us in.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Dr. Wilkinson comes over. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Ms. Summers? I'm Dr. Wilkinson. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Is Buffy okay? 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>We were able to stabilize-- 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Is she <u>okay</u>? 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>She's going to be fine.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Joyce lets out a breath. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Thank you. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Good. Good. That's good. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>I want to keep her here a few days,<br/>though. She's 
      still got some healing<br/>to do. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Was she hurt badly? 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>The injuries from the fall were<br/>minor: Sprained 
      wrist and a couple of<br/>cracked ribs. I'm more concerned<br/>about her 
      fever. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>She said this morning she was feeling<br/>better. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>She will be. But she's still<br/>suffering from 
      exhaustion and<br/>dehydration. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I keep telling her that Yoo-Hoo is<br/>not a fluid 
      replenisher. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Come on. I'm sure you want to see<br/>her.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER (NIGHT) 
      <p>Buffy is wheeled on a gurney out of the ER and into the hallway, where 
      Joyce and the others wait. Her sprained wrist (from the Angel encounter) 
      is wrapped with a bandage, and because of her fever she's a little less 
      than coherent. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Buffy? Hi, sweetheart. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Hey, Buffy. We're all here. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(slurring her words)<br/>Heyyy... here were are. It's all 
      of<br/>we! Are we taking me home?</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy tries to sit up. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Buffy, you need to lie down. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(protesting weakly)<br/>Yes, lie at home. My bed is 
      better<br/>than any bed that's not my bed. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>(to the others)<br/>She's still a little out of it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Shhh! Hospital zone. No singing.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Dr. Wilkinson gently pushes Buffy back down. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>She'll feel better after she's been<br/>here a 
      while.</center>
<p>Buffy, suddenly sober, begins struggling with the covers. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>No. Let me go. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Buffy, what's wrong? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(fighting more)<br/>Let me go! 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I think she wants to go. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>(calling out)<br/>I need some assistance!</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>A FEW NURSES rush over and help subdue Buffy, who is in major freak 
      mode. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Giles, tell them. The vampires.<br/>I've got to kill the 
      vampires! 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Vampires?</p></center>
<p>Dr. Wilkinson prepares a syringe. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>She's been like this since she came<br/>in. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(covering)<br/>Probably the fever? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah. It's made her delusional. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(frantic)<br/>They're out there!</p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles laughs nervously. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>It's okay, Buffy. We'll get those<br/>vampires some other 
      time!<br/>(off Joyce's look)<br/>I hear it's best to just go along. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>This will help her relax.</p></center>
<p>The nurses hold Buffy down as Dr. Wilkinson gives her a shot. Joyce 
      leans down to her daughter. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Honey...? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(frail)<br/>I want to go home. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>(taking her hand)<br/>Everything's going to be okay. 
      I<br/>promise.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy STARES up from the gurney as her eyes get heavy from the 
      sedative. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(fights to stay awake)<br/>Please don't make me stay. Not 
      here.</center>
<p>Buffy is wheeled into a room as the gang waits in the hall. They watch 
      Buffy through the window. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>That was a new experience. I'm not<br/>used to seeing 
      Buffy scared like that. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>She just hates hospitals. Since she<br/>was a little girl. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What happened? 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>(tentatively)<br/>When Buffy was eight... her cousin,<br/>Celia, 
      died in a hospital.<br/>(a beat)<br/>Buffy was alone with her when 
      it<br/>happened. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(sadly)<br/>Yuck. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>They were very close. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>And she was eight? 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>She doesn't talk about it, but... she<br/>just doesn't like 
      hospitals. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Can't say as I blame.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She stares in at Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Looks like she's asleep. I should go<br/>call her father. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I think there's a phone...</p></center>
<p>Joyce goes off with Giles. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Thank you for coming. I really<br/>appreciate the way you 
      look out for<br/>her. All of you. 
      <p>GILES<br/>We're very fond of her. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>(pauses, gathering)<br/>I hope I'm not out of line, but 
      I<br/>just wanted to say how sorry I am<br/>about that teacher, Ms. 
      Calendar.<br/>Buffy said you were close. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Thank you. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Buffy's been so down since it<br/>happened. She <u>never</u> 
      gets sick. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I'm sure she'll be fine. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>I'm sorry, I babble when I'm nervous.<br/>I just wanted to -- 
      well, if you need<br/>anything.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>ANGLE: THE OTHERS 
      <p>Looking into Buffy's room. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>You think she'll be okay in here? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I don't know... Lysette got her nose<br/>done here, you 
      know; she asked for<br/>the Gwyneth Paltrow but it looked<br/>more like the 
      Mr. Potato Head -- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Cordy. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Buffy's not here for cosmetic surgery. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>No, but while she's here she could<br/>get that thing taken 
      care of. That<br/>thing on her face -- you know, that<br/><u>thing</u>. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Do you think Angel would attack her<br/>in here? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>He can come in. It's a public<br/>building. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That's true...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They start off. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Am I the only one who's noticed 
that<br/>thing?</center>
<p>CAMERA MOVES IN ON BUFFY and we: 
      <p>MATCH DISSOLVE TO: 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
      <p>An IV DRIP courses through a tube connected to Buffy's arm. She TOSSES 
      and TURNS, sleeping fitfully. She MOANS occasionally, drifting in and out 
      of consciousness. 
      <p>She OPENS HER EYES with a start and sees a little boy standing in the 
      doorway, staring at her. His name is RYAN. He's still, expressionless, 
      Stepfordian. Think Christopher Walken at age ten. 
      <p>He walks away. 
      <p>Suddenly, a MYSTERIOUS FIGURE passes by the door, following the boy. 
      The figure is tall, not quite human, dressed in dark clothes -- like an 
      eighteenth-century undertaker. 
      <p>In the dark, Buffy barely registers the figure's GHASTLY WHITE FACE, 
      BEAK-LIKE NOSE, HAIRLESS HEAD, and UGLY RED- RIMMED EYES. 
      <p>And just as quickly as the figure appeared, it's GONE. Buffy gets out 
      of bed, UNHOOKS the IV, and heads out the door. 
      <p>FLASH TO: 
      <p>INT. DIFFERENT HOSPITAL - NINE YEARS AGO (NIGHT) 
      <p>HAZY DREAM-CAM: 
      <p>An EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL (who looks as much like an eight-year- old Sarah 
      as Marcia can find) comes out of a room. This is LITTLE BUFFY. She slowly 
      and tentatively walks down the middle of a HARSHLY LIT hospital corridor. 
      MOANS ECHO throughout the hall as Little Buffy looks around. 
      <p>FROM HER POV, everything seems heightened and menacing -- shapes are 
      distorted, voices are muffled, etc. 
      <p>Little Buffy passes by various things in the hallway: an EMPTY 
      WHEELCHAIR... a cart on which sits a TRAY of SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS... a 
      defibrillator 'CRASH CART'.... 
      <p>She PEERS INTO A ROOM and sees a CURTAIN pulled around a bed. Little 
      Buffy cautiously heads into the room... 
      <p>INT. DIFFERENT HOSP. ROOM - CONT. (NINE YEARS AGO; NIGHT) 
      <p>... and walks toward the curtain. She nervously REACHES to pull it 
      away. When she TOUCHES it-- 
      <p>A FLASH fills the screen and we are back in: 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT DAY) 
      <p>BUFFY WAKES UP in her hospital bed. The room is dark. She looks around, 
      disoriented, getting her bearings. The clock next to her bed reads 2:27 
      AM. 
      <p>She SITS UP and feels something tug at her arm. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Ow...</center>
<p>She looks to see that the IV is still connected. 
      <p>The FAINT SOUND of CHILDREN CRYING can be heard from down the hall. The 
      sound only adds to Buffy's visible despair. 
      <p>She unhooks the IV from her arm, throws her covers off, and gets out of 
      bed. She STEADIES herself on the bed rail, takes a breath, and heads into 
      the hallway. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 
      <p>The hospital is eerily deserted. 
      <p>Buffy makes her way down the hall. She looks into rooms and sees 
      PATIENTS lying in beds, hooked up to monitors, ventilators at work, etc. 
      <p>A SECURITY GUARD (DON: more on him later) skulks around, watching her. 
      Buffy turns down another hallway, following the sounds of the crying. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CONT. (NIGHT) 
      <p>As Buffy rounds a corner, she sees a couple of ORDERLIES wheeling a 
      gurney into the hallway. On the gurney is a SMALL, SHEET-COVERED BODY. 
      <p>She goes to a door and looks inside. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL KIDS' WARD - CONT. (NIGHT) 
      <p>This is the kids' ward -- a half dozen or so beds and a dreary 
      collection of medical equipment. Second-hand stuffed animals and faded 
      posters of clowns are supposed to add life to the depressing room. 
      <p>A few of the CHILDREN sleep restlessly as machines monitor their 
      conditions. 
      <p>Dr. Wilkinson is arguing with another doctor (DR. STANLEY BACKER), an 
      elderly man with disheveled hair and a manner that's just a bit 
      off-kilter. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>I'm just saying step back the dosage<br/>until we 
      can analyze the results. 
      <p>DR. BACKER<br/>There isn't time. I would think that<br/>would be clear by 
      now. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>The normal course of treatment -- 
      <p>DR. BACKER<br/>They aren't responding to the normal<br/>course of 
      treatment. They're getting<br/>worse.</p></p></p></center>
<p>As they talk, he takes a hypo of fluid, injects it into a child's IV. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Raising their temperatures is<br/>potentially -- 
      <p>DR. BACKER<br/>Dr. Wilkinson, I have the parents'<br/>consent. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>They're desperate. They don't<br/>understand what 
      you're doing. 
      <p>DR. BACKER<br/>If you have a problem with my<br/>methods, bring it up 
      with the board. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>I have.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy backs away and BUMPS into someone. 
      <p>Ryan, the Christopher Walken boy, stands there, holding the hand of a 
      LITTLE GIRL. 
      <p>
<center>RYAN<br/>He comes at night. The grown-ups<br/>don't see 
him.</center>
<p>Buffy looks at Ryan, confused. 
      <p>
<center>RYAN (cont'd)<br/>He was with Tina. He'll come back<br/>for us. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Who? 
      <p>RYAN<br/>Death.</p></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL ENTRANCE AREA - 
      NIGHT 
      <p>The middle of the night. Not too many people. A NURSE or two. Maybe a 
      JANITOR. A couple of COPS talk to an apparent ASSAULT VICTIM who holds an 
      ice pack to his head. 
      <p>ANGLE: A BOUQUET OF FLOWERS 
      <p>as someone enters from the outside carrying them. 
      <p>It's Angel. He saunters past the reception desk -- only to have Xander 
      step in his path. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Visiting hours are over. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Well, I'm pretty much family. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Why don't you come back during the<br/>day... Or, gee, no. I 
      guess you<br/>can't. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>If I decide to walk into Buffy's room<br/>do you think for one 
      microsecond that<br/>you could stop me? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Maybe not. Maybe that security guard<br/>couldn't either -- or 
      those cops. Or<br/>all the orderlies... I'm kind of<br/>curious to find out. 
      You game? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Buffy's white knight. You still love<br/>her. It must just eat 
      you up that I<br/>got there first.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander clenches his jaw against the truth of it. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>You're gonna die. I'm gonna be there.</center>
<p>Angel smiles, hands Xander the flowers. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>Tell her I stopped by.</center>
<p>He exits, Xander suddenly shaky with released fear and tension. 
      <p>DISSOLVE TO: 
      <p>INT. BEDROOM - NINE YEARS AGO (NIGHT) 
      <p>CLOSE-ON: 
      <p>The face of an eight-year-old girl (CELIA), who WHIMPERS and CRIES OUT 
      in distress. 
      <p>
<center>CELIA<br/>Help me... Help!</center>
<p>PULL BACK to see that the girl is underneath a pile of PILLOWS and we 
      are in a little girl's bedroom. The girl is play-acting. 
      <p>
<center>CELIA (cont'd)<br/>Avalanche! Help! Help! I'm trapped!</center>
<p>Little Buffy appears in the doorway, hands on her hips. A bedspread 
      serves as a makeshift cape. 
      <p>
<center>LITTLE BUFFY<br/>Power Girl to the rescue!</center>
<p>Little Buffy runs over and, with 'superhuman strength,' lifts the huge 
      'boulders' off of Celia. 
      <p>
<center>CELIA<br/>You saved me! Thank you, Power Girl! 
      <p>LITTLE BUFFY<br/>You're safe now.</p></center>
<p>A FLASH fills the screen and we are in: 
      <p>INT. DIFFERENT HOSPITAL ROOM - NINE YEARS AGO (NIGHT) 
      <p>HAZY DREAM-CAM: 
      <p>As before -- Little Buffy PULLS the curtain aside, glimpsing the small 
      FEET, then LEGS and BODY of a child lying in bed. Another FLASH and we: 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY (PRESENT DAY) 
      <p>Buffy WAKES with a start. Dr. Wilkinson stares down at her. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Good morning. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Coulda fooled me... 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>How are you feeling?<br/>(off chart)<br/>Looks like your 
      fever is down. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(rising)<br/>Well, good. Thanks for having me and<br/>let's try 
      to keep in touch. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Not so fast.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She pushes Buffy gently back down, checking her arm. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON (cont'd)<br/>Hmmm. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Good Hmmm or bad Hmmm? 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Swelling is down... Swelling is gone.<br/>Does that 
      hurt? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Nope. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Amazing... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So I should go. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Soon. We want to make sure that<br/>fever's gone. It's 
      a strong virus.<br/>Not as strong as <u>you</u>, maybe... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Is that what Tina had?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Dr. Wilkinson looks down. Before she can answer, Giles, Willow, Xander 
      and Cordelia enter. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>May we come in? 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Please. See if you can keep our<br/>patient from 
      bolting.<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Rest.</p></center>
<p>Dr. Wilkinson heads out as Giles, Xander, Willow, and Cordelia come in. 
      Xander presents a balloon bouquet to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Flowers for m'lady? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>These are balloons. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Stick 'em in water, maybe they'll<br/>grow. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>And, not to be outdone--</p></p></p></center>
<p>She grandly presents Buffy with a pile of: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Homework. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Just my way of saying 'Get Well Soon.' 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You know, chocolate says that even<br/>better. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I did all of your assignments. All<br/>you have to do is sign 
      your name. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(awestruck)<br/>Chocolate means nothing to me.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Cordelia fidgets. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Nobody told me we were supposed to<br/>bring gifts. I 
      was out of the loop<br/>on gifts. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, it's traditional among...<br/>people.<br/>(to 
      Buffy)<br/>Did you pass the night well enough? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, not really. Some stuff<br/>happened, I'm 
      wondering...</p></p></center>
<p>She looks into the crowded hall. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Let's take a walk.</center>
<p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>EXT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL COURTYARD - DAY 
      <p>Willow pushes Buffy in a wheelchair as the gang walks along. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Now this part I could get used to. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You want me to go real fast?<br/>(off Giles' look)<br/>Not that 
      I would... 
      <p>GILES<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>You were discussing 'stuff'? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Stuff, yeah. You know a girl died<br/>here last night. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>How? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, that flu. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Flu? Doesn't exactly sound<br/>monsterrific. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, there's this Dr. Backer, he's<br/>been giving them 
      experimental<br/>treatments -- he's kinda creepy --<br/>I'm not sure what 
      he's up to. And<br/>then I met this kid, Ryan. He said<br/>he saw something. 

      <p>GILES<br/>Saw what? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Death. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Death? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/><u>The</u> Death? As in, 'it is your time?' 
      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy, a frightened child -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But I thought I saw something -- I<br/>was out of it, I'm not 
      sure, but. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>But you do know it was death? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Did he have an hourglass? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>If he asks you to play chess, don't<br/>even do it. Guy's like 
      a <u>whiz</u>. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Look, maybe it wasn't death.<br/>(pointedly)<br/>Maybe it was 
      something else. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Okay, so this isn't about that you're<br/>afraid of 
      hospitals cause your little<br/>friend died and you wanna conjure up<br/>a 
      monster that you can fight and save<br/>everybody and not feel helpless? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Cordelia, have you ever actually<br/><u>heard</u> of tact? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Tact is just not saying true stuff.<br/>I'll pass. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Your mom did tell us about your<br/>cousin... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>This has nothing to do with that.<br/>This kid Ryan was afraid 
      of<br/>something. Something real. As long<br/>as I'm forced to stay here, I 
      wanna<br/>find out what. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Is this the place where we say, 'What<br/>can we do to 
      help?'</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSP. RECORDS ROOM - A WHILE LATER (DAY) 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>You had to ask that, didn't you?</center>
<p>Cordelia and Xander have opened the door to a medium-sized room. File 
      cabinets line every wall. On the front of the door: 'MEDICAL RECORDS ROOM 
      - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.' 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>It'll be cake. We find out exactly<br/>how this little 
      girl Tina died, we<br/>get out. Five minutes, tops. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>This is what happens when you try to<br/>be compassionate 
      toward sick people.<br/>They take advantage of you. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Mm-hmm. Buffy almost died just so<br/>she could put you out. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I didn't want to be the first one to<br/>say it. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(pointing)<br/>Me here, you there. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Right.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander checks one side of the room as Cordelia goes to a row of file 
      cabinets. She scans the cabinets, then reaches for a drawer. A HAND GRABS 
      hers. She screams. A goofy, yet menacing-looking security guard (Don, the 
      guard Buffy saw in the hallway) stands there. 
      <p>
<center>DON<br/>What are you doing here?</center>
<p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
      <p>Giles and Willow come through the doors. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Okay, where do we start? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Hmm? Oh, I don't know. Maybe look<br/>into the history of the 
      hospital,<br/>bizarre incidents, that sort of thing. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm sensing less than full committal<br/>here. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, I suppose... Cordelia may be<br/>Homerically Insensitive, 
      but she may<br/>also be right. Disease and death are<br/>things -- possibly 
      the only things--<br/>that Buffy cannot fight.<br/>It would be natural for 
      her to try to<br/>create a defeatable opponent.<br/>Especially now, after... 
      after Jenny. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That's true. But, on the we-live-on-<br/>the-Hellmouth side, 
      these kids might<br/>have seen a monster. 
      <p>GILES<br/>That no grown-up can see. Doesn't<br/>ring a bell. Unless... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Unless? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Sometimes small children do see<br/>something we adults don't. 
      Us. Our<br/>true selves. Our hidden faces. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>So the kids might be afraid of a<br/>regular person. Like the 
      weird<br/>doctor. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Stanley Backer was the name, no? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(turns to the<br/>computer)<br/>Let's look him up.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL RECORDS ROOM - SAME TIME (DAY) 
      <p>Cordelia stares 'admiringly' at Don as he brags to her. 
      <p>
<center>DON<br/>You know, people always think<br/>security guards are just 
      guys that<br/>failed the police exam. That's not<br/>me -- this is my 
      <u>career</u>. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Stereotypes are so unfair. 
      <p>DON<br/>I did take the fireman exam, though.<br/>I didn't do so good. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I think security guards are way<br/>sexier than firemen. 
      They're all so<br/>sooty. 
      <p>DON<br/>This is where the action is, anyhow.<br/>I'm all the time 
      restraining people. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Ooh, how thrilling. Do you get<br/>scared? 
      <p>DON<br/>'Fear is for the weak.' That's my<br/>motto. Well, either that or 
      'Live in<br/>the now.' I haven't decided yet. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I bet you see a lot of tragedy, too.<br/>Like that little 
      girl... 
      <p>DON<br/>One of Dr. Backer's patients. Dr.<br/>Backer's a great man. He 
      understands<br/>the real truth about children. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>What's that? 
      <p>DON<br/>Sometimes they die.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Cordy tries to hide her expression. Don's haughty schoolboy bravado is 
      suddenly laced with creepy. 
      <p>Xander moves away from the cabinet and accidentally KICKS a drawer. Don 
      looks up and whips out his BILLY CLUB. 
      <p>
<center>DON (cont'd)<br/>What was that? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I didn't hear anything.</p></center>
<p>Don holds his hand out to quiet her. Cordelia TENSES. Xander is about 
      to be busted, when Cordelia blurts out: 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd)<br/>You have got the most perfect nose I<br/>have 
      ever seen.</center>
<p>Don turns back. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd)<br/>You must work out.</center>
<p>Behind Don, Xander WAVES a file at Cordelia, and escapes out the open 
      door. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS (DAY) 
      <p>Xander comes out of the records room and stands in the hallway, 
      flipping through the file. After a few seconds, Cordelia comes out. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Could you make just a little more<br/>with the 
      touchy-gropey? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Jealous? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Of Rogain boy? I don't think so.<br/>(hands her the 
      file)<br/>Take this to Giles, okay? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>What about you? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I'm staying here. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Oh, right, your obsession with<br/>protecting Buffy. Have I 
      ever told<br/>you how attractive that's not? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Cordelia, someone's gotta watch her<br/>back. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Yeah, I've seen you watch her 'back.' 
      <p>XANDER<br/>What's that supposed to mean? COR
      <p>DELIA<br/>(calmly explains)<br/>I was using the phrase 'watch 
      her<br/>back' as a euphemism for looking at<br/>her butt. Sort of a pun. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Oh. Right. <u>Hey</u>! 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(angry again)<br/>Well, you do! 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Jealous? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Fine. Watch <u>my</u> back.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>As she turns it on him and storms out. He watches her go, irked -- his 
      eyes drift down for a moment, appreciative -- then back up, irked. 
      <p>INT. LIBRARY - LATER THAT NIGHT 
      <p>Willow and Giles are looking at the computer. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>The good Doctor Backer has something<br/>of a rap sheet. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(off computer)<br/>Reprimands for 
      controversial<br/>experiments, risky procedures -- a<br/>malpractice suit... 
      looks like it was<br/>dropped suddenly. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Factor in Buffy's observation that<br/>he, uh, gives her the 
      wiggins... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>This could be our death guy? 
      <p>GILES<br/>I just wish I knew what he was doing<br/>to these 
      children.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: 
      <p>INT. DR. BACKER'S OFFICE - LATER (NIGHT) 
      <p>A dark office with degrees on the wall, shelves of medical books, a 
      small refrigerator, etc. 
      <p>Dr. Backer pores over a number of reports. He OPENS the refrigerator 
      and pulls out a couple of VIALS marked with different colored labels. He 
      SCRIBBLES something on one of the vials, then rifles through a stack of 
      files. He opens one and double checks his facts. He smiles. 
      <p>
<center>DR. BACKER<br/>Yes...</center>
<p>He excitedly WRITES some notes in the file. 
      <p>DISSOLVE TO: 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL ENTRANCE AREA - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander is on watch again. He slumps in a chair, bored and tired. 
      <p>A BAG OF DONUTS falls into frame on the table before him. 
      <p>Cordelia places two coffees on the table as she sits by Xander. He 
      looks at her briefly, then goes for a coffee, sips it as Cordy opens a 
      Cosmo, quietly reads. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL KIDS' WARD - NIGHT 
      <p>Most of the kids are in their beds reading, playing with toys, etc. 
      Buffy comes in, looks around, and sees Ryan at a small table, coloring on 
      a pad. She goes over to him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hi. Remember me? 
      <p>RYAN<br/>You're not supposed to be here. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Why not? 
      <p>RYAN<br/>Contagious. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh, I already got what you got.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He shakes his head. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>What, 'cause I'm a grown-up? Believe<br/>me, I'm 
      not <u>that</u> grown-up --</center>
<p>She stops, looking at his picture. 
      <p>CLOSE-UP of the crayon drawing. Buffy has seen this thing before. 
      <p>FLASH TO: 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE 
      <p>A REPLAY from last night. Ryan stands in the doorway. The pale-visaged 
      fiend passes behind, this time in SLOW MOTION. 
      <p>FLASH TO: 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSP. KIDS' WARD - BACK TO PRESENT (NIGHT) 
      <p>Buffy stares at the drawing. It's almost a perfect likeness of the 
      creepy creature. 
      <p>
<center>RYAN<br/>He'll come again tonight. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Ryan, listen to me. I'm not gonna<br/>let this thing hurt you. 
      Any of you.</p></center>
<p>He is silent. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Grown-ups don't believe you, right?<br/>I do. 
      There are real monsters, we<br/>both know that. But there're 
      real<br/>heroes, too, that fight monsters.<br/>That's me. 
      <p>RYAN<br/>Can't fight death.</p></center>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
      <p>The hallways are eerily DESERTED. 
      <p>Dr. Backer comes out of his office and walks down the hall. Buffy STEPS 
      OUT of the shadows, where she has been waiting and watching. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSP. KIDS' WARD - A MOMENT LATER (NIGHT) 
      <p>The room is dark. The kids are asleep. Dr. Backer quietly comes into 
      the room. He goes over to one of the kids. 
      <p>CLOSE ON: THE CHILD, sleeping peacefully. 
      <p>Dr. Backer holds a syringe up to the light and pushes some of the serum 
      out the top. He disconnects the kid's IV, INJECTS the tube with serum, 
      then re-connects the IV. 
      <p>Buffy appears in the doorway as Dr. Backer finishes his job. As he 
      turns to move to the next bed, Buffy MOVES out of his sight-line, hiding 
      in the hallway. 
      <p>Dr. Backer leans towards another SLEEPING CHILD, when: 
      <p>He hears a NOISE. He looks around, sees nothing, then goes back to his 
      work. 
      <p>Suddenly, Dr. Backer is SLASHED across the arm by an invisible CLAW. He 
      starts to CRY OUT, but an unseen hand CLAMPS over his throat, muffling his 
      voice. 
      <p>We HEAR another SLICE (his stomach, which is below camera view) and his 
      face contorts in pain. The unseen force then THROWS him towards the door 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 
      <p>--and Dr. Backer's body comes TUMBLING out, right past Buffy. 
      <p>Dr. Backer lies on the ground, unmoving. Dead. Buffy goes to him and 
      starts to kneel down when: 
      <p>She is THROWN ASIDE by the invisible force. She SLAMS against a wall 
      and FALLS to the ground, dazed. 
      <p>Dr. Backer's arms are LIFTED UP, and his body begins to move as the 
      unseen thing DRAGS him past Buffy and AROUND A CORNER.

      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS (DAY) 
      <p>Giles, Xander, Willow, and Cordelia come in to find Buffy sitting on 
      the bed. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Well. It looks like you were on to<br/>something after 
      all. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I know. 
      <p>GILES<br/>The girl Tina -- it looks as though<br/>she died from the 
      fever, simple<br/>enough. But her records show her<br/>improving and then 
      suddenly worsening<br/>without apparent cause. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>So we checked out Dr. Backer and this<br/>guy is not the solid 
      citizen -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's not him. Backer was clean. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>What do you mean, clean? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>What do you mean, <u>was</u>? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(shows Ryan's picture)<br/>He's dead. This thing killed 
      him.<br/>And not with kindness. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You saw it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, it was invisible. I saw Backer<br/>nearly shredded and the 
      thing knocked<br/>me down. It's real. Which means I<br/>get to fight it. 
      <p>GILES<br/>It would help if you knew what it<br/>was. It's invisible to 
      you but the<br/>children can see it. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>But you said you did see something<br/>the other night. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, but I was pretty delirious...<br/>I mean, why would I see 
      it then and<br/>not last night?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Joyce enters, smiling. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Good morning. Ooh, it looks like I<br/>interrupted a 
      secret meeting.</center>
<p>Giles emits a fake laugh. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>You sure didn't, though. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Honey, I just talked to the doctor.<br/>She says 
      I can take you home.</p></center>
<p>For a beat, nobody speaks. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I have to stay here. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Stay? But honey, I thought -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I think my symptoms are flaring up<br/>again. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>She doesn't look well. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>'Cause I'm not well. I feel oogy. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Increased oogy-ness... That's a<br/>danger signal. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Are you sure? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. Just for another day... 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Well, I'll talk to the doctor.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She leaves, a tad bemused. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>What's the drill? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(hands Giles the<br/>picture)<br/>Giles, let's get a mug shot on 
      this<br/>guy. I kneed to know who I'm fighting. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Right. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'll check Backer's office. See if<br/>there are any post-its 
      marked 'Why a<br/>monster might want me dead.' 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Sounds like a plan. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>If I do find something, I probably<br/>won't have the slightest 
      idea what it<br/>means, so, Willow... 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Oh, I'm good with medical stuff.<br/>Xander and I used to play 
      doctor all<br/>the time. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(off their looks)<br/>No, she's being literal. She had 
      all<br/>these medical volumes, used to<br/>diagnose me with stuff. I 
      didn't<br/>have the heart to tell her she was<br/>playing it wrong. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Wrong? Why?<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>How did <u>you</u> play doctor? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(lying, embarrassed)<br/>I never have. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Fascinating though this is... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. Right. Go. 
      <p>GILES<br/>We'll call when we know something. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Know something soon.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS (DAY) 
      <p>Giles, Xander and Cordelia come out of Buffy's room. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I'd best head for the library.<br/>Research beckons. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I'm on sentry duty. Angel won't show<br/>'til sundown if at 
      all, but maybe<br/>I'll get lucky with this death guy. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>He's invisible. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yeah, but if I see a floating pipe<br/>and smoking jacket, 
      he's dropped. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, keep alert, you two. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Finding out who this thing is is the<br/>priority. Cordy, you 
      should go with<br/>Giles. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(petulant)<br/>But why do I have to have --<br/>(stops 
      himself)<br/>Good thinking. I could use a<br/>research assistant. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(dead pan look)<br/>Let's go, tact-guy.<br/>(to Xander)<br/>Be 
      careful.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Cordelia and Giles walk off. Xander heads in the other direction. 
      <p>DISSOLVE TO: 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL KIDS' WARD - NIGHT 
      <p>The door opens and Ryan looks out into the hall, silent and 
      conspiratorial. He sees Don standing, idle, nearby. He lets the door shut 
      again, slowly. 
      <p>INT. DR. BACKER'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER (DAY) 
      <p>The office is empty. Dark. Eerie. Just as Dr. Backer left it the night 
      before. The DOOR opens; Buffy and Willow come inside. 
      <p>They move inside and shut the door. Buffy TURNS ON THE LIGHTS; they 
      look around. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>It's weird going through his stuff.<br/>He didn't finish 
      his coffee. Guess<br/>he won't.</center>
<p>She sees a folder, starts leafing through it. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Yet another person I wasn't in time<br/>to save. I wish 
      Angel had put me in<br/>the hospital sooner.<br/>(pauses)<br/>There's a 
      sentence I never expected<br/>to say. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I think I got something here. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah?</p></p></center>
<p>She opens the folder and starts leafing through the contents as Buffy 
      searches around the room. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Okay, this makes sense... Dr. Backer<br/>was trying to 
      inoculate kids with<br/>a controlled dosage of the same virus<br/>they 
      already had. Raising their<br/>temperatures to burn the fever out 
      of<br/>them.</center>
<p>Buffy opens the refrigerator; pulls out a couple of VIALS marked with 
      different colored labels. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Would that work? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(looking at charts)<br/>According to this, it was 
      starting<br/>to. So he really was helping the<br/>kids.</p></center>
<p>CLOSE-ON: Ryan's drawing. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (V.O.)<br/>Until that thing stopped him.</center>
<p>INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 
      <p>PULL BACK from the drawing to see Giles is comparing it to 
      illustrations in a book (sort of a mug book for phantoms and demons) 
      looking for a match. Cordelia peruses another book. 
      <p>Giles turns page after page; Cordelia lingers on each one. (His stack 
      of books dwarfs hers.) 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Ew. What's this one do? 
      <p>GILES<br/>What?<br/>(looks over, annoyed)<br/>Oh. It, um, extracts vital 
      internal<br/>organs so that it can regenerate its<br/>own mutating cells. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Wow.<br/>(turns a page)<br/>What's this one do? 
      <p>GILES<br/>(lets out a breath)<br/>It elongates its mouth to engulf 
      the<br/>head of its casualty between its<br/>teeth. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Ouch.<br/>(turns a page)<br/>What's this one do? 
      <p>GILES<br/>(fed up)<br/>It asks endless questions of those<br/>with whom 
      it's supposed to be working<br/>but they're not getting anything done! 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Boy, there's a demon for everything.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles pushes his book aside; frustrated. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I'm not even sure we're going down<br/>the right track. 
      Since this<br/>miscreant is only seen by select<br/>individuals, there's a 
      chance we<br/>won't ever find a picture of it.</center>
<p>Cordelia finishes paging through a book. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Well, it's not in here.</center>
<p>She closes the book. There, ON THE COVER, is the MONSTER. 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER (NIGHT) 
      <p>Cordelia holds the book as she speaks into the phone. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>It's called 'Der Kindestod.'</center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME TIME (NIGHT) 
      <p>Willow stands next to Buffy, who speaks into the phone. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Who is this?</center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S HOSPITAL ROOM/INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATION. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>It's me. I got your monster.</center>
<p>Buffy gives Willow a strange look. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(confused)<br/>Where's Giles? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Looking up stuff. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Well, can you put him on? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Hey, I found this Kindestod guy.<br/>Just listen. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Right. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>The name means 'Child Death.' This<br/>book says he feeds 
      off of children by<br/>sucking the life out of them. Blech.<br/>But 
      afterwards, it just looks like<br/>they died because they were sick. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So it <u>did</u> kill Tina? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>That's my take. 'Cause it would be<br/>looking at that 
      children's ward as<br/>basically an all-you-can-eat kind of<br/>thing. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Backer was curing the kids -- and<br/>taking away the 
      Kindestod's food. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Hence the slice-age.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles comes over to Cordelia holding another book. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I found a picture of how it kills.<br/>Let me talk 
      to--</center>
<p>Cordelia snatches the book out of his hand and looks at the picture 
      (which we cannot see). She reacts disgusted into the phone. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>EWW! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>You should see how this thing does<br/>its things! I mean... 
      ewww!</p></p></center>
<p>She doesn't want a part of this. She hands the book and the phone to 
      Giles. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont'd)<br/>I don't know why you dragged me 
here.</center>
<p>Giles takes the phone. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Buffy, you still there? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hanging on every 'ew.' 
      <p>GILES<br/>(off picture)<br/>The Kindestod gorges by sitting atop<br/>his 
      prey, pinning it down helplessly.<br/>Then he slowly draws out the 
      life.<br/>It must be horrifying for the victim.<br/>(a 
      beat)<br/>Buffy?</p></p></center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME TIME (NIGHT) 
      <p>Buffy is silent, staring off into space. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.C.)<br/>Hello?</center>
<p>A FLASH fills the screen and we are: 
      <p>INT. DIFFERENT HOSPITAL ROOM - NINE YEARS AGO (NIGHT) 
      <p>HAZY DREAM-CAM: 
      <p>Little Buffy finishes pulling the curtain all the way back. She sees 
      her cousin Celia lying in bed, GASPING and PANTING as she is PINNED DOWN 
      by an invisible force. 
      <p>
<center>LITTLE BUFFY<br/>Celia?</center>
<p>Little Buffy approaches closer. Suddenly, Celia shoots out her hand and 
      GRABS Little Buffy's wrist tightly. Terror covers Celia's face as she 
      struggles for breath. 
      <p>
<center>LITTLE BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>What's wrong? 
      <p>CELIA<br/>Get it off me! Get it off me!</p></center>
<p>Little Buffy looks on, horrified. 
      <p>
<center>LITTLE BUFFY<br/>I don't know what to do! Celia!</center>
<p>The screen FADES TO WHITE and then to:

      <p>Buffy holds the phone, numb with shock. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.C.)<br/>Buffy? Buffy, what is it?</center>
<p>Willow looks at Buffy, concerned. She grabs the phone out of her hand. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>(into phone)<br/>Thanks.</center>
<p>She hangs up. Buffy turns to Willow with resolve. 
      <p>

      <p>WILLOW<br/>You saw it once.

<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. DR. BACKER'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER (NIGHT) 
      <p>Buffy reaches inside Dr. Backer's refrigerator and pulls out a 
      RED-LABELED VIAL containing the virus. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Buffy, think about this. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I am. Lots of thoughts. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>It's crazy. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The fever. That's how you see the<br/>Kindestod. That's why 
      Celia could<br/>see it. That's why Ryan still can.<br/>It's the only way. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>But how can you fight this thing when<br/>you have a 107 
      degree temperature? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I guess we'll find out.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy raises the vial to her lips. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Buffy! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(stopping)<br/>Willow, I'm doing this-- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That's 100% pure. It'll kill you in<br/>an instant.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks at the vial. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>They should put that on the label. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(sighs)<br/>Here. It needs to be diluted.</p></center>
<p>She takes the vial, pours some water into a beaker and mixes a drop of 
      the virus into it. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>This is going to have to work fast.</center>
<p>Willow puts another drop into the beaker. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Faster than that.</center>
<p>Willow pours in another drop and hands the beaker to Buffy. Buffy looks 
      at it; takes a breath. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Here's to my health.</center>
<p>Buffy swallows it down. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER (NIGHT) 
      <p>Buffy, who is starting to feel the effects of the virus, has her arm 
      over Willow's shoulder as they make their way to the kids' ward. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I'm not sure this was such a great<br/>idea. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Hang in there. You'll be okay.</p></center>
<p>Buffy gets to the large window that looks into the kids' ward. She

      few of the children COUGH and WHEEZE. The little girl struggles to keep 
      up. 
      <p>
<center>RYAN<br/>Keep quiet!</center>
<p>Ryan goes to the little girl. 
      <p>
<center>RYAN (cont'd)<br/>It's not gonna find us here.</center>
<p>Ryan takes her by the hand and they continue on. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - SAME TIME (NIGHT) 
      <p>Buffy and Willow stand outside the kids' ward. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>What could've happened? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(thinking)<br/>I don't know. Maybe I'm too late.<br/>Maybe they 
      were moved. I don't want<br/>to think about the other maybe.</p></center>
<p>Buffy SWAYS a bit and steadies herself on Willow. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Oh... I'm burning up.</center>
<p>Buffy puts her hand to her head and looks through the window again. She 
      FREEZES. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Willow? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I think it's in there.</p></p></center>
<p>BUFFY'S POV: through the window. 
      <p>A VAGUE SHAPE begins to SHIMMER into view, until the Kindestod is 
      COMPLETELY VISIBLE to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>(through the window)<br/>Good to see 
you.</center>
<p>Buffy watches as the Kindestod SNIFFS around the room. He seems to have 
      caught a scent. 
      <p>Buffy goes to the door and tries to open it. It's LOCKED. The noise 
      causes the Kindestod to look up. He SMILES. He turns away, keeps sniffing 
      -- the scent takes him out through a door marked (you guessed it) 
      "Basement Access." 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>He's going after them.</center>
<p>She RAMS her shoulder into the door, trying to break it down, but she's 
      too weak. With all her might, she tries again. Nothing. She falls against 
      the door. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>We've got to get him.<br/>(then, wearily)<br/>Give 
      me a second and we'll get him.</center>
<p>Dr. Wilkinson comes around a corner and sees the ill-looking Buffy 
      leaning against the door. She goes to her. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Buffy, what's wrong? WILLOW<br/>She's... not 
      feeling well. Again.</center>
<p>Dr. Wilkinson puts her arm around Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>You should be in bed. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I'm fine. Really. 
      <p>DR. WILKINSON<br/>No. You're coming with me.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy tries to pull away from her, but Dr. Wilkinson is insistent, 
      almost dragging Buffy down the hall. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>No!</center>
<p>Buffy SHOVES Dr. Wilkinson away. She falls backwards, against a wall. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>(sympathetically; to<br/>Dr. Wilkinson) She's 
      sorry...</center>
<p>Buffy and Willow take off down the hall. 
      <p>Dr. Wilkinson hurriedly reaches for a phone on the wall. Her words ECHO 
      throughout the hospital. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>(into phone)<br/>Security to the children's ward. 
      We<br/>have a situation. Security!</center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSP. - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER 
      <p>Buffy and Willow come around a corner. Buffy stumbles a bit; Willow 
      helps her along. 
      <p>They look up and see Don and another SECURITY GUARD running towards 
      them. The girls stop, trapped. Don slaps his billy club in his palm 
      repeatedly. 
      <p>
<center>DON<br/>Come on, now. Let's make this easy.</center>
<p>Buffy and Willow look at each other. Willow looks back at the guards. 
      Then: 
      <p>She goes crazy. She SCREAMS and fights off an invisible attack of: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Bats! Arrghh! Get them off me!<br/>Horrible, horrible 
      bats!</center>
<p>The guards head towards Willow. Buffy backs away. 
      <p>She SLIPS AWAY as the security guards grab Willow. Dr. Wilkinson 
      appears from the other direction. 
      <p>
<center>DR. WILKINSON<br/>Not her. The other one!</center>
<p>Willow stops fighting, suddenly serene. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>No more bats.</center>
<p>The guards let go of her; look up and down the hallway. No more Buffy, 
      either. 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL ENTRANCE AREA - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy STAGGERS into view. She stops, nearly winded. Bends over, hands 
      on her knees, as she catches her breath. 
      <p>Xander runs up, breathless and panicked. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Buffy! Are you okay? Did Angel get in? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We have to get to the basement.</p></center>
<p>She staggers forward, her head heavy. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>(weakly)<br/>Give me your... you.</center>
<p>She puts her arm over Xander's shoulder and they follow after the 
      Kindestod. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL BASEMENT - NIGHT 
      <p>We PAN along the wall and find the kids HUDDLED together in a corner. 
      The little girl SHIVERS and SHAKES. 
      <p>
<center>RYAN<br/>Here.</center>
<p>Ryan takes off his jacket and wraps it around her. She looks up at him. 

      <p>
<center>RYAN (cont'd)<br/>It's okay. We're going to be 
safe<br/>in--</center>
<p>Suddenly, the Kindestod is behind him. The kids SCREAM. 
      <p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL STAIRWELL - CONT. - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander helps Buffy down quickly. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>You don't know how to kill this thing. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(grim determination)<br/>I thought I might try violence. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Solid call.</p></p></center>
<p>INT. SUNNYDALE HOSPITAL BASEMENT - CONT. - NIGHT 
      <p>The Kindestod LIFTS Ryan into the air, then TOSSES him to the ground. 
      The Kindestod JUMPS on top of Ryan and PINS his arms down. Ryan KICKS and 
      tries to FIGHT HIM OFF. 
      <p>The Kindestod's eyes BULGE, then begin to PROTRUDE from his head. They 
      extend downward like tentacles and ATTACH themselves against Ryan's 
      forehead, PRESSING IN hard. Ryan's struggles quickly subside as his 
      strength is drained. 
      <p>A two-by-four SMASHES into the Kindestod's face. He rolls backwards, 
      off of Ryan, revealing BUFFY standing there. She glares at the Kindestod. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You make me sick.</center>
<p>The creature dives at Buffy and they begin to wrestle. Buffy is weak 
      from the fever, but she gives it her all -- swinging, kicking, mostly 
      missing. 
      <p>Xander goes to Ryan and helps him up. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Come on!</center>
<p>Xander herds him and the other kids to the door. Looking back he sees: 
      <p>XANDER'S POV: Buffy fights nothing. 
      <p>NEW ANGLE: 
      <p>Buffy and the Kindestod (visible to us) continue their fight. Buffy 
      JUMPS on his back. He FLIPS Buffy over, SNARLS, and pins her to the floor. 
      Buffy struggles to free herself, but she's too weak. She's trapped. 
      <p>The Kindestod STARES down at her. His eyes BULGE OUT and begin 
      extending down towards Buffy's forehead. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>And the winner is...</center>
<p>With her last bit of strength, Buffy reaches up with both hands, grabs 
      the Kindestod by the head, and TWISTS, cracking his neck. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Power Girl.</center>
<p>She dumps the body to the ground, standing up as Xander approaches. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Are you okay? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Actually, I'm starting to feel better.</p></center>
<p>She wobbles, then COLLAPSES. Xander is there to catch her. 
      <p>DISSOLVE TO: 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S BEDROOM - DAY (A FEW DAYS LATER) 
      <p>Joyce comes in with a smile, carrying a tray of food -- sandwich, soup, 
      juice, the works. She's clearly enjoying getting to play mother to her 
      daughter. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Here you go, honey. Peanut butter<br/>and extra jelly. 
      With the crust off,<br/>just the way you like it.</center>
<p>We MOVE with Joyce to REVEAL Buffy sitting upright in her bed (on top 
      of the covers). She is flanked by Xander and Willow. All have made 
      themselves comfortable, slouching against the headboard, watching TV with 
      their shoes kicked off, drinking sodas, etc. 
      <p>Joyce sets the tray in front of Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(pointing to a glass)<br/>And the juice? 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Two parts orange, one part grapefruit. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's my drink. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>I measured exactly.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Joyce starts to go-- 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (O.C.)<br/>Mom?</center>
<p>--then turns back. Buffy has lifted the top piece of bread from her 
      sandwich. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(sheepishly)<br/>I wanted crunchy style. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Oh. I'm sorry.</p></center>
<p>She picks up the plate with a smile. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>And, um, I ordered <u>extra</u> jelly. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Anything to help my daughter get well.</p></center>
<p>Willow rattles the ice in her glass. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>While you're up, could I get a refill?</center>
<p>Joyce looks at her, the smile fading a bit. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>It's just... I'm so comfortable. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>(taking her glass)<br/>Of course. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Ooh, and another bag of Chee-Zee<br/>Chips. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>You ate the last one. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>No. I saw another bag hidden behind<br/>the raisins. 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>(gritting her teeth)<br/>I'm on it.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She starts out. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(sotto, to Buffy)<br/>Your mom's trying to bogart the 
      Chee-<br/>Zee Chips. What's <u>that</u> all about? 
      <p>JOYCE<br/>Oh, Buffy. Here.</p></center>
<p>Joyce stops at the door and turns back, pulling an envelope out of her 
      pocket. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE (cont'd)<br/>This came in the mail.</center>
<p>Buffy takes it; looks at the return address. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>It's from Ryan.</center>
<p>Buffy OPENS the letter and pulls out a piece of paper; looks at it. She 
      SMILES. Joyce looks over Buffy's shoulder. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE<br/>Oh, he drew you a picture. Isn't<br/>that...</center>
<p>CLOSE-UP of the drawing -- Ryan's crayon rendition of Buffy ('Power 
      Girl!' written on her shirt) standing triumphantly over the broken, 
      horribly bloodied body of Der Kindestod. Rather grotesque. 
      <p>
<center>JOYCE (O.C.)<br/>(appalled)<br/>...nice...</center>
<p>
<div align="right">BLACK OUT.</div>
