      <p>After a beat we HEAR a STRANGE, HIGH PITCHED WAILING – 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. BUFFY’S HOUSE – NIGHT 
      <p>CLOSE ON XANDER – Concerned 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Is she dying?</center>
<p>BUFFY AND WILLOW 
      <p>Flank him on the couch. Slumped down in high teen boredom, sodas and 
      junk food pilfered from Buffy’s kitchen scattered about, watching T.V. – 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>She’s singing.</center>
<p>ANGLE – THE T.V. 
      <p>An EAST INDIAN soap opera on an obscure cable channel: an INDIAN WOMAN 
      sings (in a foreign language) something very heartfelt into a telephone. 
      <p>BUFFY, WILLOW &amp; XANDER 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>To a telephone, in Urdu… now that’s <br/>entertainment. 
      Why is she singing? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>She’s sad because her lover gave her a <br/>dozen gold coins 
      but then the wizard <br/>cut open the bag of salt and the dancing 
      <br/>minions had no place to put their big 
      <br/>Maypole…<br/>(gestures)<br/>…fish thing. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Uh huh. And why is she <u>singing</u>? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Her lover? I thought he was her chiropractor. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Because of that thing he did with her <br/>feet? No, that was 
      personal.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They stare at the screen for a beat. The PIERCING SINGING continues 
      under: 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>And we thought just ‘cause we didn’t have <br/>any money 
      or anywhere to go this’d be a<br/>lackluster evening. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Hey, I know – we could go to the Bronze, <br/>sneak in our own 
      tea bags and ask for…<br/>hot water. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Hop off that outlaw train, Will, before<br/>you land us all in 
      jail. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I for one am giddy and up. There’s a kind <br/>of hush all over 
      Sunnydale, no vampires <br/>or demons to slay, I’m here with my <br/>friends 
      and—<br/>(re: T.V.)<br/>-- where does the water buffalo fit in 
      again?</p></p></p></center>

<p>EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE – BACK YARD – NIGHT 
      <p>Shooting the back of the house, preferably a classic Colonial, 
      preferably no neighboring homes in sight. 
      <p>PUSHING IN on the quiet affluent house and then – 
      <p>AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW IS SHATTERED 
      <p>And a PRETTY GIRL (17, wearing a ceremonial-type dress) bursts through 
      the glass, hits the ground and runs for her life. 
      <p>A moment later, several dark figures in hooded robes emerge from other 
      windows and doors like malevolent ghosts and give chase. 
      <p>She vaults a fence, heading for the woods. She’s fast. 
      <p>They’re faster. 
      <p>EXT. WOODS – NIGHT 
      <p>She tears through running for all she’s worth. 
      <p>The hooded figures close the gap behind her. 
      <p>She cuts right, sees a couple of the hoods gaining on that flank. 
      <p>She cuts sharp to the left and sees a break in the trees, a not so 
      distant road with cars – freedom. 
      <p>She glances behind her – she’s ten yards ahead of her closest pursuer – 
      three trees between her and the open space that leads to the road, then 
      two, then one – 
      <p>As she passes the last tree, a HOODED FIGURE coolly steps out and grabs 
      her. She SCREAMS, he purrs: 
      <p>
<center>HOODED FIGURE<br/>Callie… Where are you going?</center>
<p>The girl, her eyes wild with fear, claws at him, pulling his hood off 
      revealing the face of a handsome twenty year old sadist. He deflects her 
      blows and grabs her wrists, puts his face close to hers. 
      <p>
<center>FIGURE<br/>The party ain’t even started yet.</center>
<p>And, not without charm, the Figure smiles at Callie. Then nods at the 
      brethren. Several of them hustle Callie back towards the house. 
      <p>
<center>CALLIE<br/>No! No!</center>
<p>The Figure takes a deep breath of the bracing night air and walks out 
      of frame.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL HALL – DAY – CORDELIA 
      <p>laughs in a HIGHLY AMUSED if somewhat forced manner. She’s with a 
      Cordette. KIDS are arriving for school. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Ha ha ha ha ha.</center>
<p>Cordelia show s the Cordette a magazine (TEEN TIME). Pretty girl on the 
      cover holding a fishing rod and big lure; headline: HOW TO LAND HIM AND 
      KEEP HIM. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont’d)<br/>Doctor Debbi says when a man is 
      speaking<br/>you make serious eye contact and really,<br/>really listen. And 
      you laugh at everything<br/>he says… ha ha ha ha…</center>
<p>ANOTHER ANGLE – BUFFY AND WILLOW 
      <p>Heading up the steps. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>You dreamed about Angel again? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Third night in a row. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What did he do in the dream? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Stuff. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Ooh, stuff. Was it one of those vivid<br/>dreams where you 
      could feel his lips<br/>and smell his hair? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(nods)<br/>It had surround sound. I’m just thinking<br/>about 
      him so much lately. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well you guys are so right for each <br/>other, except for 
      the, uh… 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Vampire thing? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>That doesn’t make him a bad person. <br/>Necessarily. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I’m brainsick, I can’t have a relationship<br/>with him. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well maybe not in the day time… but you<br/>could ask him for 
      coffee some night.<br/>(off Buffy’s look)<br/>It’s the non-relationship 
      drink of choice. <br/>It’s not a date, it’s a caffeinated beverage – 
      <br/>okay it’s hot and bitter, like a relationship <br/>that way but 
      —</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander slides into step with them. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>What’s like a relationship? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Nothing I have.<br/>(mulling, to Willow)<br/>Coffee. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Huh?</p></p></center>
<p>As they pass Cordelia and the Cordette. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>There’s really no comparison between<br/>college men 
      and high school boys –<br/>(re: Xander)<br/>-- I mean look at that. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Cor, you datin’ a college guy now? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Not that it’s any of your business, but I<br/>happen to be 
      seeing a Delta Zeta Kappa. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Oh, an extra-terrestrial, so that’s how you<br/>get a date 
      once you’ve exhausted all the <br/>human guys. 
      <p>CORDEDLIA<br/>You’ll go to college some day, Xander.<br/>I just know your 
      pizza delivery career <br/>will take you so many exciting places.<br/>Ha ha 
      ha ha.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy, Xander and Willow move off as a bell RINGS O.S. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oops, I told Giles I’d met him in the <br/>Library ten 
      minutes ago –<br/>(moving off)<br/>-- there hasn’t been much 
      paranormal<br/>activity lately, he won’t be upset.</center>
<p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. LIBRARY – DAY – GILES IS UPSET 
      <p>Faces Buffy, circles her as: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Just because the paranormal has been more<br/>normal and 
      less… para lately, that is no excuse<br/>for tardiness or letting your 
      guard down. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I haven’t let my guard down. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Oh really? You yawned your way through <br/>weapons training 
      last week, you skipped <br/>hand to hand entirely – I suppose you’re 
      <br/>prepared if some demon springs up behind <br/>you and does 
      this!?</p></p></center>
<p>Without warning, Giles swings at her from behind. Without turning, 
      Buffy’s hand shoots backwards, grabs Giles’ wrist. Buffy pivots and whips 
      Giles’ hand around behind his back, in a painful arm lock. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont’d)<br/>Yes, well, I’m no demon…<br/>(beat)<br/>…which is 
      why you should let go now.</center>
<p>She does. He massages his wrist. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont’d)<br/>When you live atop a mystical 
      convergence<br/>it’s only a matter of time before a fresh hell<br/>breaks 
      loose. Now is the time to train more<br/>strictly, hunt and patrol more 
      keenly, hone<br/>your skills day and night – 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>And the little scrap of my life that still belongs<br/>to me – 
      say from seven to seven oh five in the<br/>morning – can I do what I want 
      to then? 
      <p>GILES<br/>(beat)<br/>Buffy, you think I don’t know what <br/>it’s like to 
      be sixteen? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No, I think you don’t know what it’s like <br/>to be sixteen 
      and a girl and a Slayer. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I may not know precisely – 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Or what it’s like to exterminate vampires<br/>while you’re 
      having fuzzy feelings <br/>towards one. 
      <p>GILES<br/>You’re still…? That is dicey. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, digging on the undead doesn’t <br/>exactly bolster your 
      social life. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Ahh, but you see that’s just where being<br/>different comes in 
      handy. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Can’t have a social life anyway, too busy<br/>killing fiends 
      from hell? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes! You have a duty, a purpose, you have<br/>a life long 
      commitment. How many people<br/>your age do you think can say that? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We talkin’ foreign or domestic – how <br/>‘bout <u>none</u>. 
      </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Giles sighs, he tried. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Well here’s a hard fact of life: we all <br/>have to do 
      things we don’t like. You <br/>have hand to hand this afternoon and 
      <br/>patrol tonight. You’d best come right <br/>here after sixth period and 
      get your <br/>homework done. Don’t dawdle with <br/>your friends.</center>
<p>Buffy just stands there pouting. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont’d)<br/>And don’t think standing there pouting<br/>is 
      going to get to me. It doesn’t.</center>
<p>She pouts. He lies. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont’d)<br/>Not getting to me.</center>

<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH – DAY 
      <p>After school. Cars pulling up, KIDS taking off. Buffy dawdles on a wall 
      near the street. Xander and Willow move up. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Wow, what a long day. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You cut three periods. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yeah, and of course they flew by. <br/>Buffy! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Aren’t you s’posed to be doing your <br/>homework in the 
      library – 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I’m dawdling. With my friends.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy tips forward on the wall like she’s going to fall – catches 
      herself by draping her arms over Xander’s shoulders. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Works for me.</center>
<p>ANOTHER ANGLE – FRONT OF THE SCHOOL – CORDELIA 
      <p>Looking luscious, waits expectantly as a sleek, dark BMW (tinted 
      windows, we can’t see who’s inside) pulls to the curb. 
      <p>She moves to the car. The dark window rolls down revealing RICHARD (the 
      twenty year old sadist from the teaser) in expensive slacks and sport 
      coat. As are the other two DELTA ZETAS in back. 
      <p>In the passenger seat is TOM, also 20, but dressed casually. Tom is 
      rich, too, but he’s not a prick, he’s a low key, decent guy. 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD<br/>Cordelia. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Hi Richard. Nice car.</p></center>
<p>As instructed by her teen magazine, Cordelia never takes her eyes off 
      Richard. 
      <p>We PUSH PAST Richard to Tom, totally engaged by: 
      <p>TOM’S POV – BUFFY 
      <p>Dawdling with Xander and Willow. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Dawdle, dawdle, dawdle… I’m a rebel <br/>and I’ll never 
      ever be any good…</center>
<p>TOM 
      <p>Takes a breath. Something about Buffy… 
      <p>RICHARD 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD<br/>So we’re having a little get together<br/>at the house 
      tomorrow night…</center>
<p>Richard sees the look on Tom’s face, follows it to Buffy, never 
      skipping a beat with Cordelia 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD (cont’d)<br/>… it’s going to be a really special evening… 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(recovering)<br/>Oh I’d love to – 
      <p>RICHARD<br/>Who’s your friend?</p></p></center>
<p>Cordelia turns, sees Buffy behind her on the wall clowning with Xander 
      and Willow. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Her? She’s not my friend. 
      <p>TOM<br/>She’s amazing. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>She’s more like a sister, really. <br/>We’re that close. 
      <p>RICHARD<br/>Why don’t you introduce us?</p></p></p></center>
<p>BUFFY, XANDER AND WILLOW 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Okay so tonight, Channel fifty nine, Indian<br/>T.V. – 
      sex, lies and incomprehensible story<br/>lines – I’ll bring the beetle 
      nuts.</center>
<p>Cordelia walks up, grabs Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Come on, Richard and his fraternity <br/>brothers want 
      to meet you. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I don’t really want to meet any fraternity – 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>And if there was a God, don’tcha’ <br/>think He’d keep it 
      that way?</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy is dragged away. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Hey, I believe we were hanging here…</center>
<p>Cordelia drags Buffy to Richard who has now gotten out of his car. 
      Confident, cool, he flashes his perfect smile at Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD<br/>Hi, sweet thing. I’m Richard. And <br/>you are? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So not interested. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>She’s such a little comedienne!</p></p></center>
<p>Cordelia hits Buffy who is about to turn away when Tom appears behind 
      Richard. 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD<br/>What, is she playing hard to get? 
      <p>TOM<br/>No Richard, I think you’re playing easy<br/>to resist.<br/>(to 
      Buffy)<br/>Feel free to ignore him. I do all the time.</p></center>
<p>Buffy hesitates, this guy seems okay. 
      <p>
<center>TOM (cont’d)<br/>I’m Tom Janson. I’m a Senior at 
      Crestwood<br/>College and I feel like a complete dolt meeting<br/>you this 
      way – so here I stand in all my <br/>doltishness…</center>
<p>XANDER AND WILLOW 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>She’s gonna walk away… now.<br/>(snaps fingers)<br/>Okay 
      boots, start walkin’…</center>
<p>BUFFY AND TOM 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I’m Buffy Summers. 
      <p>TOM<br/>Nice to meet you. Are you a Senior? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Junior. 
      <p>TOM<br/>Me too, except I’m a Senior, and in <br/>college. 
      <br/>(beat)<br/>So, we have that in common.<br/>(beat)<br/>I major in History. 

      <p>BUFFY<br/>History stumps me. I have a hard enough<br/>time remembering 
      what happened last week. 
      <p>TOM<br/>Nothing happened last week, don’t worry,<br/>I was 
there.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy smiles, not smitten but charmed. Behind them, Richard, with other 
      frat guys looking on, says something to Cordelia. We HEAR her “Ha ha ha 
      ha”. 
      <p>XANDER AND WILLOW 
      <p>Xander shakes his head, disgusted. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>I hate these guys. Whatever they want <br/>just falls 
      into their laps. Don’t you<br/>hate these guys? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah, with their charmed lives and their<br/>movie star good 
      looks and more money <br/>than you can count…<br/>(off his look)<br/>I’m 
      hating.</p></center>
<p>BUFFY AND TOM 
      <p>
<center>TOM<br/>(re: Richard and Cordelia)<br/>So my friend asked your 
      friend to this <br/>party we’re having tomorrow night…<br/>(lowers 
      voice)<br/>… actually he’s not really my friend –<br/>I only joined the 
      fraternity ‘cause my <br/>father and grampa were in it before me.<br/>It 
      meant a lot to them. I know, I talk <br/>too much. Anyway, they’re really 
      dull<br/>parties full of really dull people so, uh,<br/>how would you like 
      to come and save<br/>me from a really dull fate? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(beat)<br/>I wish I could but… I’m sort of seeing<br/>someone. 
      <p>TOM<br/>Oh. Sure, of course you are. Well, <br/>thanks for letting me 
      ramble… 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>People underestimate the value of a <br/>good ramble.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Tom smiles. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.S.)<br/>Buffy!</center>
<p>Buffy turns, sees Giles near the front door of school, pointing to his 
      watch. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I gotta… nice to meet you 
      <p>TOM<br/>Same here.</p></center>
<p>Buffy takes off. Tom watches her, intrigued.

<p>INT. LIBRARY – NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy practices her hand to hand with Giles (who wears much protective 
      gear). There’s a certain not-so-sub-text here: they’re pissed at each 
      other. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I’m going to attack you. Word of caution:<br/>for your own 
      good, I won’t be pulling any <br/>punches. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Please don’t.</p></center>
<p>He comes at her with the short sword – she kicks it out of his hand. He 
      immediately counters with a wooden rod – she chops it in half. 
      <p>He charges her, she sidesteps, flips him over her shoulder and slams 
      him down on the ground. Hard. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Good. So you’re on patrol and I’ll see<br/>you in the 
      morning.<br/>(she offers him a hand up)<br/>Thanks, no, I’ll just rest here

      the stakes in her belt.

      <p>Buffy moves through the trees. The Figure follows. 
      <p>BUFFY 
      <p>Stops, sees something glinting in the leaves at her feet. She kneels 
      down. 
      <p>INSERT – BUFFY’S HAND 
      <p>Picks up a BROKEN SILVER PIECE of an I.D. bracelet. Three letters, E, N 
      and T, can be seen, inscribed in the delicate bracelet. 
      <p>BUFFY 
      <p>Studies the bracelet, then: 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL (O.S.)<br/>There’s blood on it.</center>
<p>Startled, Buffy jumps to her feet, sees ANGEL. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh… hi. Nice to… blood?<br/>(studies bracelet) 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>I can smell it. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(beat)<br/>It’s pretty thin, probably belonged <br/>to a 
      girl.</p></p></center>
<p>Angel glances around the woods. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>Probably.</center>
<p>Buffy laughs. He looks back. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I was just mulling, wouldn’t it be funny<br/>to see each 
      other some time when it <br/>wasn’t a blood thing?</center>
<p>Nothing from Angel. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont’d)<br/>Not funny ha ha. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>What are you saying, you want to have <br/>a date? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No – 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>You don’t want to have a date. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Who said date? I never said date. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Right, you just want to have coffee or<br/>something. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Coffee?</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy makes a “that’s ridiculous” sound. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>I knew this would happen. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Really? And what do you think is happening? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>You’re sixteen years old, I’m two <br/>hundred and forty. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I’ve done the math. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>You don’t know what you’re doing, you<br/>don’t know what you 
      want. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Oh I think I do: I want out of this <br/>conversation.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She turns to walk away. He grabs her. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>Listen. If we date you and I both know <br/>one thing’s 
      going to lead to another. <br/>Then what? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Then… whatever, I don’t know, might be<br/>nice to find out. 
      But you want to end it <br/>before it’s begun. Fine.</p></center>
<p>Angel just shakes his head. 
      <p>
<center>ANGEL<br/>It’s a Fairy Tale. Only when I kiss you <br/>you don’t 
      wake up from a deep sleep <br/>and live happily ever after. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No. When you kiss me I want to die.</p></center>
<p>She holds his gaze – then she walks out of frame.

<p>INT. CLASSROOM – DAY 
      <p>Buffy is gathering her stuff as students head out. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (O.S.)<br/>Buffy!</center>
<p>Cordelia moves up. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Did you lose weight? And your hair…<br/>(Buffy ignores 
      her)<br/>All right, I respect you too much to be <br/>dishonest, the 
      hair’s…<br/>(makes a face)<br/>…well that’s not the point here, is it. 
      <br/>The Delta Zetas have to have a certain <br/>balance at their party – 
      Richard explained <br/>it all to me but I was so busy REALLY <br/>LISTENING 
      to him that I didn’t hear much – <br/>anyway, the deal is they need you to 
      go. <br/>And if you don’t go…<br/>(her eyes moisten)<br/>…I can’t! I’m 
      talking about Richard <u>Anderson</u>,<br/>okay? As in Anderson Farms, 
      Anderson <br/>Textiles…<br/>(she can no longer hold back the tears)<br/>… and 
      Anderson Cosmetics! Do you have a <br/>hankie?</center>
<p>Buffy shakes her head. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont’d)<br/>Well you can see why I have to go. These 
      <br/>men are rich, Buffy, and I’m not being <br/>shallow – think of the poor 
      people I could<br/>help with all my money. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I’ll go. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>I’m not going to beg you – please, oh <br/>please – you’ll 
      go? Great! We’ll just take <br/>my car. Oh Buffy, we’re just like 
      sisters…<br/>with really different hair.</p></p></center>
<p>And Cordelia happily moves off. Off Buffy’s expression, pre-lap:

<center>RICHARD (O.S.)<br/>… and my death…</center>
<p>INT. FRAT HOUSE – BASEMENT – NIGHT 
      <p>SHOOTING HIGH ABOVE AN ALTER that’s built up around a dark circle, like 
      a well – and apparently bottomless pit. 
      <p>ANOTHER ANGLE – Richard and other frat minions, in robes (no Tom) are 
      gathered before the alter which has eyes, fangs, diamond shape carvings – 
      an abstract but frightening representation of some horrible <i>thing</i> 
      they worship. Possibly a thing that lives in the bottomless pit. 
      <p>The basement is cut into the bed rock – cave-like out-croppings of 
      stone add an ancient touch to the décor. 
      <p>A YOUNG MAN is naked from the waist up and Richard holds the sword to 
      his chest, carving a large diamond shaped SCAR into his flesh. (Yes, we’ll 
      be tasteful.) 
      <p>
<center>YOUNG MAN<br/>I pledge my life and my death… 
      <p>RICHARD<br/>To the Delta Zetas and to Machida<br/>whom we serve.

      <p>YOUNG MAN<br/>In blood I was baptized, in blood I <br/>shall reign, in

<p>Richard finishes carving the diamond shape. 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD<br/>You are now one of us. 
      <p>YOUNG MAN<br/>In His Name!</p></center>
<p>The others reply: “In His Name!” 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD<br/>Brewski time!</center>
<p>Someone opens a cooler – beers are flung about. Someone turns on a boom 
      box. Suddenly it’s a bunch of college guys in robes guzzling beer and 
      listening to loud music. 
      <p>The various brethren congratulate the Young Man. Richard sees something 
      O.S., moves to: 
      <p>CALLIE 
      <p>The girl from the teaser. Chained to the rock wall. 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD<br/>So what’s a girl like you doing in a <br/>place like 
      this? 
      <p>CALLIE<br/>Please, let me go. 
      <p>RICHARD<br/>Let you go. Okay, let me think – <br/>uhhh, no.</p></p></center>
<p>She cries. He laughs. 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD (cont’d)<br/>Gawd I love high school girls.</center>
<p>Richard sips his beer, tapping his head to the music, digging his

      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>What made you change your mind? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Angel. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>He’s going with you?<br/>(to Xander)<br/>She’s got a date with 
      Angel. Isn’t that <br/>exciting? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I’m elated. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I’m not going with Angel. I’m going <br/>with… ye gods,

      <p>WILLOW<br/>(a little jealous)<br/><u>Cordelia</u>? Did I sound a little

      <p>XANDER<br/>Cordelia’s much better for you than Angel. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>What happened with Angel? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Nothing. As usual. A whole lot of <br/>nothing with Angel. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(hot diggity)<br/>Bummer. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I don’t understand. He likes you.<br/>More than likes. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>The guy hardly ever says two words to me… 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Don’t you hate that. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>… and he treats me like a child. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>That bastard! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>At least Tom can carry on a conversation. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yeah, Tom – who’s Tom?

      <p>Giles, his back to the doors, short sword in hand, deals with an unseen 
      opponent. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>What if a vampire came up behind you <br/>and did 
      that!</center>
<p>Giles swings the sword to the left while ducking and jumping to the 
      right. 
      <p>TRACK WITH Buffy, Xander and Willow as they move into the room and see 
      there is no opponent, Giles is refining the move he tried on Buffy 
      yesterday. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont’d)<br/>Or this!</center>
<p>Giles twists, cuts high, then low – 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont’d)<br/>Hah!</center>
<p>-- and then sees the three of them, quickly straightens up with as much 
      dignity as he can muster. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont’d)<br/>Oh, didn’t see you three…<br/>(under his 
      breath)<br/>…sneaking up like that.</center>
<p>He puts the sword down, turns to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont’d)<br/>All went well last night?</center>
<p>Buffy nods, pulling out the piece of the bracelet she found. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I found this.</center>
<p>INSERT BRACELET – as she holds it out. 
      <p>Willow looks at it as Giles takes it.

<center>GILES <br/>(read letters on it)<br/>“E” “n”, “t”… 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I’ve seen something like that somewhere… 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It’s broken in two, I don’t know what the<br/>other letters 
      might have spelled… and <br/>there’s blood on it. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I don’t see –

      <p>XANDER<br/>The blood.<br/>(Buffy nods)<br/>There’s a guy you want to party 
      with. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Blood… 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Yeah, in Sunnydale, what a surprise. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(re: Buffy)<br/>She should probably make the rounds<br/>again 
      tonight while we try and figure out <br/>who that bracelet belongs to. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(nods)<br/>Good idea. She’ll patrol, we’ll reconvene<br/>after 
      school – 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hello, “she’s” standing right here. And <br/>she’s not 
      available tonight. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Why not? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Buff, this is a little more important than – 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(shut up, Xander)<br/>--I’ve got a mountain of homework, my 
      <br/>mom’s sick and she needs me to take <br/>care of her, and I’m starting 
      to feel a <br/>little woozy myself.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy touches her forehead. Willow and Xander exchange a look. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Oh, if you’re not feeling… 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I’ll make a quick pass early this evening,<br/>and another one 
      later on, but for the bulk<br/>of the evening…

      together. Looks around for a friendly face. Sees: 
      <p>A COOL GUY across the way. He toasts her with his glass. Buffy picks 
      her glass up, toasts back, not wanting to appear unsophisticated, takes a 
      polite sip – it’s strong. Then she sees the BIG TACKLE, hammered, heading 
      her way. 
      <p>
<center>TACKLE<br/>New girl. Dance. Ahhhyeeahh.</center>
<p>Buffy looks left and right for an avenue of escape as the Tackle 
      lumbers in for a landing. Just as he’s upon her, Tom steps between them, 
      takes Buffy’s hand – 
      <p>
<center>TOM<br/>Could I have this dance?</center>
<p>-- and pulls her to the dance floor. Perhaps we hear a crash of plates

      louts.<br/>(Buffy smiles)<br/>I’m really glad you decided to 
      come.<br/>(nothing from Buffy)<br/>And you’re not. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No. It’s just… I shouldn’t be here. 
      <p>TOM<br/>Because you’re seeing someone. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>No. 
      <p>TOM<br/>You’re not seeing someone. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Someone’s not seeing me. 
      <p>TOM<br/>So why shouldn’t you be here? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I have obligations, people I’m responsible <br/>to… or for… or 
      with, it’s complex. 
      <p>TOM<br/>You’re big on responsibility. I like that. <br/>But there’s such 
      a thing as too mature. <br/>You should relax and enjoy yourself <br/>once in 
      a while. <p.buffy<br>You think I’m too mature. 
      <p>TOM<br/>I talk too much. Have you picked up on that<br/>yet? Anyway, the 
      Hulk is gone so you <br/>don’t have to dance with me any –</p></p.buffy<br></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He starts to step back – she doesn’t let him go. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>He might come back.
      <center></center>
<p>He smiles. And she puts her head on his shoulder. And they dance for a 
      couple of beats. 
      <p>ANGLE: XANDER CHATS WITH TWO CO-EDS 
      <p>He swipes the air with a couple of crab claws. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Godzilla is attacking downtown Tokyo!<br/>Argh! 
      Argh!</center>
<p>The co-eds laugh. 
      <p>ANOTHER ANGLE – THE TACKLE AND RICHARD 
      <p>Watch him. 
      <p>
<center>TACKLE<br/>You went to Cold Springs with Donny <br/>Hunsinger. Is 
      that his kid brother Stewy? 
      <p>RICHARD<br/>Stewy’s blond and six four. We got us <br/>a 
crasher.</p></center>
<p>Richard smiles unpleasantly. Moves off towards Xander. The Tackle waves 
      the Linebacker over and they follow. 
      <p>XANDER AND CO-EDS 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>So have either of you seen a pair of girls<br/>Here? One 
      is about so high –</center>
<p>Richard, the Tackle and the Linebacker suddenly surround him. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont’d)<br/>Hey guys.</center>
<p>The Tackle grabs one shoulder, the Linebacker the other. 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD<br/>New Pledge! 
      <p>TACKLE<br/>New Pledge!</p></center>
<p>And they drag him away from the co-eds, other Delta Zetas gathering 
      around, chanting “new pledge!”, blotting poor Xander out of sight. 
      <p>EXT. FRAT HOUSE – BACK PATIO – NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy wanders out to get some air. We see the party through the large 
      windows or French doors behind her. She looks off into the woods beyond 
      the back fence. Something CRUNCHES beneath her feet. She bends down. 
      <p>INSERT – BUFFY’S HAND 
      <p>Picks up some broken glass. 
      <p>BACK TO SCENE 
      <p>Buffy straightens up and looks up at the second story. We see the 
      broken and partially patched window the girl burst out of in the teaser. 
      <p>Buffy looks off to the woods where she found the bracelet: is there 
      some connection here? 
      <p>She turns back towards the house, startled to find: 
      <p>
<center>TOM<br/>You okay? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah. I was just… thinking.</p></center>
<p>From inside we hear the party and the music crank up. Richard hurries 
      out, tipsy, thrusts a drink in each of their hands. Clinks their glasses 
      with his own. 
      <p>
<center>RICHARD <br/>To my Argentinean junk bonds which just<br/>matured in 
      double digits!</center>
<p>He holds up his glass and drinks merrily. Tom looks at Buffy, 
      embarrassed by Richard. 
      <p>
<center>TOM<br/>To… maturity.</center>
<p>Tom clinks her glass. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(re: drink)<br/>Ahhh, what the hell.</center>
<p>She downs the whole drink. Tom’s a little surprised. 
      <p>

      <p>A hideous wig of long dark curls parked on his head; an (extremely)

<p>Buffy collapses on the bed. Out cold. A figure appears silhouetted in 
      the doorway. Moves to her. Rolls her over. It’s Richard. He admires her 
      unconscious form for a beat then reaches for her blouse. Undoes the top 
      button. Reaches for the next button when

      <p>Grabs his hand. Spins him around. It’s Tom.

      <p>Tom, stripped to the waist, kneels before the alter which surrounds the 
      dark pit. 
      <p>Several ROBED BRETHREN keep a respectful distance from Tom whose arms 
      and chest sport a dozen or more of the sword-carved diamond shapes. Tom is 
      pretty much the high priest around here. 
      <p>He finishes whatever silent prayer he was offering, picks up the long 
      sword, holds it over the pit as a form of blessing, then hands it to a 
      brethren. 
      <p>The brethren begins carving yet another diamond on Tom as we 
      (discreetly) PAN AWAY to: 
      <p>CORDELIA – COMING TO 
      <p>Chained to a rock wall. Now dressed in the same ceremonial garb as the 
      girl in the teaser. Her hair is mussed and as she takes in her 
      surroundings, her eyes fill with fear. She looks to 
      <p>BUFFY 
      <p>Chained next to her. Also in ceremonial dress. Buffy is already awake 
      and alert, gazing around the basement, taking everything in. From this 
      angle she can only see Tom from the back (i.e. she doesn’t know it’s Tom.) 

      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Buffy… where are we? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>In the basement, far as I can tell. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>What’s happening? What did they…? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>They drugged us. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Why? What are they gonna do?

<center>BUFFY<br/>Three stones… three of us.

      us</u>…</p></p></p></center>
<p>AT THE ALTER 
      <p>The rumbling grows louder and more fierce. The brethren are all 
      glass-eyed, murmuring “Machida” feverishly. And suddenly, with a great 
      explosion, the HORRIBLE THING bursts out of the big black pit. 
      <p>MACHIDA is half man, half snake. He has a muscular body (from the waist 
      up) and the enlarged and frightening head of a man with the fangs and 
      horrible eyes of a snake. His skin has the diamond pattern of a snake – 
      thus the diamond carvings on his “people”. From the waist down he is all 
      snake – and a big ‘un, too, his snake body trails behind him into the 
      depths of the pit: God knows how long this guy is. 
      <p>Machida towards over the brethren and stretches his glistening body so 
      he can look down on Buffy, Cordelia and Callie. 
      <p>Off Buffy, looking up at the hideous Delta Zeta deity, and Cordelia 
      screaming for all she’s worth.

      <p>As before. Machida hovers over the girls. 
      <p>
<center>TOM<br/>For he shall rise from the depths and we<br/>shall tremble 
      before him. He who is the <br/>source of all we inherit and all we

<p>Richard and a brethren start to unlock Cordelia’s chains. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Feed him. <u>FEED HIM</u>?!</center>
<p>Buffy pulls like hell at her own chains. They hold fast. Richard and 
      brethren drag Cordelia, whimpering now, before Machida. Cordelia looks 
      like she’s about to lose her mind. Buffy struggles with her chains. 
      <p>Machida rises up, ready to dive for Cordelia. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hey, Reptile Boy!</center>
<p>Machida turns his gaze to Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>TOM<br/>No woman speaks to him! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You don’t want her. She’s all skin and <br/>bones. Half hour 
      later you’ll be hungry <br/>again. Why don’t you try me –</p></center>
<p>And Tom backhands her viciously, nearly knocking her out. Brandishes 
      his sword.

<p>EXT. FRAT HOUSE – NIGHT 
      <p>Angel, Willow and Giles exit the Giles-mobile and head for the darkened 
      frat house. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Looks like everyone’s gone.</center>
<p>As they approach, a robed figure steps out of the shadows behind them. 
      Angel senses the intruder, slows his pace and suddenly leaps on him.

<p>It’s Xander, in one of the D.Z robes. He pulls the hood back. There’s a 
      tear in the front of the robe. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>What are you doing here? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>There’s a bunch of girls missing, the <br/>Delta Zetas may be 
      involved and<br/>Buffy – are you wearing make-up? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(rubs at his face)<br/>No. I think Buffy’s still inside 
      <br/>somewhere with Cordelia.<br/>(points to car)<br/>That’s her car. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Why are you wearing that…? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I found it in their trash.<br/>(re: house)<br/>I saw them 
      through the windows, wearing <br/>robes, going down to the basement. I was 
      <br/>going to use it to sneak in. 
      <p>GILES<br/>They may be involved in some kind of ritual. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>With the missing girls. 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>With Buffy.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Angel looks to the house, his anger mounting, and MORPHS into a vampire 
      with a fierce growl. Willow and the others take a step back. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Okay, that <u>is</u> the guy you want to party 
      with.</center>
<p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. FRAT HOUSE – NIGHT 
      <p>The Tackle and the Linebacker keep a watch in the darkened rooms. They 
      hear someone KNOCKING, move to one of the doors in back, see a dark figure 
      in a robe outside. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(in robe)<br/>Got locked out dumping the trash. Let 
      <br/>me in, I don’t want to miss the “you <br/>know what…”</center>
<p>The Tackle peers hard at the robed figure, unlatches the door. The 
      minute he does, Xander kicks open the door and hits him as hard as he can 
      in the face. 
      <p>The Tackle staggers back. Angel, Giles, Willow rush in. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont’d)<br/>(to Tackle)<br/><u>Where are they</u>?!</center>
<p>The Tackle charges Xander who sidesteps him and helps run his head into 
      a banister. The Linebacker charges Angel – sees Angel’s face – screams! 
      <p>INT. FRAT BASEMENT – SAME TIME 
      <p>Tom Stands behind Cordelia, beneath Machida. 
      <p>
<center>TOM<br/>Receive our offering!</center>
<p>They hear fighting and bodies crashing to the floor above. 
      <p><centertom (cont’d)<br="">Go!
      <center></center>
<p>Richard charges upstairs with several of the brethren. 
      <p>Machida rises to his full height. 
      <p>Cordelia cowers beneath him. 
      <p>Machida dives. 
      <p>DIVING POV – WE SWOOP DOWN TOWARDS CORDELIA 
      <p>Who screams bloody murder. 
      <p>Buffy uses all her strength and rips her chain and eye hooks right out 
      of the wall. 
      <p>Buffy whips the chain and hits Machida with it. He rears back, 
      screaming. 
      <p>Cordelia scampers back to relative safety as – 
      <p>Buffy whips her chain into two attacking brethren, knocking them down. 
      <p>Tom picks up the sword and charges Buffy who ducks and backs away as he 
      attacks, nearly taking her head off. 
      <p>INT. FRAT HOUSE – UPSTAIRS – NIGHT 
      <p>Angel throws a guy across the room. Xander is on the Tackle, piggy 
      back, hitting him on the head from behind. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>That’s for the wig, and that’s for the bra…</center>
<p>Willow and Giles weave their way through the carnage to the basement 
      door. Willow manages to get the door open as Giles is blind sided by a 
      brethren. Giles holds him off and decks him. 
      <p>Willow runs down a couple of steps into the basement, runs back up, 
      yells to the gang: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Some guy’s attacking Buffy with a sword!<br/>(beat, 
      realizes: )<br/>Also, there’s a really big snake. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>… that’s for the make-up and that’s for <br/>the last sixteen 
      and a half years!</p></center>
<p>Xander gives him one last good wallop and leaps off. The tackle falls 
      forward, out of frame, we HEAR him crash through the French doors. Xander 
      stands there, pretty darn satisfied with himself for half a beat until 
      Richard hits him like a train from the side. 
      <p>Angel drops Richard like a stone. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Guys, Buffy, snake, basement, now!</center>
<p>They all charge toward the basement door. 
      <p>INT. FRAT HOUSE – BASEMENT – NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy scrambles away from Tom and his attacking sword. 
      <p>
<center>TOM<br/>You… bitch. I’ll serve you to him in pieces!</center>
<p>He swings hard. Buffy ducks and counters with the chain, wraps it 
      around the sword, rips it out of Tom’s hands. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Tom…</center>
<p>And Buffy hits him with a right, then a left, then she spin-kicks him 
      in the side of the head – he flies back, trips on the alter, falls on his 
      ass. Down and out. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont’d)<br/>You talk too much.</center>
<p>Angel, Xander, Willow and Giles tear downstairs as Machida gatheres 
      Cordelia in his arms. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/><u>Hellllppppp</u>!!!</center>
<p>Buffy suddenly looms up with the sword. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Back off, wormy!</center>
<p>Machida ROARS at her. Buffy raises the sword and brings it down hard 
      and fast on the middle of Machida’s snake body, cutting him in half. 
      <p>XANDER, GILES, WILLOW 
      <p>And Angel react. 
      <p>CORDELIA 
      <p>Falls to the floor, safe. 
      <p>THE PIT 
      <p>As what’s left of the severed snake jiggles and lies still a couple of 
      feet from the upper torso. 
      <p>BUFFY 
      <p>Helps Cordelia up. Willow and Xander un-chain a <u>very freaked out 
      Callie</u>. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>You did it, you saved us.</center>
<p>Cordelia walks right past Buffy and hurls herself into Angel’s arms. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont’d)<br/>I’ve never been so happy to see anyone <br/>in 
      my whole…<br/>(fights the tears)<br/>You guys, I just really… hate you guys, 
      the <br/>weirdest things always happen around you!</center>
<p>Tom comes to near the alter. And, unbeknownst to any of our heroes, the 
      snake body begins slowly moving. Until it joins up with the torso. A 
      squooshy sound of flesh and protoplasm meeting and the two halves re-join! 

      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (cont’d)<br/>(to Tom)<br/>You’re going to jail for about 
      fifteen<br/>thousand years. Oh god, it’s over…<br/>it’s really…</center>
<p>That’s when Machida, re-joined, suddenly pops up again. 
      <p>Angel takes a threatening step forward next to Buffy and growls. 
      <p>Machida towers over Tom: 
      <p>
<center>MACHIDA<br/>For a hundred years I have given your forebearers 
      <br/>wealth and power. And this is how you repay me. <br/>From this day 
      forth you are alone in the world.</center>
<p>Machida slides back down. Cordelia is afraid to breathe. With good 
      reason. Machida pops back up, grabs Tom. 
      <p>
<center>MACHIDA (cont’d)<br/>Lil’ somethin’ for the road.</center>
<p>Machida disappears into the pit with Tom. We hear Tom’s screams, a 
      quick couple of chomps and then silence. 
      <p>Willow and Xander help Callie toward the stairs. 
      <p>Buffy moves to Giles. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I told one lie, I had one drink… 
      <p>GILES<br/>And you nearly got devoured by a giant<br/>demon-snake. I think 
      the words “let that be <br/>a lesson” are a tad redundant at this juncture. 

      <p>BUFFY<br/>Sorry, Giles. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I am, too. I drive you too hard, because I <br/>know what you 
      have to face… from now <br/>on no more pushing, no more prodding…</p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy smiles. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont’d)<br/>Just… an extraordinary amount of 
      nudging.</center>
<p>Off them, 
      <p>
<div align="right">DISSOLVE TO:</div>
<p>INT. BRONZE – NIGHT 
      <p>A high school freshman, a real young looking one, moves up to Cordelia, 
      hands her a coffee and a muffin. He looks up at her (being so much shorter 
      and all) adoringly. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Thank you, Leslie. Did we forget the <br/>extra 
      foam?</center>
<p>Leslie grabs the coffee and hurries out of frame. Cordelia turns to 
      <p>BUFFY, WILLOW, XANDER 
      <p>Sitting at a nearby table. Xander studies a newspaper. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Young men. The only way to go.</center>
<p>CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER – We see a picture of the Delta Zeta house and the 
      headline: FRATERNITY ARRESTED. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Says here they’ll all get consecutive life<br/>sentences: 
      investigators found bones of the<br/>missing girls in a huge cavern beneath 
      the <br/>D.Z house… and other bones dating back <br/>fifty years… 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>They didn’t find the snake? (Xander shakes his head)<br/>Which 
      means <u>we</u> probably will some <br/>day. Oh goody. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(reads)<br/>“A surprising number of corporations 
      whose<br/>Chairmen and Founders are former Delta<br/>Zetas are suffering 
      falling profits, I.R.S raids<br/>and suicides in the board room…“<br/>(to 
      Buffy and Willow)<br/>Starve a snake, lose a fortune. Boy, the 
      rich<br/>really are different. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Have you heard from Angel?</p></p></p></center>
<p>She shakes her head. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont’d)<br/>When he got so mad about you being in 
      <br/>danger and changed into…<br/>(makes a face)<br/>…grrrr… it was the most 
      amazing thing<br/>I ever saw. I mean how many guys can – 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Angel, Angel, Angel. Does every <br/>conversation always have 
      to come <br/>around to that freak?</p></center>
<p>Xander notices Angel standing right next to him. Doesn’t skip a beat. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont’d)<br/>Hey man, how ya’ doin’? 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>Buffy.</p></center>
<p>Beat. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Angel.</center>
<p>Beat. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/><u>Xander</u>… 
      <p>ANGEL<br/>I hear this place serves coffee. Thought<br/>maybe you and I 
      should get some…<br/>(nothing from Buffy)<br/>…sometime.<br/>(nothing from 
      Buffy)<br/>If you want.</p></center>
<p>Buffy considers him for a long moment, then: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Yeah.</center>
<p>Angel brightens. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont’d)<br/>Sometime. I’ll let you know.</center>
<p>And she gets up and goes. Xander, Willow, Angel stare at her departing 
      back. Xander kind of respects what she just did. So does Angel. 
      <p>ANGLE – BUFFY – WALKING AWAY 
      <p>Tracking backwards with her. Letting her grow into a tight close-up. So 
      we can see how pleased she is. Then she walks out of frame and we –
