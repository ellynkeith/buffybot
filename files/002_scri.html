        ENDING WITH LUKE PINNING BUFFY IN THE TOMB.</b>
<p>FADE IN: 
        <p>INT. MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT 
        <p>LUKE bears down on BUFFY, fangs bared. She struggles, but he's got 
          her pinned. He rips open her shirt a bit to get at her throat. Grabs 
          her - and SCREAMS. 
        <p>He jumps back, SMOKE curling out of his hand. 
        <p>ANGLE: BUFFY'S NECK 
        <p>The cross Angel gave her has slipped out of an inside pocket. 
        <p>Buffy takes the moment and KICKS with both legs, sends Luke flying 
          back out of the tomb. She jumps up herself and before he can recover, 
          she RUNS out of there. 
        <div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>EXT. GRAVEYARD - CONTINUOUS 
        <p>As fast as she can -- stumbling a bit and breathing hard from the beating 
          she took -- Buffy books through the graveyard. As she reaches the trees 
          on the edge of it, she looks back at the Mausoleum. 
        <p>Nobody's coming. 
        <p>She hears WILLOW SCREAM. 
        <p>
<center>
            WILLOW<br/>
            No! Nooo! Get -- off -- 
          </center>
<p>Buffy runs to the sound of the voice -- comes to find: 
        <p>ANGLE: WILLOW 
        <p>on the ground, struggling with a vampire. 
        <p>The vampire has Willow pinned, is going in for the neck -- then he 
          looks up, hearing something. 
        <p>Buffy's foot <b>whips</b> into his face, sending him flying way back. 
        <p>He lands hard on his back and scrambles away, holding his nose. 
        <p>Buffy is all business now, looking around her in quiet fury. Her senses 
          alert. 
        <p>She hears a CRACK, some SCUFFING on the ground. Takes off, leaving 
          Willow wide-eyed and freaked. After a moment, she rises and follows. 
        <p>ANGLE: XANDER 
        <p>is unconscious, being dragged away by two other vampires. They hear 
          something behind them, turn slowly around. 
        <p>It's Willow, stumbling out from behind a tree. She looks extremely 
          unthreatening. 
        <p>They turn back and Buffy is right in front of them. She takes them 
          both out with one punch. They fly back, then scramble to their feet. 
        <p>Buffy grabs a branch, snaps it off the tree. She comes at them with 
          this makeshift stake -- nails one in the chest. 
        <p>The other flees. 
        <p>Willow runs up to XANDER, cradles his head. He is just coming to. 
        <center>
          WILLOW<br/>
          Xander, are you okay? 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            Man... something hit me... 
        </p></center>
<p>Buffy is still looking around, unsatisfied. 
        <center>
          BUFFY<br/>
          Where's Jesse? 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            I don't know -- they surrounded us -- he was really weak... 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            That girl grabbed him. Took off. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Which way? 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            I don't know. 
        </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Buffy looks into the night. The camera CIRCLES her as she looks around. 
          There is nothing to see. 
        <p>

<td width="90%"> INT. THE LIBRARY - MORNING 
        <p>We open on a Globe. As we hear GILES begin to SPEAK, we PAN over to 
          Xander and Willow, sitting in the middle of the library. Neither of 
          them appears to have slept since last night. 
        <p>
<center>
            GILES (O.S.)<br/>
            This world is older than any of you know, and<br/>
            contrary to popular mythology, it did not begin<br/>
            as a paradise. For untold eons, Demons walked the<br/>
            earth; made it their home... their Hell. 
          </center>
<p>Still we PAN, to find Giles on the upper level, standing at the railing. 
          His expression is as grave as theirs. 
        <center>
          GILES<br/>
          In time they lost their purchase on this reality,<br/>
          and the way was made for the mortal animals. For<br/>
          Man. What remains of the Old Ones are vestiges:<br/>
          Certain magicks, certain creatures... 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            And vampires... 
        </p></center>
<p>She emerges from Giles' office, wrapping a bandage around her forearm. 
          Xander rises, agitated. 
        <center>
          XANDER<br/>
          Okay, this is where I have a problem, see,<br/>
          because we're now talking about vampires. We're<br/>
          having a talk with vampires in it. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            Oooh... I need to sit down. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            You are sitting down. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            Oh. Good for me. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            So vampires are demons? 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            The books tell that the last Demon to leave this<br/>
            reality fed off a human, mixed their blood. He<br/>
            was a human form possessed -- infected -- by the<br/>
            Demon's soul. He bit another, and another... and<br/>
            so they walk the earth, feeding. Killing some,<br/>
            mixing their blood with others to make more of<br/>
            their kind. Waiting for the animals to die out,<br/>
            and the Old Ones to return. 
        </p></p></p></p></p></center>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. A TUNNEL - MORNING 
        <p>Not that you could see whether it was morning or night in this place 
          -- it remains as dark and humid as the earth that swallowed it. 
        <p>JESSE is being dragged through the tunnel by Luke, DARLA, by his side. 
          Jesse is still staggering into consciousness, and the more he awakens, 
          the less he likes it. 
        <p>He looks about in fear at the two inhuman faces, at the end of the 
          tunnel they are dragging him through. It seems to be an old cracked 
          pipe, and it ends at: 
        <p>INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS 
        <p>Coming out of the pipe, the threesome makes its way down a pile of 
          rocks to the floor of the wrecked church. 
        <p>Jesse looks about, wonder tingeing the edges of his fear. He is stood 
          before the altar, before the pool of blood. 
        <p>From the darkness, something moves. Emerges. 
        <p>THE MASTER regards his servants, his total authority obvious to all. 
          He looks at Jesse. 
        <center>
          THE MASTER<br/>
          Is this for me? 
          <p>LUKE<br/>
            An offering, Master. 
          <p>DARLA<br/>
            He's a good one. His blood is pure. 
          <p>THE MASTER<br/>
            (quietly -- almost innocuously)<br/>
            You've tasted it. 
        </p></p></p></center>
<p>Darla starts back a step, afraid. 
        <center>
          THE MASTER<br/>
          (smiling)<br/>
          I'm your faithful dog. You bring me scraps. 
          <p>DARLA<br/>
            I didn't mean to -- 
          <p>THE MASTER I've waited. For three score years I have waited.<br/>
            While you come and go I have been stuck here,<br/>
            (voice rising)<br/>
            here, in a house of worship. My ascension is<br/>
            almost at hand. Pray that when it comes... I'm in<br/>
            a better mood. 
          <p>DARLA<br/>
            Master, forgive me. We had more offerings but<br/>
            there was trouble. A girl. 
          <p>LUKE<br/>
            There was a girl. She fought well, and she knew <br/>
            of our breed. It's possible that she may be... 
        </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>The Master turns to him. 
        <p>
<center>
            THE MASTER<br/>
            A Slayer?

<p>INT. THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 
        <center>
          XANDER<br/>
          And that would be a what? 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            As long as there have been vampires, there has<br/>
            been the Slayer. One girl in all the world -- 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            He loves doing this part. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            (speeding up)<br/>
            All right: They hunt vampires, one Slayer dies,<br/>
            the next is called, Buffy is the Slayer, don't<br/>
            tell anyone. I think that's all the vampire <br/>
            information you need. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            Except for one thing. How do you kill them? 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            You don't. I do. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            Well, Jesse -- 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Jesse's my responsibility. I let him get taken. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            That's not true. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            If you hadn't showed up, they would have... taken<br/>
            us too... Does anybody mind if I pass out. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Breathe... 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            Breathe. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Breathe.<br/>
            (to Giles)<br/>
            This big guy, Luke, he talked about an offering<br/>
            to the Master. I don't know who or what, but if<br/>
            they weren't just feeding, Jesse may still be<br/>
            alive. I'm gonna find him. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            This is probably the dumb question, but shouldn't<br/>
            we call the police? 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            Do you think they'd believe us? 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            We don't have to say vampires. We could say there<br/>
            was... a bad man. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            They couldn't handle it if they did come. They'd<br/>
            only show up with guns. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            (to Buffy)<br/>
            You've no idea where they took Jesse? 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            I looked around, but... soon as they got clear of<br/>
            the woods they could have just<br/>
            (indicating flight)<br/>
            --whoom. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            They can <b>fly</b>? 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            They can drive. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            Oh. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            I don't remember hearing a car... 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            Well, let's take an enormous intuitive leap and<br/>
            say they went underground. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Vampires really jam on sewer systems. You can get<br/>
            anywhere in town without catching any rays. I<br/>
            didn't see any access around there, though. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            Well, there's electrical tunnels. They run under<br/>
            the whole town. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            If we had a diagnostic of the tunnel system, it<br/>
            might indicate a meeting place. I suppose we<br/>
            could go to the building commission -- 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            We so don't have time. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            Uh, guys? There may be another way. 
        </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>

            Only that she fought me and yet lives. 
          <p>THE MASTER<br/>
            Very nearly proof enough. I can't remember the<br/>
            last time that happened. 
          <p>LUKE<br/>
            1843, in Madrid. And the bastard caught me<br/>
            sleeping. 
          <p>THE MASTER<br/>
            She mustn't be allowed to interfere with the<br/>

          <p>LUKE<br/>
            I would never let that happen.

            You needn't worry. I believe she'll come to us.<br/>
            We have something that she wants. If she is a<br/>

            enough. Understatement. I thought I was on top of<br/>

            I got out. God, I'm so mentally challenged!

            So, what's the plan? We saddle up, right?

            I knew you were gonna throw that in my face.

            Xander, this is deeply dangerous.

            I'm inadequate. That's fine. I'm less than a man.

            Buffy, I'm not anxious to go into a dark place<br/>
            full of monsters, but I do want to help. I need<br/>
            to. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            Then help me. I've been researching this Harvest<br/>
            affair. Seems to be some sort of pre-ordained<br/>
            massacre. Rivers of blood, Hell on earth... Quite <br/>
            charmless. I am fuzzy on the details, however,<br/>
            and it may be that you can wrest some information<br/>
            from that dread machine.<br/>
            (off their uncomprehending looks)<br/>
            That was a bit British, wasn't it? 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Welcome to the new world. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            (translates to Willow)<br/>
            I want you to go on the Net. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            Oh! Yeah. Sure. I can do that. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Then I'm out of here.<br/>
            (to Xander and Willow)<br/>
            If Jesse's alive, I'll bring him back.

          MR. FLUTIE<br/>
          And where do we think we're going? 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            We? I? Me? 
          <p>MR. FLUTIE We're not leaving school grounds, are we? 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            No! I'm just ... admiring the fence. This is<br/>
            quality fencework. 
          <p>MR. FLUTIE<br/>
            Because if we were leaving school grounds on our<br/>
            second day at a new school after being kicked out<br/>
            of our old school for delinquent behavior -- do<br/>
            you see where I'm going with this?

            Mr. Giles!

            What? 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            He asked me to get a book for him. From the store<br/>
            'cause I have a free period and I'm a big reader<br/>
            did it mention that on my transcripts?

<p>Mr. Flutie shuts and locks the gate, saying:

          MR. FLUTIE<br/>
          Well, maybe that's how they do things in Britain,<br/>
          they've got that royal family and all kinds of<br/>
          problems. But here at Sunnydale nobody leaves <br/>
          campus while school's in session. Are we clear? 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            We're clear. 
          <p>MR. FLUTIE<br/>
            That's the Buffy Summers I want in my school. The<br/>

<p>Xander doesn't love that information, but he says nothing. Still they 
          progress, until: 
        <p>
<center>
            XANDER<br/>
            Over there. What's that? 
          </center>
<p>He indicates a small, dark side-chamber. Nothing can be seen past the 
          first few inches. 
        <p>They come up to it. Xander pulls out his flashlight, shines it. 
        <p>ANGLE: IN THE CHAMBER 
        <p>A beam of light finds a body, lying face down. It looks like 
        <center>
          XANDER<br/>
          Jesse! 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Oh, no... 
        </p></center>
<p>She starts forward, Xander keeping the light on her. Goes over to the 
          body, reaches out -- 
        <p>and Jesse JUMPS UP, brandishing a pipe. He's about to slam her with 
          it when Xander calls out: 
        <center>
          XANDER<br/>
          Jesse! 
          <p>JESSE<br/>
            (stops, amazed)<br/>
            Xander? 
        </p></center>
<p>He drops the pipe and the two friends hug. Xander pulls away, looking 
          him over. 
        <center>
          XANDER<br/>
          Jesse, man, are you okay? 
          <p>JESSE<br/>
            I'm not okay on an epic scale. We gotta get out<br/>
            of here! 
        </p></center>
<p>He indicates his leg -- he's been chained to the wall. 
        <p>
<center>
            XANDER<br/>
            It's cool! Buffy's a superhero! 
          </center>
<p>The superhero frowns at the chain, feels it. 
        <p>
<center>
            BUFFY<br/>
            (to Jesse)<br/>
            Hold on. 
          </center>
<p>She takes the pipe he dropped and SMASHES the look on his shackles. 
          It's not a quiet operation. 
        <p>
<center>
            XANDER<br/>
            You think anybody heard that? 
          </center>
<p>ANGLE: A TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 
        <p>A few black shapes move in the shadows, hearing it. 
        <p>ANGLE: BUFFY AND THE OTHERS 
        <p>They start out. 
        <center>
          JESSE<br/>
          They knew you were gonna come. They said that I - <br/>
          I was the bait... 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            Oh, now you tell us. 
          <p>JESSE<br/>
            I've seen their leader. 
        </p></p></center>
<p>The look in his eyes describes their leader in detail. 
        <p>Buffy leads the two boys back through the tunnel. She stops. 
        <p>Shadows move at the other end. 
        <center>
          BUFFY<br/>
          Oops. 
          <p>JESSE<br/>
            Oh, no, no... 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Do you know another way out? 
          <p>JESSE<br/>
            I don't, uh, maybe? 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            Come on. 
        </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They truck out the other way.

<p>INT. A JUNCTION OF TUNNELS - A SECOND LATER 
        <p>They come into this one, moving at a good clip. Try one avenue -- 
        <p>Eyes gleam in the dark. Whispered LAUGHS drift at us. 
        <p>They turn back, pause at a fork. 
        <p>
<center>
            JESSE<br/>
            Wait, wait. They brought me through here! There's<br/>
            a way up. I hope.

        <p>There is no door. There is no exit. Buffy and Xander look about them, 
          frantically.

            BUFFY<br/>
            I don't think this is the way out.

<p>She goes back to the doorway they came in, listens for the approaching 
          vampires.

          XANDER<br/>
          We can't fight our way back through those<br/>

          <p>JESSE<br/>
            I've got an idea...

<p>And the CAMERA PANS over to Jesse standing right behind Xander. His 
          visage grotesque, his smile icy. He's a vampire.

        <p>Xander backs away from Jesse. Buffy looks from him to the entrance, 
          not sure what to do. 
        <p>ANGLE: THE ENTRANCE 
        <p>We HEAR approaching vampires, see shadows begin to move, thrown on 
          the outer wall by figures down the hall. 
        <center>
          XANDER<br/>
          Jesse... Man, I'm sorry... 
          <p>JESSE<br/>
            Sorry? I feel good, Xander. I feel strong. 
        </p></center>
<p>Buffy grabs the door, tries to close it. But it's tick metal, rusted 
          open. 
        <center>
          JESSE<br/>
          I'm connected, man. To everything. I can hear the <br/>
          worms in the earth. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            Well, that's a plus. 
          <p>JESSE<br/>
            I know what the Master wants. I'll serve his<br/>
            purpose. That means you die. And I feed. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Xander! The cross! 
        </p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander holds it up -- and Jesse stops coming toward him. The smiles 
          leaves his face. 
        <p>Buffy continues trying to shut the door -- it's beginning to budge. 
          But coming down the hall are: 
        <p>ANGLE: THE VAMPIRES 
        <p>Making their way down the hall to the door. They most slowly, grinning 
          -- sure of victory. 
        <center>
          XANDER<br/>
          Jesse. Man, we're buds. Can't you remember? 
          <p>JESSE<br/>
            You're like a shadow to me now. 
        </p></center>
<p>Xander moves forward, cross in hand. 
        <p>
<center>
            XANDER<br/>
            Then get out of my face. 
          </center>
<p>Jesse stumbles back, pissed. Xander backs him toward the door. 
        <p>Buffy continues to strain. The vampires approach. 
        <p>Jesse lashes out, knocks the cross from Xander's grasp. He grins -- 
          and then Buffy grabs him from behind and HURLS him out of the room, 
          knocking vampires over like bowling pins. 
        <p>
<center>
            BUFFY<br/>
            Help me! 
          </center>
<p>Xander snaps out of his shock and comes to the door with her. With 
          both their backs to it, they slam it shut -- 
        <p>--an arm SHOOTS in, grasping for them. Buffy opens the door slightly 
          and slams it again till the arm withdraws. She bolts the door, breathing 
          heavily. 
        <p>
<center>
            XANDER<br/>
            I can't believe it... we were too late. 
          </center>
<p>A resounding THUD shudders the door. The vampires are gonna break it 
          down. 
        <center>
          BUFFY<br/>
          We need to get out of here. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            There <u>is</u> no out of here! 
        </p></center>
<p>Another THUD and the door begins to buckle on its hinges. Buffy looks 
          around -- there is some junk lying around. She throws it out of the 
          way to see if there is a doorway behind it. No joy. 
        <p>Xander also looks around. He spies: 
        <p>ANGLE: AN AIR VENT 
        <p>We can see just a hint of an air vent's grating behind a metal sheet. 
          It's high up in the shadows. 
        <p>
<center>
            XANDER<br/>
            What's that? 
          </center>
<p>Buffy sees it too. She throws a box down, steps on it to reach the 
          vent. Pulls away the metal sheet, revealing the grate. It's big enough 
          to climb through. 
        <p>She begins trying to pry the grate open with her bare hands. 
        <p>Another THUD. Xander looks from Buffy to the door. 
        <p>Buffy pulls, behind a corner. 
        <p>The door comes off its hinges enough for a vampire to put his fingers 
          through, grip it. 
        <p>Buffy RIPS the grating loose, throws it aside. 
        <p>
<center>
            BUFFY<br/>
            Come on! 
          </center>
<p>And a vampire SHOOTS out of the air vent at her, grabbing her head. 
        <p>The door comes out enough for a vampire to get its face in. 
        <p>Buffy pulls the vampire all the way out of the vent, throws it to the 
          floor. Jumps down on top of it. 
        <p>

            BUFFY<br/>
            (to Xander)<br/>
            Go! 
          </center>
<p>He runs by, climbs on the box as Buffy sinks a stake into the vampire's 
          back. He sticks the flashlight in: 
        <p>ANGLE: IN THE AIR VENT 
        <p>Nothing. Clear. 
        <p>He crawls in, starts worming his way down it. 
        <p>ANGLE: THE DOOR 
        <p>Breaks down. Vampires pile in. 
        <p>Buffy jumps up and pulls herself into the air vent.

        <p>The two of them crawl along in the dark, the vampires at their heels. 
        <p>They come to a wider space, with a ladder going up. Sunlight can be 
          seen through the grating at the very top.

          Up?

          is almost out when 
        <p>ANGLE: A HAND 
        <p>grabs her ankle, starts pulling her back down. 
        <p>She pulls up, bringing the hand up into the sunlight. It beings to 
          SMOKE -- we hear a SHRIEK and it is withdrawn. 
        <p>Buffy rolls out, slams the grating shut. 
        <p>For a moment both of them just lie there, catching their breath.

<p>She sits, shows him copied articles as she talks.

          WILLOW<br/>
          I think maybe. I looked through the old papers,<br/>
          around the time of that big earthquake back in<br/>
          '37. And for several months before it, there was<br/>
          a rash of murders. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            Great! I mean, not great in a good way... Go on. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            They sound like the kind you were looking for.<br/>
            Throats, blood. Months, and not even a clue. 
          <p>GILES<br/>

        <p>We see a candle being lit, the last of a row. Darla steps back from 
          it, the taper in her hand glowing softly. 
        <p>As she does, another vampire does the same on the opposite wall. They 
          are at the back of the church, staring ahead. The rows of candles run 
          up to the altar, where the Master stands waiting. 
        <p>CHANTING can be heard, a low, primal whisper. 
        <p>Luke steps forward, pulling off his shirt. He steps forward, kneels 
          before the Master. The Master holds out his hand. Luke leans forward 
          and kisses it. The Master turn him open palm up and Luke kisses that 
          as well. Gently, Luke takes the Master's wrist in his hand, brings his 
          lips to that as well. 
        <p>And bites it. 
        <p>The Master winces, shuts his eyes. Luke feeds for a few moments, the

          XANDER<br/>
          I don't like vampires. I'm gonna take a stand and<br/>
          say they're not good. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            So, Giles, you got anything that can make this<br/>
            day worse? 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            How about the end of the world. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            I knew I could count on you. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            This is what we know. Some sixty years ago a very<br/>
            old, very powerful vampire came to this shore,<br/>
            and not just to feed. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            He came 'cause this town is a mystical whoosit? 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            Yes. The Spanish who first settled here called it<br/>
            Boca Del Infierno -- roughly translated:<br/>
            Hellmouth. A sort of portal from this reality to<br/>
            the next. This vampire hoped to open it. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Bring the demons back. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            End of the world. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            But he blew it. Or, I mean, there was an<br/>
            earthquake that swallowed about half the town.<br/>
            And him too -- or at least there were no more<br/>
            vampire-type killings after. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            Opening dimensional portals is tricky business.<br/>
            Odds are he got himself stuck. Like a cork in a<br/>
            bottle. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            And this Harvest thing is to get him out? 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            It comes once in a century, on this night. A<br/>
            Master can draw power from one of his minions<br/>
            while it feeds. Enough power to break free, and<br/>
            to open the portal. The minion is called the<br/>
            Vessel, and he bears this symbol. 
        </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He shows them a sketch of the three-pointed star.

          Harvest.

            Simply put, yes. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Any clue where this little get-together is being<br/>
            held?

        <p>The last rays are streaming in as Buffy enters, starts going through 
          her closet.

            Buffy?

<p>Buffy's mom, JOYCE SUMMERS, enters. Buffy keeps going through her clothes, 
          picking out a good slaying outfit. 
        <center>
          JOYCE<br/>
          You're going out? 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            I have to. 
          <p>JOYCE<br/>
            I didn't hear you come in last night. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            I was quiet. 
          <p>JOYCE<br/>
            It's happening again, isn't it?

<p>Buffy stops, looks at her. 
        <center>
          JOYCE<br/>
          I got a call from your new principal. Says you<br/>
          missed some classes today. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            I was... running an errand. 
        </p></center>
<p>She pulls an old trunk out of her closet. She opens it, starts going 
          through it. 
        <center>
          JOYCE<br/>
          We haven't finished unpacking and I'm getting<br/>

          No.

            This is important. 
          <p>JOYCE<br/>
            I know. You have to go out or it'll be the end of<br/>
            the world. Everything is life or death when<br/>
            you're a sixteen year old girl. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Mom, I don't have time to talk about it-- 
          <p>JOYCE<br/>
            You've got all night, Buffy. You're not going<br/>
            anywhere. Now you can stay up here and sulk if<br/>
            you want. I won't hold it against you. But if you<br/>
            want to come down, I'll make us some dinner.

<p>Joyce leaves, closing the door quietly but firmly behind her. After 
          a moment, Buffy reaches into the truck. 
        <p>ANGLE: IN THE TRUNK 
        <p>Girl stuff, memorabilia, <u>Teen Beat</u> magazines. 
        <p>Buffy reaches in and lifts out the inside -- the trunk has a false 
          bottom. Below it stakes, crosses, host, garlic, and a widemouthed jar 
          of holy water. 
        <p>Buffy takes out a particularly deadly looking stake. It fits in her 
          hand like it's part of it. She stuffs it into a bag, along with a few 
          other items. 
        <p>She stands, goes to the door. Listens by it. 
        <p>She gets to the window, opens it. Starts crawling out.

            Senior boys are the only way to go. They're just<br/>

            Forget about it. They're children. Like Jesse -- <br/>
            did you see him last night? The way he follows me<br/>
            around... He's like a little puppy dog: you just<br/>
            want to put him to sleep. Senior boys have<br/>

        <p>Jesse makes his way slowly through the crowd, not towards but around 
          her, his eyes never leaving her. She sees him too -- and for the first 
          time, doesn't look away in disgust. There's something different about 
          him. 
        <p>A SLOW SONG starts playing, and Cordelia stops dancing, heads off the

          the face, and she skids into the corner, badly hurt. The stake falls 
          at his feet. 
        <p>ANGLE: DOOR TO BACKSTAGE 
        <p>It bursts open, Xander nearly falling out. 
        <p>He looks about him -- no vampires in the immediate vicinity -- and 
          beings herding people out.

        <p>Buffy kicks Luke in the chest. He flies back, landing hard. She's about 
          to go in for the kill when she sees. 
        <p>ANGLE: A VAMPIRE 
        <p>going for Xander, who's too busy shepherding people out to notice. 
        <p>Buffy turns to the drum kit and <b>kicks</b> the cymbal right off the 
          stand. She catches it in mid air -- 
        <p>--the vampire reaches Xander, grabs him-- 
        <p>--Buffy hurls the cymbal, frisbee style-- 
        <p>--the vampire turns, eyes wide, and <b>the cymbal flies straight at

<p>ANGLE: BUFFY 
        <p>barely has time to turn before Luke GRABS her from behind, lifting 
          her up in a crushing bear hug. 
        <p>ANGLE: XANDER 
        <p>He is going to help Buffy when he hears a SHRIEK, turns and sees: 
        <p>ANGLE: CORDELIA 
        <p>is being dragged off into the area below the stairs by Jesse. 
        <p>He throws her to the ground, kneeling above her. Pinning her.

            JESSE<br/>
            Hold still! You're not helping. 
          </center>
<p>Xander appears behind Jesse, holding a stake. He could plunge it right 
          through the back into the heart, but he hesitates. 
        <p>
<center>
            XANDER<br/>
            Jesse, man... don't make me do it.

<p>Jesse looks around, grinning inhumanly.

<p>He heads for the door to the main room and <b>Darla JUMPS on him</b>, 
          digging for his throat. His stake is knocked out of his hand as he topples 
          to the ground.

          Jesse, I know there's still a part of you in<br/>

          <p>JESSE<br/>
            (exasperated)<br/>
            Okay, let's deal with this. Jesse was an <br/>
            excruciating loser who couldn't get a date with <br/>
            anyone in the sighted community! Look at me now!<br/>
            I'm a new man! 
        </p></center>
<p>He grabs Xander and HURLS him against the wall. Xander falls in a heap 
          to the cowering Cordelia.

            BUFFY<br/>
            How'd it taste? 
          </center>
<p>She is weak, despite her bravado. She grabs the cymbal stand, holds 
          it as a weapon. Looks around her -- and sees: 
        <p>ANGLE: THE WINDOW 
        <p>at the back of the stage. It's painted black, one huge pane. 
        <p>Buffy looks at it, at Luke. 
        <p>ANGLE: XANDER 
        <p>Jesse picks him up again, fury etching his demon face. 
        <p>
<center>
            JESSE<br/>
            I'm sick of you getting in the way, you know?<br/>
            Cordelia, she's gonna live forever. You're not.

        <p>She swings the cymbal stand at an approaching Luke. He smiles.

          You forget. Metal can't hurt me.

            There's something you forgot about, too.

            It's in about nine hours, moron.

          she turns her gaze slowly toward the vampires. 
        <p>They look at the expression on her face for about 1/8th of a second, 
          then they drop Xander and bolt out of the front door.

<p>EXT. FOUNTAIN QUAD - DAY 
        <p>Everything is exactly the same. We see kids milling about, talking, 
          laughing in the bright sunshine. Pick up Cordelia, walking by with her 
          friends. 
        <center>
          CORDELIA<br/>
          Well, I heard it was rival gangs. Anyway, Buffy<br/>
          totally knew these guys which is too weird. I<br/>
          can't remember anything too well, but I'm telling<br/>
          you, it was a freak show. 
          <p>GIRL<br/>
            Oh, I wish I'd been there.

<p>And we leave them, picking up Buffy and the others nearby, crossing 
          the other way. Xander has a look of disbelief on his face.

          BUFFY<br/>
          Well, what exactly were you expecting? 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            I don't know! Something. The dead rose! We<br/>
            should've at least had an assembly. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            People have a tendency to rationalize what they<br/>
            can, and forget what they can't. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Believe me, I've seen it happen. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            Well, I'll never forget it. None of it. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            Good. Next time you'll be prepared. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            Next time? 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            Next time is why? 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            We stopped the master from freeing himself and<br/>
            opening the mouth of Hell. Doesn't mean he'll<br/>
            stop trying. I'd say the fun is just beginning. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            More vampires? 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            Not just vampires. The next creature we face may<br/>
            be something quite different. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            I can hardly wait. 
          <p>GILES<br/>
            We're at a center of mystical convergence here.<br/>
            We may in fact stand between the earth and total<br/>
            destruction. 
          <p>XANDER<br/>
            Buffy, this isn't good. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I<br/>
            can still get kicked out of school. 
        </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She smiles at Giles and starts off, the other two keeping up with her. 
        <center>
          XANDER<br/>
          Hey, that's a plan. 'Cause a lot of schools <br/>
          aren't on Hellmouths. 
          <p>WILLOW<br/>
            Maybe you could blow something up. They're really <br/>
            strict about that. 
          <p>BUFFY<br/>
            I was aiming for a subtle approach, like<br/>
            excessive not studying.

<p>Giles watches them go, an uneasy smile plastered on his lips.
