<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ, and DEVON are finishing a song on stage. 
      BUFFY and WILLOW sit at a table and talk as another band plays.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You know what else I love 
      about college? <br/>How when the professor comes in, the <br/>class gets all 
      quiet.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh I hate that. I'm always 
      like, what? <br/>Did something scary come in? <br/>Do I have to kill 
      it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Something catches Willow's eye.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hey look, Parker's 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER is by the pool table, behind Buffy. 
      She doesn't look.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(disinterested)<br/>Yeah?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You're not looking? He's 
      really <br/>cute in green.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Blue. <br/>(caught)<br/>He's, 
      uh, reflected in that mirror.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>That's nice. You know, when 
      you spend <br/><u>all week</u> with a boy, you are allowed <br/>to look at 
      him directly.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Not all week. We've hung out. 
      <br/>Moderately incessantly. But we're <br/>not here together, and I don't 
      want <br/>to crowd him.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's been looking at Parker the whole 
      time. Oz joins them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>You guys ready to load up and 
      go?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Almost. Buffy's looking at 
      Parker. <br/>Who, it turns out, has a reflection, <br/>so, big plus 
      there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow points him out for Oz.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Good looking guy. Works out. 
      <br/>(off their looks)<br/>I have eyes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Buffy's having lusty wrong 
      feelings.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No I'm not.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Wait. No you're 
      not.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm not? Oh, I so 
      am.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No, they're not wrong 
      feelings. <br/>'Cause there's no wrong. You're <br/>free. You're both 
      grown-ups... <br/>You <u>are</u> free, right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well, 
      sure.<br/>(realizing)<br/>Yeah. I really feel like I am, like I'm 
      <br/>over... everything else. High school stuff.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A hand lands lightly on Buffy's shoulder. 
      She follows it up to a smiling Parker.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Hi.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He gives Willow and Oz quick nods, but he's 
      all about Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>I just wanted to say, I'm 
      heading out. <br/>And it's not real safe around here, so, <br/>if you need a 
      walk back to your dorm...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Guess I was kinda silly, not 
      planning ahead...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Don't worry about it. So... 
      you <br/>ready to go?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Absolutely.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Parker head through the crowd 
      toward the door and Buffy flashes a hopeful smile back at 
      Willow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. BRONZE LOADING DOCK - MINUTES LATER 
      (NIGHT)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow, Oz and Devon load the band's stuff 
      into Oz' van.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEVON<br/>That was, like, the best set 
      ever. <br/>We'll do great in L.A. We'll have <br/>'em glued to their 
      seats.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Um... Devon? Aren't they 
      supposed <br/>to dance?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>We could glue them to the dance 
      floor.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz and Devon head into the Bronze for 
      another load of stuff.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEVON<br/>(to Oz, as they exit)<br/>I 
      didn't mean with real glue. <br/>You got that, right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow is alone now, stuffing Oz' guitar 
      case into the van.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY 
      (O.S.)<br/>Willow?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow turns, startled. HARMONY is 
      there.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Harmony! I haven't seen you 
      since...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Since graduation. Big snake, 
      huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yeah. So how was your 
      summer?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>I was going to go to France. 
      But I <br/>didn't. I was dying to see the stores.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Ooh. And 
      museums.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Museums?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I heard they have 'em. Little 
      rumors <br/>you pick up on the street.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>You're always so funny, 
      Willow. <br/>You haven't changed a bit.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No, you 
      either.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Oh, maybe a 
      little.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Suddenly Harmony MORPHS into VAMP FACE and 
      grabs Willow, about to plunge her fangs into Willow's tender 
      neck.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow is helpless in Harmony's grasp. A 
      fang nicks Willow's throat and a thin trickle of blood spills out. Harmony 
      GROWLS in pleasure. Then something metal SLAMS down between her and 
      Willow. Oz is back, using a mic stand to catch Harmony by the throat and 
      pull her off Willow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony WHIRLS, turning on Oz. But Willow 
      steps between them, pulling a cross from her pack.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Back off, 
      Harmony.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz takes the cross from Willow, holds it out 
      to protect both of them. Harmony SNARLS at the cross and backs

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Okay, fine. Hide behind your

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony runs away. Devon comes out, arms

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hobbies?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Yeah, hobbies. Interests. I 
      feel like there's <br/>so much I still don't know about you. <br/>What do 
      you like to do?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well, mostly I... you know, 
      hang out <br/>and do stuff.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Yeah, I was into that for a 
      while.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's looking at her, notices the scar on her 
      neck.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER (cont'd)<br/>What's 
      that?</font></center>
<p></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What's what?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>You have a 
      scar.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He touches her neck, rubs over Angel's bite 
      scar with his thumb. Buffy shivers at the intimacy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh. Right. Angry 
      puppy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Parker smiles, and finally, reluctantly, 
      takes his hand away.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>So do I get to see 
      any of <u>your</u> scars?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Oh, mine are all 
      psychological.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Please, they're the best 
      kind.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Well, my father died last 
      year.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh, Parker. God, I'm sorry, I 
      didn't <br/>mean to bring up something like that. <br/>Bad, bad 
      Buffy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>No, no, I'm okay to talk 
      about it now. <br/>And I'm not doing the deep "get sympathy" <br/>routine. 
      Don't you hate guys that are all <br/>"I'm dark and brooding so give me 
      love"?<br/><br/>BUFFY<br/>I... I've never met that type.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>I just wanted to say that the 
      thing that <br/>made it so sad was that there was a lot <br/>of stuff he 
      didn't get to finish. Like, <br/>he thought there'd always be this future 
      <br/>out there, and then there wasn't. <br/>It's made me think about, you 
      know, <br/>living for now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I think about that sometimes. 
      A lot, <br/>actually. How fast it could end? <br/>See, I sort of, drowned 
      once, a couple <br/>of years ago. And I came back. 
      Obviously.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Wow. I mean, you hear about 
      stuff <br/>like that...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah, well, pool safety, 
      important. <br/>Anyway, I don't put things off anymore. <br/>Like you were 
      saying.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>That's great. Everyone says 
      they get it: <br/>"oh, man, me too, live for today," but <br/>what they 
      really want is an excuse to <br/>goof off and not study for 
      finals.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Also a valid life 
      choice.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>It's cool to find someone 
      else who <br/>understands.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>So, when you go to bed 
      tonight, what <br/>are you going to regret not doing today?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>I'm going to regret being too 
      nervous to <br/>ask you to the party at Wolf House <br/>tomorrow night. Do 
      you want to go <br/>to the party at Wolf --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yes.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He slips his hand into Buffy's 
      hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Buffy? When you... drowned, 
      whoever <br/>brought you back? they're getting a big <br/>kiss from 
      me.</font></center>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There's a knock at the door. Giles goes to

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I-- I-- we have a

<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Yes. On our one and only 
      date. Second <br/>date called on account of snake, remember? <br/>And, 
      there's the whole you-used-to-be-a-<br/>man-killing-demon thing, which, to 
      be <br/>fair, is as much my issue as it is yours...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>I can't stop thinking about

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>So can I assume a standing 
      Friday night <br/>date and mutual recognition of prom night <br/>as our 
      dating anniversary?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Anya, slow down. In fact, 
      come to a <br/>screeching halt. This is just, I'd say it's <br/>out of 
      nowhere, but that doesn't really <br/>capture the amount of nowhere which 
      <br/>it's out of. See, these things kind of <br/>have to develop on their

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony wanders to the edge of the lair, 
      where a young man, barely conscious, is chained to the wall. He bears the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike's had enough. He comes over to 
      Harmony, grabs her and shoves her up against the side of the tunnel. He 
      doesn't vamp-face, but he SNARLS. Harmony giggles.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY (cont'd)<br/>Ooh. Right here,

<p></p>

      after a party.</font></center>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Parker enter the party. It's 
      crowded, dark, smoky and loud. One guy is doing a funnel. A couple is 
      propped up next to the door, making out vigorously. Buffy tries not to 
      stare. Parker puts a protective arm around Buffy, guiding her through the 
      crowd.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Watch out. You can take 
      pictures, but <br/>stay in the safari truck at all times.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Parker leads her through the living room, 
      past groups of students laughing and talking. Buffy takes it all in. A guy 
      is showing off for his friends by drunkenly juggling beer bottles. A 
      passed-out girl slumps on one of the sofas.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER (cont'd)<br/>(shouted over 
      music)<br/>Some party, huh? The last days of Rome.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(shouted back)<br/>Better. No 
      old Romans.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>(shouted)<br/>You wanna 
      dance?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(shouted)<br/>Let's have a 
      meaningful talk instead.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Parker laughs, leads Buffy past the keg, 
      where people are lined up to get beer. Behind them, the sound of beer 
      bottles crashing to the floor: that was a bad juggler. Buffy and Parker 
      end up by the dance floor. A live band plays and couples dance wildly. 
      Parker leads Buffy onto the floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As they head onto the floor, they collide 
      with a couple supporting a drunken friend between them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks closer. It's Harmony and Spike, 
      and the "drunken friend" is a stunned and lacerated victim. Spike and 
      Buffy freeze, look at each other and their dates, sizing up the sitch. The 
      song ends, making conversation possible.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Spike. 
      Harmony.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Buffy. Hi. What a cute 
      outfit, last year.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Well, this is interesting. 
      Sort of a <br/>double date.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I think you two should 
      go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>But the fun's just starting: 
      old friends, <br/>lots to drink...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike jiggles the victim as he says "lots to 
      drink."</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Looks like your friend there 
      started the <br/>party a little early, huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike looks at Parker, but talks to 
      Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Say, let's have a look at the 
      new boy. <br/>Hmm. I like him. He's got, what's the <br/>word, 
      vulnerability.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Parker is confused, but trying to go 
      along:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Hi, I'm 
      Parker...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Parker holds out his hand, Spike ignores 
      it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And you, with Harmony. Lose a 
      bet?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Hey!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Actually, how we met, funny 
      story, really--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Trying for surprise, he dumps the victim 
      onto Parker and runs into the crowd. Buffy dives after him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(to Parker)<br/>I'll be right 
      back!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But the music has started again and it's 
      hard to hear her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy bursts out the door onto the front 
      porch of the party house. It's a little quieter here. Students cluster 
      around, smoking and talking. She steps off the porch, warily. She pulls 
      out a stake and walks around to the side of the house. It's dark and 
      deserted here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She passes a dark shadow along the side of 
      the house, then she WHIRLS and PUNCHES into the shadow. Spike punches 
      back, steps out into the dim light. Harmony runs up, out of 
      breath.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Dru dump you 
      again?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy punches.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Maybe <u>I</u> dumped 
      <u>her</u> --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike punches back.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>She left him for a Fungus 
      Demon. <br/>It's all he talks about some days...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Harm. We're

      soon as we have the Gem <br/>of Amarra you're gonna be sooo sorry - 
      <br/>Ow!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike grabs Harmony to shut her up, drags 
      her off by the arm. Buffy starts after them, but they're back around the 
      front of the house, pushing through a group of party arrivals. Buffy gets 
      tangled in the crowd. Spike and Harmony get away.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander is decorating his basement 
      "apartment." It came with wood paneling, a washer and drying and his dad's 
      old work bench. Xander has added posters and a mini-fridge, and he is 
      balanced on a ladder, trying to attach a disco ball to the unfinished 
      ceiling. There is a KNOCK at the outside door.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Come in!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anya enters.</font></p>

      How'd you find me here?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Your mother sent me around from 
      the <br/>front of the house. She also said to ask <br/>you to add fabric 
      softener when the timer <br/>goes off. Can we talk some 
      more?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander climbs down.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Yeah, I s'pose. So... you're 
      my first guest <br/>at Casa del Xander -- not the final name, <br/>still 
      working on it. You want something? <br/>I've got Cranapple.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>All right.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He turns to his mini-fridge and grabs a 
      juice box. He puts the straw in and turns back to her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You know, it's customary to 
      call before <br/>you show up, not that --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Her dress is pooled around her feet. She 
      stands naked. His hand convulses and Cranapple shoots out his

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Music from the nearby party house is faintly

      booth.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah, Spike. With Harmony, if 
      you <br/>can believe it. I mean, I thought Spike <br/>and Dru were a forever

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(get on with it)<br/>I'm

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>So anyway, I couldn't figure 
      out why <br/>he ran away, but Harmony said something. <br/>What they're here

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah. What's 
      up?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>It's just, it's not real. It's 
      like, like a <br/>vampire version of the Holy Grail. <br/>A source of some 
      kind of enormous <br/>power, always conveniently vague...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's juggling the phone receiver now, 
      reaching a reference book off a shelf, flipping through it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES (cont'd)<br/>Yes, here it is. 
      There was a great deal <br/>of vampyric interest in locating the gem 
      <br/>during, oh, the 10th century. Questing <br/>vampires combed the earth, 
      but no <br/>one found it. It was concluded that it <br/>never 
      existed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well Spike seems to think it 
      exists. <br/>And he's looking in Sunnydale.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I don't see how something that 
      valuable, <br/>if it were real, could remain hidden on a <br/>Hellmouth, 
      with all its demonic activity. <br/>I could probably even track the 
      development <br/>of the myth...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And I'm with you. Myth 
      tracking. I mean, <br/>I don't really need a full eight hours, right? <br/>A 
      little shaky, but that's okay...</font></center>
<p></p>

      Like people <br/>were swept up in events they couldn't <br/>control. But I 
      don't believe that. <br/>You always have a choice. With <br/>everything you

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CRYPT - DAY (DAY 5)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A dark room that brightens as Spike pulls 
      himself up into it, carrying a kerosene lantern. He looks around in awe at 
      the splendor. There is a dead demon here, withered and decayed and brown 
      and crunchy, arrayed in finery on a carved wooden bier.<br/><br/>There are 
      tapestries on the walls, statues and icons everywhere, piles of jewels. In 
      the middle of the demon's chest, looped onto a chain, sits a HUGE GREEN 
      JEWEL.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(awed)<br/>It's 
      real.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike puts down the lamp without taking his 
      eyes off the jewel. It's a solemn and sacred moment as Spike reaches for 
      his grail.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY (O.S.)<br/>Ooooh. Pretty. Can I 
      take stuff?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike jumps, startled, and turns to see 
      Harmony standing inside the crypt, looking around open-mouthed.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Nick whatever you want. I 
      don't care.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She kisses him on the cheek, and he endures 
      it. Bracelets, necklaces, rings, Harmony tries them on one at a time. 
      While she's doing that, Spike reaches for the huge emerald pendant. He 
      strokes its surface reverently. He picks it up, very gently, lets his 
      fingers close around it... and YANKS it off the dead demon. The desiccated 
      body crumbles and the chain pulls through the neck like a knife through a 
      Butterfinger bar, decapitating the demon.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Ew. Like you're too good to 
      work a clasp.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike drapes the chain around his neck, lets 
      the gem rest on his chest, revels in the power of ownership.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMON (cont'd)<br/>You don't look any

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike's looking concerned now. He reaches 
      for an ornamental cross among the pile of loot. It SIZZLES on his hand and 
      he stifles a curse.</font></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Without warning, <u>Spike snaps a jagged

<p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He grabs the cross again, using the end of

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I-- You had fun. Is that all

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>Okay, I'm a little confused 
      now. I mean, <br/>I definitely got the idea you'd done it <br/>before. You 
      were one who was all over <br/>me. It was fun. What else was it 
      <br/>supposed to be?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy shrugs, too embarrassed to say that 
      she thought he was falling in love with her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER (cont'd)<br/>(gentler)<br/>Really. 
      Tell me.<br/><br/>BUFFY<br/>It seemed like you... liked me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>I do. But I'm starting to 
      feel like you <br/>thought that meant, what? Some kind <br/>of commitment? 
      Is that really what <br/>you want right now?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I just thought, you

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PARKER<br/>I'm sorry if you

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CAMPUS - DAY - CONTINUOUS</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The punch sends Buffy to the ground, blood 
      at the corner of her mouth. Dazed, confused and hurting, she feels around 
      her, comes up with a stick to use as a stake. To her surprise, Spike is 
      just watching her get ready and find her feet. He faces her, ready, 
      casual, relaxed.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Innit a fantastic day? Birds 
      singing, <br/>squirrels making lots of rotten little <br/>squirrels, sun 
      beaming down in a nice, <br/>non-fatal way. It's very exciting, I can't 
      <br/>wait to find out if I freckle.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy slams him, a powerhouse punch. He's 
      back up like one of those pop-up clowns, and he gives her as good as he's 
      got. Then he drops his guard, a little too readily, and Buffy manages to 
      STAKE him, pulling it out and waiting for the inevitable. She is stunned 
      when he does not dust.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Ooh. Do it again. It 
      tickles. You know, <br/>in the good way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>The gem.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Oh yeah. The Gem of 
      Amarra.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He holds up his ring hand. Punches her with 
      it. Hard.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Official sponsor of 
      my killing you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He MORPHS and lunges at her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CRYPT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles and Oz finish pulling Willow into the 
      crypt. They look around to find Harmony, sitting pathetically on the 
      floor, sniffling. Giles, Oz and Willow exchange glances, trying to decide 
      what to do. They all take out stakes. Harmony sees them and bursts into 
      fresh tears.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(gently)<br/>Harmony...?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>(gasping through 
      tears)<br/>Being a vampire sucks.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow can't help but feel bad. She takes a 
      step forward, her stake at her side. Suddenly Harmony MORPHS into 
      VAMP-FACE and lunges at Willow. Oz jumps to get between them, and he gets 
      in a good punch, but Harmony is barely shaken. Oz hits her again. She 
      SNARLS and THROWS Oz across the room. Giles tries to sweep Harmony's feet 
      from under her, but she's fast. She knocks him across to where Oz is 
      trying to get to his feet, sending both men down in a tangle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S DORM HALLWAY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander is pounding on Buffy and Willow's

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Buffy!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He gives up and turns to leave, when Anya 
      approaches.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Xander. I've been looking for 
      you. <br/>You weren't in your musty basement.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Have you seen 
      Buffy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>No.<br/>(then, shyly)<br/>About 
      what happened. See, when I <br/>said I was over you--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(didn't hear a 
      word)<br/>Anya-- I don't have time.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He runs off, leaving Anya hurt and 
      confused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CRYPT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles, Willow and Oz stand, stakes in hand, 
      forming a triangle surrounding vamp-faced Harmony. They close 
      in.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Harmony? Where's 
      Spike?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony is at the tunnel entrance, ready to 
      escape.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES (cont'd)<br/>(to Harmony)<br/>Does 
      he have the gem?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She nods.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>He staked me and he took it. 
      Tried to <br/>take it right off my finger. Like I wouldn't <br/>have just 
      give it to him? I'd've given <br/>him anything he wanted. He was my 
      <br/>platinum baby and I loved him.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Where did he 
      go?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Harmony hops down into the tunnel and 
      she's gone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CAMPUS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The fight drags on. Buffy and Spike trade 
      blows and kicks of equal force and skill. It's an unlovely fight -- 
      muscle, not finesse. Buffy is bruised and bleeding.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Getting tired 
      Slayer?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander runs by, sees them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm okay. How 'bout you? Sun 
      in <br/>your eyes?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But she <u>is</u> tired, dropping her fists, 
      breathing hard.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>A little. Awfully bright, 
      disorienting... <br/>oh, no, I lied. I'm fine.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike lands a punch that staggers her. She's 
      slow rejoining the fight. Then she sees Xander. He's creeping up behind 
      Spike. Xander raises a chair over Spike's head, ready to bring it 
      down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Without warning, Spike spins completely 
      around, pulling the chair from Xander's hand and using it to smash Xander 
      in the ribs, sending him to the ground in a helpless heap, out of the 
      fight. Spike continues the spin, ending up facing Buffy again. Things look 
      bad for Buffy. Spike attacks.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>So, you let Parker 
      take a poke, eh? <br/>Didn't seem like you knew each other <br/>that well. 
      What exactly did it take to <br/>pry apart the Slayer's dimpled 
      knees?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You're a pig 
      Spike.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy deflects another blow of 
      Spike's.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Did he play the sensitive lad 
      and get <br/><u>you</u> to seduce <u>him</u>? Good trick if the <br/>girl's 
      thick enough to buy it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She throws a kick but he stops 
it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Wonder what you did 
      wrong. Too <br/>strong? Did you bruise the boy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike manages to catch her with a crushing 
      blow.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Whatever, guess 
      you're not worth a <br/>second go. Come to think of it, seems <br/>like 
      someone told me as much.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And another...</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Who was that? Oh, 
      yeah. Angel.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">When he swings again, she parries the blow 
      with force, throwing him off balance. And as her face rises into frame, 
      transformed by determination, Spike knows he went a bridge too 
      far.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She KICKS the pipe out of his fist. The pipe 
      goes flying, hitting Xander again, who moans. Buffy hits Spike with a 
      dizzying flurry of punches and kicks, the last one sending him down. She 
      JUMPS and lands on his sprawled body, pinning his arms down with her 
      knees, pressing his head into the ground with one hand, twisting his neck. 
      He bucks, but she's pulling at the ring.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Take it off me this 
      way and we both burn!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Really? Let's 
      see.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Audibly breaking a finger in the process, 
      she gets the ring! Spike ROARS in pain and bucks again, in panic, knocking 
      her off. He scrambles up and away, starting to SMOKE AND SIZZLE in the 
      sunlight. He drops into an OPEN MANHOLE and is gone. Buffy sinks to the 
      ground, exhausted. But she holds the ring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - NIGHT (STILL DAY 
      5)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE RING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">sits on Giles' coffee table. Buffy, Giles, 
      Willow, Xander and Oz all look at it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I like it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>It's small.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Quite tasteful. Really worth 
      getting <br/>my ribs bashed in.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>So the question now is, what 
      do we do <br/>with it? It's obviously extremely <br/>dangerous and 
      destroying it--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>We don't destroy 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>But, Buffy, any vampire who 
      gets this <br/>is essentially unkillable... Oh...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz looks at Buffy. He knows what she wants 
      to do with it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I have that gig in L.A. I could 
      swing by.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Thanks, Oz.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>What's going on? What's in 
      L.A.?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(aside to Xander)<br/>She's 
      giving it to Angel. Don't make <br/>a fuss.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Buffy, are you 
      sure?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>He should have 
      this.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CAMPUS - LATER THAT NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Willow walk back toward the 
      dorm.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>So what I'm wondering is, does 
      this <br/>always happen? Sleep with a guy and <br/>he goes all 
      evil?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well, from what I understand, 
      pretty <br/>much. But it won't always be like that. <br/>You've just had 
      some really bad luck.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't know, Will. Bad luck 
      just happens. <br/>I made this happen.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well, why shouldn't you, if 
      it's what <br/>you want? I mean, as long as it's safe. <br/>Oh, Buffy, it 
      was safe, wasn't it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It was safe. It's not that. 
      It's that the <br/>whole time, I kept thinking, hey, look <br/>at me with 
      someone who isn't Angel. <br/>Look how much I'm not hung up on <br/>Angel 
      anymore. Look how this is not <br/><u>all</u> about Angel. God, how come I 
      <br/>didn't see it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well, maybe you made a 
      mistake, but <br/>that's okay. Next time--<br/>(off Buffy's 
      look)<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(sentimental)<br/>Parker said 
      it was okay to make mistakes. <br/>It was sweet.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>No it wasn't. He said that so 
      you'd take <br/>a chance and sleep with him. He's a 
      <br/>poop-head.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know. He's manipulative and 
      shallow <br/>and why doesn't he want me? If there <br/>was something totally 
      repulsive about <br/>me, you'd tell me, right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'm your friend. I'd call you 
      repulsive in a second.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Maybe me and Parker could 
      still work <br/>it out. Do you think we could still work <br/>it 
      out?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You're missing something 
      about the <br/>whole "poop-head" principle.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They're at the dorm. Willow heads inside, 
      Buffy hangs back.</font></p>
<p>
