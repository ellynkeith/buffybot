<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. WOODS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Shadowy and overgrown. Dream-like. Thorough 
      the tangle of bushes and trees - something runs through the night woods. A 
      snarling creature, obscured by darkness. Over this we hear - </font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (V.O.)<br/>One night, after 
      supper, the lead<br/>dog turned up a snowshoe rabbit. The dog<br/>lay down 
      low to the race, his body<br/>flashing forward, leap by leap… he was 
      <br/>sounding the deeps of his nature, and the parts of his<br/>nature that 
      were deeper than he - <br/>going back into the wombs of 
      time….</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Buffy's voice MELDS into WILLOW'S as we 
      - </font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FADE TO: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And find Willow, trying to stay awake, as 
      she walks in front of the book cage, reading aloud from Jack London's 
      "Call of the Wild." A CLOCK ON THE WALL nearby reads 3:17AM.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(reading)<br/>…going back into 
      the wombs of time.<br/>The rabbit could not turn-…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now she is STARTLED by OZ, in full wolf 
      mode, as HE LEAPS into frame behind her - slamming into the cage. If Oz 
      understands her, he gives no indication - just starts pacing the cage, 
      restless.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW <br/>Maybe we should pick a less 
      - <br/>stimulating passage….</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She starts to leaf through he book when 
      XANDER enters, looking less than fully awake. He carries a thermos and 
      some magazines.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Private Harris reporting for 
      Oz watch.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Xander - oh 
      good….</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She moves to him - hands him the 
      book.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Call of the Wild. Aren't we 
      reading the <br/>Cliff Notes to this for English?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(gives him a look)<br/>Some of 
      us are. Anyway, it'll help you stay awake. <br/>It's good and very wolfy. 
      And it seems to sooth the<br/>savage beast. Except the stuff 
      about….<br/>(glances at Oz / low whisper)<br/>Rabbits.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander looks through the book - 
      confused.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Rabbits?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>He gets sort of…over 
      excited.<br/>(baby sitter talk)<br/>Now. He's already had his two o'clock 
      feeding. <br/>After sunrise, if he forgets where his clothes are - 
      <br/>They're on top of the file cabinet in his cage. And<br/>I put that 
      towel up for privacy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see that, indeed, there is a towel pinned 
      up in the cage.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>No worries. I can handle the 
      Oz full monty.<br/>(quickly)<br/>I mean - not handle, handle - <br/>like 
      "hands to flesh" handle.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It's not you I'm worried 
      about. It's me.<br/>I'm still getting used to half a monty.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Oh, 
      good-<br/>(alarmed)<br/>Half? You and Oz? Which half?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(enjoying his 
      wiggins)<br/>Wouldn't you like to know.<br/>(moving on)<br/>Okay - he's more 
      manageable tonight and on <br/>night three. Tomorrow - the total full moon? 
      <br/>That's the real howler. Still, if there's trouble <br/>- there won't be 
      - but, you know, if…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow hands Xander a BIG ASS TRANQUILIZER 
      GUN.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Sleepy time. 
      Gotchya.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now she grabs her stuff. Heads for the 
      door.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Thanks again for doing this. 
      <br/>I wouldn't ask, but I have this test-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>No big. You can count on me. 
      I got my coffee, <br/>magazines…Figured I'd read, run the stairs here…. I'm 
      good.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow waves and is off. Xander moves to the 
      cage - checks the door. It's secure. Then he sits at the table, 
      contemplates reading to Oz - but instead tosses the book aside and lays 
      his head down….</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Faith patrol together. The park is 
      quiet, and they enjoy a rare moment of girl bonding.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>You ever catch kids doing the 
      <br/>horizontal two-step out here?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Naw. There's a smooch spot 
      near the<br/>woods. That's where folks go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Yeah? Bet you and Scott been 
      out there<br/>Kicking the old gearshift.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hardly. We've only been out a 
      few times.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>But you like him, right? When 
      you think about<br/>Him you get that good, down low tickle?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well, yeah. I 
      -<br/>(then)<br/>How low?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH (grins)<br/>You tell 
      me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>How 'bout - 
      not?<br/>(then)<br/>But he is funny and nice and -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>-quite a 
      muffin.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Blueberry. With that 
      munchable, crumbly top.<br/>But my most favorite thing? So far, he 
      doesn't<br/>seem to be some sort of hell beast.</font></center>

      Buffy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Geez. I was sort of hoping not 
      to sound that<br/>cynical until at least forty.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Not cynical. Realistic. Every 
      guy - from <br/>"Manimal" right on down to "Mr. I Loved the <br/>English 
      Patient" - has beast in him. And I don't <br/>care how sensitive they act - 
      they're still just in<br/>it for the chase…..</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT WOODS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Speaking of… We hear the RASPY, GUTTURAL 
      BREATHING of something INHUMAN as it pursues a TERRIFIED YOUNG MAN through 
      the woods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The kid's clothes are torn and bloodied, his 
      face and body horribly scratched. He stumbles, hits the ground hard and 
      scrambles to regain his footing. But the creature pursuing him, still 
      UNSEEN, (except, perhaps, in quick flashes of and UNCLEAR BEAST/MAN 
      SILHOUETTE) GRABS HIM BY HIS LEGS - yanking him out of frame and to a 
      hideous (off camera) bone-crushing, flesh-tearing fate.</font></p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW (worried)<br/>I don't think

      </font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Pete and Debbie also come over - but at a 
      less infatuated pace. Pete's an attractive, friendly guy. Debbie is cute

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>Hi, Oz. Hey, you're not doing 
      Jazz band this year?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Can't take the pressure. It's not

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Yeah. But - you know - good jazz 
      is <br/>improvisational. So we'd be marching<br/>off in all directions. 
      Running into floats <br/>and stuff. Scary. </font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SCOTT<br/>Oh. We're not up to flowers.

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(sincerely)<br/>But if God

      great.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>Platt creeps me out. I would 
      totally quit<br/>going, but I'm flunking senior bio and my<br/>teacher says 
      I have "success issues."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Senior bio? I sort of aced that

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>See you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They start to go off in separate directions. 
      Buffy gives Scott a quick kiss on the lips before parting.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SCOTT<br/>Yeah. Good.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy talks to Oz and Willow as they move 
      down the hall.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay. You. Scott. School 
      kiss.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Not a deal. We've kissed 
      before.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But in the dark. Alone. A 
      school <br/>kiss is a whole 'nother deal. It's <br/>statement-y. it says - 
      hey, peers - <br/>we're smooching!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (anxious now)<br/>Do you think it 
      was too much?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I thought it was right. It said 
      "nice <br/>seeing you" - not - "take me now."<br/>Not that I have anything 
      against a <br/>"take me now" kiss, mind you.<br/>But it's not very 
      school.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Totally. That kind of kiss in 
      school is all<br/>about showing off. The "haves" rubbing<br/>it in the faces 
      of the "have-nots."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Willow stops at her locker. Oz lingers 
      with her as Buffy, preoccupied, moves on down the hall.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>So I'm good. Yeah. I 
      think…..</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And she's gone. Willow turns to 
      Oz.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'm not sure I completely 
      understand.<br/>What was the first kind of kiss?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Oh. That would be the "nice 
      seeing you kiss."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>And - how does that 
      go?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz smiles - getting it. He leans in, kisses 
      her sweetly but quickly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Nice seeing you.<br/>(then)<br/>Of 
      course - it can be a fine line.<br/>The "nice to see you" kiss can 
      easily<br/>morph into….</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now he gives her a slightly longer, more 
      intense kiss.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Really nice seeing you. And if 
      you aren't<br/>careful, that becomes….</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A pretty intense smooch which shows no signs 
      of stopping. So intense, in fact, that they don't notice TWO FRESHMAN BOYS 
      who pass them and roll their eyes. Show offs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">An agitated Giles stands with Xander, both 
      examining the BOOK CAGE.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Xander, examining the cage, puts in his 
      two cents.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>But it's not. Not wolf you - 
      or you you.<br/>Okay? The room was secure. The cage<br/>was locked. The 
      window's unbreakable and-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As he speaks he taps a HIGH WINDOW which is 
      laced with security wire. It SWINGS OPEN.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>-open.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh, God.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Hey. Not to freak. I rested 
      my eyes now<br/>and then. That's all.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles speaks carefully - trying to contain 
      his rising anger.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>And how long - exactly - did 
      you<br/>"rest your eyes" for?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>A little now. A little then. 
      But I never heard<br/>Oz leave and he was here in the morning when<br/>I… 
      when I - </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Woke up?</font></center>
<p></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>If you want to put it that

harder.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh, God.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OFF OZ AND WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Their faces etched with 
worry.<br/></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy arrives for her counseling session. 
      The office sports standard school shrink décor - "Your Brain on Drugs" 
      posters, etc. But there are also a few surprising touches of 
      whimsy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The shrink, MR. PLATT, faces away from Buffy 
      in a high back chair. All we see of him is one hand, which holds a smoking 
      cigarette.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>The two o'clock. Buffy 
      Summers.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Buffy Summers, reporting for 
      sanity…look, <br/>I know I have to do this and I'll cooperate, <br/>look at 
      ink blots, but I don't want to talk about<br/>my childhood or my life 
      or…anything, actually,<br/>and I don't want to be friends -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>We're not going to be 
      friends.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">This stops her. The chair turns slowly 
      around to reveal a surprisingly warm and okay guy. As he talks, he takes a 
      last drag, stubs out the cig, hides the ashtray in a drawer from which he 
      pulls a can of air freshener and sprays, puts it back and shuts the 
      drawer.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>You already have friends - 
      I hope.<br/>A friend is a good thing. Likes you, agrees<br/>with you, tells 
      you what you want to hear.<br/>What you do need is a trained, 
      not-too-crazy<br/>professional who will always give you his <br/>honest 
      opinion. Which I offer you.<br/>(then)<br/>Have a seat.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy does.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Not too crazy. Those are your 
      credentials?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>(points to certificates on 
      the wall)<br/>Those are my credentials. Look, Buffy.<br/>Any person - grown 
      up, shrink, pope, any <br/>person who claims to be totally sane is either 
      <br/>lying or not very bright. Everybody has problems.<br/>Everyone has 
      demons. Right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy can't help herself. She's starting to 
      like this guy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Gotta say I'm with you on that 
      one.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>Excellent. So, the hope I 
      bring you is that<br/>demons can be fought. People can change.<br/>You can 
      change. It's all about finding your<br/>strength. Believing in 
      yourself<br/>(then)<br/>Now. Your turn. Let's start with why you ran 
      away.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's a long 
      story.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>Bore me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm telling you - I'm so over 
      it. I feel good.<br/>I'm moving on. I'm even dating someone 
      new.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>All nice things. But still 
      - you're bringing me<br/>in at the end of the movie.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy sighs. She's not getting out of 
      this.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I was seeing this guy. It 
      ended badly. <br/>And my mom and I were fighting….<br/>I kind of 
      flipped.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>Tell me more about this 
      guy. The bad-ending guy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>He was the first person- I 
      loved him. But then…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>He 
changed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>He got 
      mean.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>But you didn't stop loving 
      him.<br/>(off her silence)<br/>You know - lots of people lose 
      themselves<br/>in love. It's no shame. They write songs about 
      it.<br/>(then)<br/>The hitch is - you can't stay lost. Sooner or<br/>later, 
      you have to get back to yourself.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And if you 
      can't?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MR. PLATT<br/>If you can't - love 
      becomes your master.<br/>And you're just it's dog.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy enters - thoughtful after seeing Plat. 
      She stops when she sees the grave expressions of Giles, Xander, Cordy, 
      Willow and Oz.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm afraid to 
      ask.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Oz ate someone last 
      night.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>He did not!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(to Cordy/stern)<br/>Oz does 
      not eat people. It's more, werewolf <br/>play. You know - I bat you around 
      a little bit. <br/>Like a cat toy. I have harmless wolf fun. Is it <br/>Oz' 
      fault that, you know, side effect, people get <br/>cut to ribbons and maybe 
      then he takes a little <br/>nibble and I'm not helping am 
I?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Oz may have 
      gotten out of his cage last night -<br/>Oz cuts him off - his tone 
      grim.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Or there just happened to be 
      another werewolf <br/>roaming the woods.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Perhaps. Or perhaps it was 
      something else <br/>entirely. Let's not overreact -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>(frustrated)<br/>Good in theory. 
      Not very helpful for the<br/>potential nibbler.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>That's why we all have to work 
      to find out <br/>what happened.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'll patrol the woods.<br/>(to 
      Willow and the others)<br/>You guys try to get into the 
      morgue.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Right, we can see if it's a 
      werewolf kill or <br/>not. But what about Oz?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Why don't we have Faith come 
      watch over him?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>You're having a slayer watch 
      me?<br/>Good thing we're not over-reacting</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Freaking - Oz heads for the library doors. 
      But he stops. A beat. He turns back.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Okay. You know that thing where 
      you bail <br/>in the middle of an upsetting conversation? <br/>I need to do 
      that. Kind of dramatic. But <br/>sometimes it's a necessary guy 
      thing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He starts out again - but Willow moves to 
      stop him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>And I want you to. Do the guy 
      thing - but…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks at the clock. It's half past five. 
      Oz follows her gaze - gets it. Has to fight all his instincts to bolt. 
      Supremely frustrated - he walks to the cage, closes the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON WILLOW, OZ AND THE CAGE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow moves to him - feeling for 
      him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oz….</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He can't even look at her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Get away from the 
      cage.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>It's going to happen soon. Get 
      away from me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow, devastated, backs off.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FADE TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. WOODS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The night time woods are extra spooky. Buffy 
      walks alone, a little wigged.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CRACK!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy jumps at the sound of a twig breaking. 
      She peers into the tangled vines and tree branches surrounding her. 
      Nothing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She takes a deep breath - pushes 
      on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SOMETHING CRASHES THROUGH THE BUSHES NEAR 
      HER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">This time it's not a question - Buffy 
      SPRINTS in the direction of the noise. Stops, trying to get her 
      bearings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Again, she's greeted by silence. The 
      creature is lying low.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WHOOSH! Silhouetted against the FULL MOON, 
      the MAN/BEAST CREATURE races by Buffy and KNOCKS her to the ground. She 
      leaps back up - stake raised - ready for battle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And she stops - frozen - at what she 
      sees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Feral. Mouth stained with dried blood. Eyes

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Back to Angel and Buffy. She's so taken 
      aback at seeing him - so completely stunned - that she barely reacts as HE 
      BARRELS INTO HER AGAIN, knocking her down. Hard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Fighting to get back on her feet. The sound 
      of ANGEL'S SNARLING APPROACH through the bushes seems to surround her. He 
      comes at her again. But this time she's ready - meets his oncoming 
      velocity with a HEAD BUTT.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now they TANGLE on the ground. Buffy gets in 
      a few good licks but ANGEL is still BRUTALLY strong - she's having trouble 
      making any real gains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Finally, Buffy manages to get to her feet. 
      She races ahead - disappearing into the dark shadows of the 
      forest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON ANGEL</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who stops dead. His instincts working 
      overtime. It's clear to us that this is not the Angel we knew. He's more 
      beast than man.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WHOOSH!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy SWINGS FROM A TREE BRANCH AND DRIVES 
      RIGHT INTO HIM - knocking the WIND OUT OF HIM as he SLAMS TO THE GROUND. 
      Now she straddles him and CLOCKS him with a BRUTAL UPPERCUT. He's 
      out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks around. Sees a number of small 
      eviscerated ANIMAL CARCASSES littering the ground near by.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Breathing hard. On total 
overload.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. MORGUE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow makes her way with a flashlight 
      through the dark morgue. Checks the names on a few body drawers until she 
      finds what she was looking for.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She open the drawer - silently reacts to the 
      horribly thrashed body we can (thankfully) barely see. Swallows hard. Then 
      she opens a plastic LUNCH BOX (Scooby Doo?) which contains her "autopsy" 
      tools; a scalpel, a pair of tweezers, some cotton swabs, a couple of 
      plastic baggies, etc… She's so preoccupied that she doesn't notice the 
      SHADOWY FIGURE MOVE behind her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER 
      (O.C.)<br/>(aghast)<br/>God……</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">IT'S JUST XANDER - who looks quickly away 
      from the body. To gaze on this dude is clearly more than a mere mortal can 
      handle. But Willow keeps her cool.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(hands him a baggie)<br/>Here. 
      Hold this open.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He takes it - still looking away. Willow 
      scrapes some stuff from under the corpse's fingernails with a swab and 
      deposits the swab into the bag.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now, unnoticed, CORDELIA steps from the 
      darkness. Touches Xander's arm. Xander startled, freaks.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>We're doing crime, 
      Cordy.<br/>You don't sneak up during crime!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>God. Have a - 
      </font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But she stops when she sees the body - she 
      TRIPS. Covers her eyes.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA <br/>Okay. Scarred for 
      life.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I think both "scarred" and 
      "life" <br/>are moot for this fella, Cordy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Not him - me. Willow, how 
      can you stand it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Yeah, Will. This guy is 
      barf-worthy.<br/>Can't we be elsewhere? Is Oz cleared or 
      what?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'm not sure. I mean, there 
      are a lot of <br/>incised wounds - but they could be from anything. 
      </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Anything with really big, 
      sharp teeth and - </font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander turns his flashlight on her, cutting 
      her off.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Do you want to go back to the 
      car and wait?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>What? I'm just 
      saying-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Almost done. Let me just get 
      a few stray <br/>hairs off the body. They may be from the 
      attacker….</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow uses her tweezers and carefully 
      removes some hairs.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Great. So we got everything 
      we need?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(to Xander)<br/>Yeah. That's 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And WILLOW FAINTS, falling right out of 
      frame. Xander and Cordelia react, moving to help her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(worried)<br/>Okay - little 
      too much excitement for the Willster…<br/>(to Cordy)<br/>It doesn't look 
      good for Oz, does it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>(no duh)<br/>It really 
      doesn't. This guy was ripped apart <br/>by a wild animal.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. MANSION - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">AN OLD TRUNK</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Which BUFFY, working in a panicked rush, 
      dumps over. We see a bunch of DRUSILLA'S DOLLS and other personal items 
      spill onto the floor. At the bottom of the trunk are some long lengths of 
      CHAIN and some WRIST SHACKLES.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANOTHER ANGLE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Breathing hard - both from effort and fear - 
      BUFFY threads a length of CHAIN through one of the ORNAMENTAL WALL MOUNTS 
      bolted to the wall in the main room of the mansion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANOTHER ANGLE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy SLAPS a SHACKLE closed around a 
      wrist….</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">AND NOW WE SEE ANGEL</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who struggles against Buffy as she binds his 
      other wrist. We see now that the chains are long enough that Angel can sit 
      and move - a little.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Finished, Buffy sits back heavily - 
      exhausted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She stares at Angel - in a state of shock. 
      Angel, tugging at his restraints, gives no sign that he's still aware of 
      her in the room. Much less aware of who she is to him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy starts to get up - notices the BLACK 
      SCORCH MARKS on the floor where Angel returned. She moves to them - runs a 
      finger through the dark soot, puzzled….</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT</font></p>

      DANCES in front of Oz' cage. She's really jamming and doesn't see BUFFY 
      ENTER.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy glances at OZ, who is locked up - in 
      wolf mode. Post Angel, Buffy finds the sight of him heavily 
      unsettling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Buffy moves to Faith - who is bopping 
      away from her. Buffy gently taps her shoulder. Faith spins and SMASHES 
      BUFFY in the face. Hard. Buffy stumbles back.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oww - !</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith sees what she's done. Rips the 
      headphones off. We can HEAR strains of SCREAMING HEAVY METAL through 
      them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Buffy! Are you okay!?<br/>What 
      are you doing here?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Bleeding internally. But I'll 
      live.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>God, I'm sorry… I didn't hear 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I figured. Ow - 
      again.<br/>(then)<br/>I came to give you the rest of the night 
      off.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Get out of jail free, huh? How 
      come?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Can't sleep. Figured I'd cram 
      for my French test.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith grabs her stuff. Tosses Buffy the key 
      to Oz' cage.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Cool. I was going nuts in 
      here. I bet I <br/>can still get in a few good stakings before 
      sunrise.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Knock yourself out. But not 
      literally.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Later.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And she's gone. Buffy watches after her for 
      a beat - then turns and goes to the library card file. She pulls a file 
      drawer out and carries it back to the table….</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FADE TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Early the next morning. Giles enters the 
      library and moves to the cage - sees Oz, back to his human self, safe and 
      sound and curled in a little nekkid ball. Giles unlocks the 
      cage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now he turns and is surprised to find BUFFY 
      asleep at the table. She's surrounded by books on stuff like REINCARNATION 
      and ALTERNATE DIMENSIONS. Giles picks up one of the books - examines it 
      more closely. Sensing him, Buffy wakes.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hey….</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now she realizes that it's GILES. She stands 
      abruptly - starts to close the books.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hey! Can you believe Faith and 
      <br/>these nutty books?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's not buying it. Reads a few book titles 
      aloud.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>"Exploring Demon Dimensions." 
      <br/>"The Mystery of Acathala…"</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know! And she still listens 
      to <br/>heavy metal. Freaky deaky.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Buffy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy drops the act. Sits. She knows she's 
      busted.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What if I told you…. I had a 
      dream <br/>about Angel. And it brought up some questions.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I'd say it was to be 
      expected.<br/>(re: card file)<br/>But it must have been quite a dream. <br/>I 
      didn't think you knew what these cards were for.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah. I dreamt that he came 
      back.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Giles sits.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Of course. After Jenny was 
      killed - <br/>I had dreams that she was still alive. <br/>That I saved 
      her.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But this dream was vivid. 
      Really vivid. <br/>I mean, three-dimensional, sensurround, <br/>the hills 
      are alive-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles' face registers concern.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You get my 
      point.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Do you believe it was a 
      prophecy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(carefully)<br/>No. I don't 
      know. It just made me wonder. <br/>I mean - is there a chance, even? Could 
      it happen?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles considers. Just the prospect makes him 
      uncomfortable.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>There's no record of someone 
      returning <br/>from a demon dimension once the "gate" <br/>has closed. I 
      can't imagine how it would <br/>happen or why.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay. But let's pretend - 
      wacky world - <br/>he somehow ended up here in Sunnydale <br/>again. I mean, 
      what would he be like?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I can't really say. What 
      little is known <br/>about the dimension accessed via Acathala <br/>suggest 
      a world of brutal torment. And <br/>time in demon worlds moves quite 
      different that here - </font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah. I remember… So, - Angel 
      would have <br/>been there for, like, close to a hundred 
      years?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Yes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Of torture.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(nods)<br/>Only a person with 
      tremendous will and character <br/>could survive that and retain any 
      semblance of self.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy reels from this news.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>He'd be a monster. A lost 
      cause.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Maybe… Maybe not. In my 
      experience, <br/>there are two kinds of monsters. The first <br/>type can be 
      redeemed. And, more importantly, <br/>they want to be 
      redeemed…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And the second 
      type?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>The second - is void of 
      humanity. <br/>It can not respond to reason. Or love.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy takes this in, freaked, 
      when-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Enters with a bakery bag in hand. Sees 
      Buffy, who is still tripping from the conversation with Giles.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I thought Faith was on 
      duty.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Change of 
      plans.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow opens the bag - holds it out. It's 
      full of donuts.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Glazed or cake? It's fun to 
      watch them <br/>make them, you know. They have this <br/>spritzy thing that 
      plops the batter right-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(interrupting)<br/>You couldn't 
      sleep either?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I've been sitting in Mr. 
      Donut since the <br/>TV did that snowy thing.<br/>(then)<br/>But, how come 
      you're wakey-girl? I mean, <br/>this time it's not your boyfriend who may 
      <br/>be a cold-blooded-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow's startled by OZ, WHO STEPS FROM THE 
      CAGE, buttoning his shirt.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>-jelly donut.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She holds the bag out to Oz. Smiles too 
      big.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Everything okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah - what happened with the 
      inspection <br/>of the body?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(re: donuts)<br/>Anybody? 
      They're yummy delicious.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(anxious)<br/>Come on, Will. 
      Was it a werewolf…..<br/>(quietly)<br/>Was it a vampire?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They just look at her. She bites the 
      bullet.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It wasn't conclusive. 
      I-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy interrupts, intense.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>How could you not conclude? I 
      mean, <br/>what did it look like? Was he bit?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(cutting her off)<br/>Let her 
      finish, Buffy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's just…. 
      Sorry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow glances at Oz - worried.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I should know more after 
      tonight. <br/>I'm doing hair and fiber tests.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>You know how to do 
      those?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(caught)<br/>Not - I…like to 
      sound technical when I'm scared. <br/>But I figure - wolf hair, hair found 
      on the body. <br/>See if they match. It's a test.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>So we're scared now. It's 
      official.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What? Oh - no - I didn't mean 
      it that way-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>No. I'd say scared is pretty much 
      called for. It's cool.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Thinking about Angel. Knowing as well as the 
      others that it's not cool. Not at all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CAFETERIA - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy moves through the crowded room with 
      her lunch tray, trying to find a table. Sees SCOTT sitting with Debbie and 
      Pete. He waves her over. A beat - then Buffy pastes on a smile and joins 
      them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SCOTT<br/>Can't back you on this lunch. 
      <br/>Nutritional demerits.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy glances at her tray. She has three 
      different kinds of Jello - and nothing else.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>My stomach doesn't want hard 
      food. <br/>There's fruit stuff in there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SCOTT<br/>Those are 
      marshmallows.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh…..<br/>(then)<br/>I'm kinda 
      out of it today. Didn't sleep well.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>Just don't tell Mr. Platt 
      you've got insomnia. <br/>He'll make you start a "dream 
      journal."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>What's that - like a Barbie 
      thing? "Dear <br/>Dream Journal, why hasn't Ken come around <br/>since he 
      got that earring…?"</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>I never did it. He's a 
      quack.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I sort of thought he was 
      cool.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>Really?<br/>(trying)<br/>I 
      guess he can be funny and stuff. <br/>It's just - I don't like the things 
      he <br/>says sometimes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah. He definitely marches to 
      the beat <br/>of his own drummer. In fact - I think <br/>he makes his own 
      drums.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SCOTT<br/>My mom say therapy can be 
      completely helpful-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>Your Mom has the wattage of a 
      Zippo lighter, Scott.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Debbie tries to stifle a laugh. Scott takes 
      Pete's barbs in stride. He puts a protective hand on Buffy's 
      leg.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SCOTT<br/>I hope you realize I don't 
      actually know these <br/>people. I just thought you'd like me better if 
      <br/>I had friends - so I hired them.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now he moves closer - shutting out Pete and 
      Debbie and getting kind of boyfriend-y. Buffy smiles - but it's clear 
      she's uncomfortable.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SCOTT<br/>(then/quietly)<br/>So - I 
      wanted to tell you that you look great <br/>today. But now I want to raise 
      that to amazing <br/>because you didn't sleep well.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's making smitten eyes at her. Buffy knows 
      she should be making them back - but she's too spun.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>God. That's incredibly 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She pulls away from him. Starts to get up 
      from the table.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>-sweet…. And I wish I didn't 
      have to… <br/>But I just remembered… that I do… <br/>I'll see 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She smiles sort of wanly at the table and 
      takes off - leaving them all at a loss.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>Check out Scott. Liking the 
      manic-depressive chick.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Scott shoots Pete a seriously warning look. 
      Pete backs off.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>Kidding, my friend. She's 
      special. <br/>Like two very hot girlfriends in one.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Rushing out of the cafeteria. Losing 
      it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. MANSION - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy enters. Finds Angel shaking as if he 
      is freezing and huddled in a corner - his restraints still firmly in 
      place. He turns his gaze on her, watches her intently, silently… She moves 
      a little closer - instinctively, he moves back.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Angel? Can you - 
      ?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He just looks at her. She tries again - 
      reaches tentatively out and TOUCHES HIM.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And Angel SNARLS like a wounded dog - as if 
      he's been touched by acid. Shackled hands fly out to defend himself. And 
      his eyes burn into Buffy. Angry - unrecognizing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Falls away from him. Startled, mortified, 
      she takes off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON ORNAMENTAL WALL MOUNT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As it LOOSENS a bit from the pressure on 
      Angel's restraints.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The fall light melts into late afternoon 
      amber as we see PETE, coaxing a nervous, giggling Debbie toward the GARDEN 
      SHED that sits back on the school property.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>Come on - just for a 
      minute…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>I can't. I have to meet a 
      friend-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL - GARDEN SHED - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Pete pulls her inside the shed. The 
      place is obviously frequented by lusty teenagers. The walls are COVERED 
      WITH HEARTS AND INITIALS. Pete pulls Debbie into his arms. She submits in 
      short order and they kiss hungrily. He tries to move her into a darker 
      part of the shed, but Debbie pulls away - nervous.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>No. Let - Let's stay 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>What's with you today? 
      Relax…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Pete grabs her. They start to go at it 
      again. Then Pete opens his eyes in the midst of a smooch - notices a 
      BOTTLE on one of the SHELVES BEHIND DEBBIE. It's EMPTY - but the remnants 
      of a GLOWING, EERIE GREEN liquid cling to the inside of the bottle. He 
      pulls back from her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>What is that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>Nothing. Kiss 
      me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Debbie tries to pull him back into an 
      embrace - clearly not wanting him to see the bottle. But it's too late. He 
      looks at Debbie, shocked.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>You didn't drink that, did 
      you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>Drink it? You - you know I 
      didn't.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Pete doesn't buy it. He's 
      freaking.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>Debbie… What's going 
      on?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy moves purposefully down the 
      hallway</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The door is open a crack. Buffy looks in. 
      Sees that Mr. Platt is there. He's smoking, turned away from her in his 
      chair - the way he was the first time she came to see him. Buffy starts to 
      pace - anxious.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Two o'clock, Buffy right. 
      Don't turn <br/>around and don't say anything. Just <br/>listen. That's your 
      thing, right?<br/>(with difficulty)<br/>Something's going on… I mean, the 
      <br/>whole entire story will probably convince <br/>you I'm like, loony bin 
      material. But I <br/>can't tell anybody - not Willow, not Giles, 
      <br/>nobody… They'd just freak out on me or <br/>maybe do something… And 
      I'm… I need help.<br/>(near tears)<br/>I need to talk to someone. I'm so 
      <br/>scared. I - this guy, he…</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL - GARDEN SHED - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Back to Debbie, Pete and that GLOWING BOTTLE 
      OF LIQUID. Debbie is clearly terrified as Pete, bottle in hand, continues 
      his interrogation of her. His tone is different now - both menacing and 
      condescending.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>So - the bottle jumped out of 
      the <br/>cabinet and spilled on its own?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>Of course not 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He advances on her. Debbie meekly 
      retreats.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>I - I was just trying to get 
      rid of it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Pete's anger shifts to icy rage at this 
      confession.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>You were trying to get rid of 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>To help you. You know how you 
      get-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Pete grabs Debbie - holds the bottle close 
      to her face. Debbie flinches, her terror growing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: PETE'S HAND</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Clenched into a fist - the veins in the back 
      of it throbbing menacingly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>You think this has anything to 
      <br/>do with "how I get?"</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>Well, when you drink 
      it-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>When I drink it - nothing! I 
      don't <br/>need it anymore, Debbie. I'm past that now-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He yanks Debbie ROUGHLY over to a line of 
      shelves. Amid the PESTICIDES and GARDEN FERTILIZERS, we see more ODD 
      LIQUIDS AND CHEMISTRY SET TYPE STUFF.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He grabs the bottles and beakers and starts 
      to SMASH THEM on the ground - steadily losing control.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>See? No more! You can pour out 
      <br/>everything I made and it won't help - <br/>and you want to know 
      why?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Debbie just shakes her head. Pete grips her 
      harder-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>You know why?! Because all it 
      takes <br/>is you now, Debbie. You and your <br/>stupid, grating 
      voice-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Suddenly - Pete's HEAD STARTS TO THRASH 
      WILDLY and he SCREAMS WITH RAGE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Just as abruptly, his head STOPS - and we 
      see that a chilling transformation has taken place. Pete has turned into a 
      RAGE MONSTER. An ADRENALINE PUMPED, VEINY creature with razor sharp teeth 
      and claws.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Debbie watches - frozen, petrified. She 
      knows what's coming. Now Pete BELLOWS at her - his voice a garbled 
      bark.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>You're the reason I started 
      with the <br/>formulas in the first place - to be the <br/>man you wanted. 
      And you pay me <br/>back, how? You whore around with <br/>other guys and 
      taunt-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>No! I don't! I don't even 
      look-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WHAM! Pete brutally SMACKS Debbie - sending 
      her reeling.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>I was talking! Is that 
      something your <br/>shrink taught you, Debbie - to "share?" <br/>To 
      "communicate?" To piss me off!?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He advances on her again. Picks her up from 
      the floor. She's crying now.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>Well, guess what? Even he's not 
      going <br/>to listen to your pathetic ramblings anymore-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BAM! Another hit and Debbie collapses. Pete 
      stands over her - shaking with rage.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>I'm all you've got, Debbie. 
      <br/>You hear me!? I'm all you've got!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Debbie nods through her tears, wipes a 
      trickle of blood from her mouth. It seems her sobs have an effect on him. 
      As it dawns on him what he's done - his expression softens. The adrenaline 
      seems to DRAIN from his body.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>Ah, hell. God…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And just as suddenly as he changed - PETE 
      DEFLATES, changing back to his normal self. Non-monster Pete is instantly 
      repentant. He moves to Debbie, gathers her in his arms.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>Baby, you okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Debbie, in shock, nods "yes". He kisses her 
      forehead.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>You know you shouldn't make 
      <br/>me mad. You know what happens. <br/>(off her silence)<br/>Please, 
      Debbie. You alright?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat. Finally, Debbie wraps her arms 
      around him and they rock together. When she speaks - her tone is 
      soothing.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>It's okay… It's 
      okay…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow and Faith sit with a shaken Buffy. 
      Giles paces.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>This creature is especially 
      brutal. I <br/>think the charming phrase the coroner <br/>used when 
      describing Mr. Platt was <br/>"pureed." But he did confirm that Platt 
      <br/>had been dead just a few hours when <br/>Buffy found 
      him.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Which means the guy was killed 
      during the day.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's reaction to this is tempered. She's 
      seen Platt. But Willow can't hide her joy. She punches a fist in the 
      air.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yes!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Everybody looks at her. She slowly lowers 
      her hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Sorry. I got a little… I 
      mean, <br/>it's horrible. Horrible.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's okay, Will. We're all 
      glad <br/>Oz is off the hook.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(concerned)<br/>Indeed. But 
      shouldn't he be here <br/>by now? The sun sets at half past 
      five.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. FOUNTAIN COURT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Speaking of… OZ waits by the fountain, 
      checks his watch. He starts to bail - when he's stopped by a breathless 
      DEBBIE.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>Sorry I'm late. Did you bring 
      the notes?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She's all smiles - trying to finish their 
      business and move on before he picks up on her black eye and streaked 
      make-up. But Oz, handing her the notes, catches on to the 
      weirdness.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>You okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>What? Oh, yeah. I'm such a 
      klutz. I, uh…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz nods knowingly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Fell down and hit your… 
      eye.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>Door knob. <br/>(re: 
      notes)<br/>Thanks.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She starts to take off - Oz puts a hand on 
      her arm.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Hey. If you want to 
      talk-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Debbie sighs. She's heard this 
      before.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OTHER END OF FOUNTAIN COURT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As PETE arrives, unnoticed by them. He sees 
      Oz and Debbie talking closely. It doesn't sit well with him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON DEBBIE AND OZ</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Still unaware that Pete is watching. Debbie 
      is momentarily swayed Oz' concern - puts her own hand on his for a 
      moment.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>I -<br/>(thinks better of 
      it)<br/>Thanks again for the notes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She pulls away - takes off. Oz debates going 
      after her. But it's too close to sunset. He moves toward the 
      school.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, Giles, Faith and Willow continue the 
      discussion of Mr. Platt's killer.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Our task now is to determine 
      what <br/>sort of killer we're dealing with-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Oz enters. Unnoticed by the others, he 
      overhears Giles next comment.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Clearly we're looking for a 
      depraved, <br/>sadistic animal.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz steps forward. Grim.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Present. <br/>(glances at 
      Willow)<br/>Hey. I may be a cold blooded jelly <br/>donut - but my timing's 
      impeccable.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow can't contain herself. Runs to him, 
      excited.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But you're not! It's a "kill 
      in the day" <br/>monster! One-hundred percent for sure.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat as Oz takes this in. 
      Nodding.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Filled with relief - they hug. Giles gives 
      them a moment before getting back on task.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I wish we had time to 
      celebrate properly. <br/>Unfortunately, it's imperative that we <br/>find 
      out who or what is doing this.<br/>(then)<br/>Now. We have two victims. Jeff 
      Walken, <br/>and now Platt. Perhaps they have <br/>something in 
      common-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>Missing internal 
      organs?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Besides that.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz' wheels are turning.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Debbie.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">All eyes turn to him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Victim #1. Jeff? He was in Jazz 
      <br/>band with us. They used to horse around.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>They were 
      screwing?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I don't think so. But he hid her 
      music <br/>comp book once.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Good enough. And we know 
      Debbie knew <br/>Mr. Platt. She was seeing him and way vocal <br/>about not 
      having the love for the guy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Add this and stir. I ran into her 
      just <br/>now - sporting a nasty black eye.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay. Pretend Debbie wanted 
      Platt <br/>dead. Maybe he fought back.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No, he was dead in an instant. 
      <br/>Didn't even lose his cigarette.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">That's it. Buffy stands.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Could be - boyfriend Pete's 
      the <br/>one doling out the punishment.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now everybody mobilizes.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>We have to find them both 
      immediately.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>Deb was in the hall a minute 
      ago.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>We should split up. Faith - 
      you and I <br/>will team. Willow - you stick with Buffy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Oz, stands - chimes in with the same urgency 
      as the others.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ<br/>I'll - lock myself in the 
      cage.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We find Debbie at the mirror with her 
      make-up bag. She's trying to mask the bright purple bruises around her 
      eye.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now we see Buffy and Willow, who have just 
      entered. They observe Debbie for a moment. Then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's tricky covering a fresh 
      shiner like <br/>that. You know what works?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Debbie, startled, looks up from the mirror. 
      Answers warily.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Don't get hit.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Debbie's heard enough. Starts to gather her 
      things. But Buffy moves closer - her tone kind but determined.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What's going on, 
      Debbie?<br/>I'd bet the farm you know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>You're wrong. I don't know 
      anything.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Now - normally? I'd say - you 
      want to <br/>play "I have a secret" - fine. But people are 
      dying.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A long beat. Debbie, trapped, stammers 
      -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>It's - it's not his fault. I 
      mean, he's not <br/>himself when he gets like this…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Willow exchange looks.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You mean Pete.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>(nods)<br/>It's me. I make him 
      crazy. He just <br/>does what he does because he loves <br/>me too much 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>So it is him? But weren't Mr. 
      Platt <br/>and Jeff murdered by an animal?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy gets it - fixes Debbie with a hard 
      look.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Pete's… not like other guys, 
      is he Debbie?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It dawns on Debbie what she just did - that 
      she gave Pete up. She panics, starts for the door.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>I - I've got to 
      go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy blocks her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You have to talk to us. We 
      can't <br/>help you until you do.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>I didn't ask for your 
      help.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well, when are you going to? 
      I <br/>mean - if Pete kills you - it'll be <br/>pretty much too 
      late.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Debbie. We're running out of 
      time.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OFF DEBBIE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Frightened despite herself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. MANSION - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We move across the cavernous room until we 
      find Angel - who pulls with all his might at his restraints. That wall 
      mount that was loosening? It finally gives and falls from the wall. 
      Although still in chains and shackles, he's not secured to anything. He's 
      free.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A moment, then he bolts out of 
      frame.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GIRLS LOCKER ROOM - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Back to Debbie, Buffy and Willow.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Where can we find him, 
      Debbie?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>(freaking)<br/>I - I don't 
      know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You're lying.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Debbie tries to mask her fear with 
      bravado.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>What if I am. What are you 
      going <br/>to do about it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(wincing)<br/>Wrong 
      question.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Frustrated now, Buffy takes Debbie and turns 
      her toward the mirror. Makes Debbie look at her bruised and swollen 
      face.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Look at yourself. Why are you 
      <br/>protecting him?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Debbie looks away. Doesn't 
answer.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Anybody who really loved you 
      <br/>couldn't do this to you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DEBBIE<br/>He's going to change. He 
      promised -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Maybe. At best 50/50. Lame

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's back in the hall where she lost

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith is gaining on Oz when he suddenly 
      turns tail and RACES TOWARD HER. Before she has time to react - HE PLOWS 
      into her and they both go tumbling to the ground. Faith drops the 
      tranquilizer gun and it goes skittering across the floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow, observing this form a distance, 
      SCREAMS.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy jumps out of the window Pete escaped 
      through. Sees that she's standing right in front of the garden shed. And, 
      behind a grimy window, something seems to be moving inside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL - GARDEN SHED - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy enters cautiously. DEBBIE'S body lies

      Nothing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Distracted by Debbie, Buffy doesn't see PETE 
      move behind her. He grabs her with vicious force - HURLS her into a

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where Faith and Oz battle on the floor. 
      Faith, pinned beneath him, manages to hold him off - but she won't be able

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FAITH<br/>The gun! Where's the 
      gun!?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow searches the floor. Sees it under Oz' 
      hind leg. There's no way Faith can get to it. Willow makes a snap 
      decision. RUNS UP and PULLS OZ' TAIL. HARD.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Get off her!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">OZ SNARLS in protest - turns his steely EYES

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Get the gun, get the gun, 
      <br/>get the gun!!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat - then a properly distracted OZ goes 
      after Willow, gaining on her easily. Faith scrambles for the 
      gun.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>HURRY!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BOOM! Faith shoots OZ dead on. Willow hits 
      the ground as Oz TUMBLES PAST HER. Lands in a panting heap.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL - GARDEN SHED - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">This time Buffy's the victim of surprise. 
      She falls HARD on the ground. Doesn't have time to recover before Pete is 
      on her again, SLAMMING HER WITH BRUTAL PUNCH AFTER BRUTAL PUNCH. She tries 
      to fight, but Pete seems to GROW STRONGER AND STRONGER WITH his growing 
      FURY.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PETE<br/>All the same! You're all the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Faith and Willow cautiously approach Oz - 
      who is unable to fend off the powerful drugs in his system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He lifts his head - looks at Willow - and 
      with a grunt, passes out. Willow reaches down and strokes his fur 
      tenderly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>We have to get you a better

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, reeling from another hit, tries to 
      get to her feet - sees a shadow rise against the wall of the shed. She 
      turns - fists up, ready again to fight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But IT'S ANGEL in the doorway - in VAMPFACE. 
      He still has the LONG LENGTH OF CHAIN strung from one shackled wrist to 
      the other. He powers toward her, yielding the chain like a weapon. Buffy 
      flinches - confused - is he coming for her? But he flashes PAST HER AND 
      LASHES PETE WITH THE CHAIN, sending him reeling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Recovering from the beating she took, Buffy 
      watches, stunned, as Pete slashes viciously at Angel with his claws. In 
      response, Angel wails on Pete with the chain - one mighty blow after 
      another - trying to knock the fight out of him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Finally - Pete manages to get a hand on 
      Angel's face - cutting him and jabbing for his EYES. Angel falls 
      back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Pete LUNGES, razor claws bared, for an 
      unprepared Buffy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angel sees this. With no time to think, he 
      THROWS THE CHAIN AROUND PETE'S NECK and YANKS IT TIGHT - snapping Pete's 
      neck.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angel extracts the chains and retreats. Pete 
      falls, limp, to the ground. A beat and his labored breathing stops. Then 
      we make along his lifeless body, revealing that he has CHANGED INTO HIS 
      NON-MONSTER SELF. Angel returns to Buffy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON BUFFY AND ANGEL</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Angel approaches her. Buffy isn't sure 
      what to do - whether she should be on the defensive or not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But before she can make up her mind, he 
      MORPHS back to human face and speaks his first human word - desperate and 
      hopeful…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>Buffy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They lock eyes. It's him. She sees the 
      kindness returned there. The familiarity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She nods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And with her affirmation - Angel falls to 
      his knees at her feet. Despite the chains and shackles, he wraps his arms 
      around her waist. Begins to cry as he feels the first comfort he's know in 
      a hundred years.</font></p>

      <br/>And that's why I adore you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>So what's the true 
      story?<br/>What happened?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well, we found Pete's lab 
      diaries and <br/>stuff. Mr. Science was pulling a <br/>Jeckel/Hyde deal. He 
      was afraid Debbie <br/>would leave him - so he mixed this <br/>potion to get 
      super mas macho.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Thing was, after a while, he 
      didn't need <br/>a potion to turn into the bad guy. He <br/>got there on the 
      natch.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>So it was like a real 
      killing? He wasn't <br/>under the influence of anything?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Just himself.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Everyone takes this in. Then Buffy spies 
      Scott across the way.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'd better…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She moves off toward him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CORDELIA<br/>Great. Now I'm going to be 
      stuck <br/>with serious thoughts all day.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Exasperated, she moves off. Xander gives 
      Willow and Oz a look - then follows her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY AND SCOTT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Sitting by the fountain together. Scott's in 
      a shocky place.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't even know what to say 
      <br/>that won't sound stupid or obvious.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SCOTT<br/>I've been friends with both of 
      them <br/>since before we started school…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>If there's anything I can do 
      -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SCOTT<br/>Thanks. I'll be fine - 
      or…<br/>(then)<br/>It's just… You never really know what's <br/>going on 
      inside somebody - do you? You <br/>think if you care about them - you know. 
      <br/>But you never really do.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Off Buffy - his words hitting 
      home.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FADE TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. MANSION - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON ANGEL</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Sleeping fitfully on the ground. Haunted by 
      animal dreams. A century of suffering.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WIDEN TO INCLUDE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Huddled in the opposite corner, just 
      watching him…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY (V.O.)<br/>"Night came on, and a 
      full moon rose <br/>high over the trees, lighting the land <br/>till it lay 
      bathed in ghostly day… and <br/>the strain of the primitive remained alive 
      <br/>and active. Faithfulness and devotion, <br/>things born of fire and 
      roof, were his; <br/>yet he retained his wildness and wiliness. <br/>And 
      from the depths of the forest - the <br/>call still 
      sounded."</font></center>
