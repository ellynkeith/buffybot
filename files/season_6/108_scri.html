<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
      <p>A misty night. BUFFY walks alone, patrolling. But her mind is far away; 
      her eyes unfocused. She does her job by rote. 
      <p>Several yards back, a SHADOWY FIGURE trails her, obscured by the mist. 
      <p>SHADOWY FIGURE'S POV: Fixated on Buffy. Drawing closer. The SOUND of 
      HEAVY BREATH and QUICKENING FOOTSTEPS. 
      <p>ON BUFFY: As she stops walking. Her eyes suddenly snap to focus. Spider 
      senses at the tingle. 
      <p>She whirls around, body tense, stake poised, only to find herself face 
      to face with... 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Can we talk?</center>
<p>Buffy gives Spike an irritated look. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Vocal cord wise, yes. With each<vr> other, no.</vr></center>
<p>She turns and starts to walk. Spike holds his ground, calls after her: 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>We have to talk.</center>
<p>She turns. Maybe ten feet separate them. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>About what?</center>
<p>A beat. Confronted like this, Spike's a bit shy. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Um, whatever. Just conversation.<br/>For instance, the 
      weather, <br/>the... graves.. the --<br/>(suddenly; strong)<br/>We kissed, 
      Buffy.</center>
<p>Buffy stares him down, seemingly unaffected. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>So? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>We kissed, you and me, all 'Gone with<br/>the Wind' with the 
      rising music and<br/>the rising ... music, and what was<br/>that Buffy? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>A spell.</p></p></center>
<p>She turns again and walks away. 
      <p>EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT - SOON AFTER 
      <p>Spike follows after Buffy, talking to her back. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Don't you get all prim and proper on<br/>me. I know what 
      kind of girl you<br/>really are.</center>
<p>She stops walking. He walks around her, facing her, close. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Don't I? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What we did, is done. But I will<br/>never kiss you Spike, 
      never touch<br/>you, ever, ever again.</p></center>
<p>Half a beat and... SHE THROWS HERSELF AT HIM. Knocking him to the 
      ground, just as a FLYING STAKE WHIZZES BY, missing Spike by inches and 
      IMPALING ITSELF IN A TREE just behind them. 
      <p>They look up, to face A SHARK-HEADED DEMON and his two VAMPIRE HEAVIES.

<p>EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT - CONTINUED 
      <p>Buffy rolls off Spike and faces the demon and vampires. She's more 
      irritated than frightened. Not in the mood to deal. 
      <p>The Demon has the head of a shark; smooth, pale flesh split by an 
      unctuous smile. Several rows of teeth glisten. He wears a tight sharkskin 
      suit and stacked heel boots which bring him up to about 5'2". He never 
      stops moving, ever; he's always pacing, always smiling. Smooth and 
      dangerous, somewhere between Christopher Walken, Truman Capote, and well, 
      a shark. He goes by TEETH. 
      <p>His vampire heavies are poised to fight, one of them holds a stake. 
      Teeth motions for them to relax. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH<br/>Easy, boys. There's no need to get<br/>physical-like. Is 
      there Mr. Spike?</center>
<p>Buffy looks at Spike. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You know this guy? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Yeah.<br/>(to Teeth)<br/>What do you 
want?</p></center>
<p>Teeth walks past Buffy and Spike, reaches up to wrench the stake loose 
      from the tree trunk. He paces, using the stake to clean under his 
      fingernails. Conversational but menacing. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH<br/>Me? There are a lot of things I<br/>would like. A house in 
      Bel Aire with<br/>a generously-sized swimming pool; a<br/>lady barracuda who 
      loves me for who<br/>I really am ...</center>
<p>Suddenly, he's in Spike's face, his voice sharp. The stake at Spike's 
      heart. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH (cont'd)<br/>And the forty Siamese that you owe<br/>me. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Take it easy. You'll get your<br/>kittens. 
      <p>TEETH<br/>I trust you Mr. Spike.</p></p></center>
<p>Teeth pulls away the stake. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH (cont'd)<br/>That's why I let you gamble the<br/>felines in 
      the first place. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(annoyed)<br/>Oh god, what is with you guys? Why<br/>kittens? 
      Why can't you use money<br/>like normal people? 
      <p>TEETH<br/>She's funny. I like funny in a girl. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(to Teeth)<br/>I just need a little time. 
      <p>TEETH<br/>Time. Time's what turns kittens into<br/>cats.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Teeth motions to his vamp heavies with a nod of his head. They come 
      forward, closing in on Buffy and Spike. 
      <p>Who back up, biding their time. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH (cont'd)<br/>I don't want to see anyone get hurt.</center>
<p>Just as BUFFY GRABS A TREE BRANCH and SWINGS FORWARD, kicking VAMP #1 
      in the face. He staggers back. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Then you better close your eyes.</center>
<p>Buffy drops from the branch. VAMP #2 charges Spike, stake in hand. 
      Buffy steps between them and SOCKS the vampire in the gut. When he's bent 
      over, she CHOPS him on the back of the neck. He crumples to the ground. 
      <p>She picks up his fallen stake, pushes VAMP #1 back. Spike gingerly 
      edges away. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #1<br/>I <u>said</u> she was the Slayer, Boss. 
      <p>TEETH<br/>(to Buffy; genuine)<br/>Good for you. The Vampire 
      Slayer.<br/>Have you given any thought to <br/>freelance work, a little debt 
      <br/>collecting perhaps? I bet you could<br/>really bust up a knee cap or 
      two. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(dry)<br/>No. Thank you.</p></p></center>
<p>Vamp #2 gets to his feet and shuffles over to his boss. Vamp #1 is 
      looking around. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #1<br/>Boss, he's gone; Spike has split.</center>
<p>They all look around. It's true, Spike is gone. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH<br/>That's what I get for socializing. <br/>C'mon boys, up and 
      at'em. We'll<br/>locate Mr. Spike and uh, 'talk' to<br/>him a little 
      more.</center>
<p>The bruised vampires follow him. Teeth makes a little bow towards 
      Buffy. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH (cont'd)<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>It was a genuine 
pleasure.</center>
<p>ANGLE ON TEETH AND THE VAMPS: as they walk away into the mist. 
      <p>On BUFFY looking around, wondering where Spike is. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(to herself)<br/>If I just stopped saving his life it 
      <br/>would simple things up so much.</center>
<p>INT. XANDER'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
      <p>XANDER, ANYA, WILLOW, and TARA sit in gloomy silence. They're drinking 
      coffee, staring into space. Suddenly, breaking the silence: 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Do you think she walked around on<br/>clouds, wearing like, 
      Birkenstocks<br/>and playing a harp? 'Cause those are<br/>just not 
      flattering.</center>
<p>They all turn and stare at her. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>The clonky sandals not the harps.<br/>Who doesn't 
      look good with a harp?<br/>(off their looks) <br/>What? I'm just saying 
      what<br/>everyone's thinking. Right, baby?</center>
<p>She looks to Xander for reassurance. He does the best he can: 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>You are attractive and have many 
      good<br/>qualities.</center>
<p>She gives him a cross look. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>It's totally not stupid to wonder<br/>what it was like for 
      Buffy. But it<br/>could have been any one of a zillion<br/>heavenly 
      dimensions. All we know is<br/>that it was a good place and she 
      was<br/>happy there. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>And we took her away from that. We<br/>wrecked it for her. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>We didn't wreck. We didn't know. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>We didn't want to know. We were so<br/>selfish. I was so 
      selfish. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Maybe we were, but I feel weird<br/>feeling bad that my 
      friend's not <br/>dead. It's too mind-boggling. So<br/>I've decided to 
      simplify the whole<br/>thing: Me like Buffy. Buffy alive. <br/>So, me glad. 
      <p>TARA<br/>Not to be Miss Psycho-pep-squad, but<br/>I think we've got to 
      stop obsessing<br/>about what we did, and start trying<br/>to make things 
      better for Buffy 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I'm with Miss Psycho-pep-squad. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>We should spend more time with her.<br/>Just hang out. Maybe 
      we should do<br/>weekly dinners here. Or a book club,<br/>short books, 
      videos.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow stands. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>(intense)<br/>I can fix it. I know a spell. 
      <p>TARA<br/>No. No more spells. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Then what? This isn't something we<br/>can fix with video 
      clubs. I know I<br/>messed up, okay? And I want to fix<br/>it. 
      <p>TARA<br/>It's too much magic.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Xander senses the tension. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(light)<br/>Alright, alright, I'll read a book.<br/>It's 
      not that I can't read, it's just<br/>my lips get so tired.</center>
<p>Tara ignores Xander. Faces up to Willow. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>I can't believe we're talking about<br/>this again. You 
      know how powerful<br/>magic is. How dangerous. You could<br/>hurt someone. 
      You could hurt <br/>yourself.</center>
<p>Willow leans close to Tara. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I know a spell that would make her<br/>forget she was 
      ever in heaven.</center>
<p>Infuriated, Tara SLAMS her cup of coffee down on the table. It sloshes 
      everywhere. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>What is <u>wrong</u> with you?</center>
<p>Xander stands up and makes his way towards the bedroom. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>I'm just gonna ... answer that phone,<br/>you probably 
      don't hear it, high-<br/>pitched ring, ears like a dog's...</center>
<p>Anya hurries after, pretending to hear the phone too. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Ah yes. I'll help you answer it. </center>
<p>Tara stares down Willow. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>Do you think I'm stupid? I know you<br/>used that spell on 
      me.</center>
<p>Willow is at a loss for words. After a second: 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>I'm sorry. I didn't- 
      <p>TARA<br/>Don't. Just - don't. There's<br/>nothing you can say. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>There is. I never meant to- 
      <p>TARA<br/>To what? Violate my mind like that?<br/>How could you, Willow? 
      How could you<br/>after what Glory did to me? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>'Violate you?' I didn't mean<br/>anything like that. I just 
      wanted<br/>not to fight with you. I love you.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She reaches out to Tara. Who pulls away. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>If you don't want to fight, you don't<br/>fight. You don't 
      use magic to make<br/>a fight disappear. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I wanted to make things better. <br/>Better for us. 
      <p>TARA <br/>But you don't get to decide what's<br/>better for us, Willow. 
      We're in a<br/>relationship; we're supposed to <br/>decide 
together.</p></p></center>
<p>A beat as Willow takes this in. Then- 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Okay. I realize, I did it wrong- 
      <p>TARA<br/>You did it the way you're doing<br/>everything, Will. When 
      things get<br/>rough, you don't even consider your<br/>options - you just do 
      a spell. It's<br/>not good for you - and it's not what<br/>magic is for. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>But I - I'm trying to help people. 
      <p>TARA <br/>Maybe that's how it started, but <br/>you're helping yourself 
      now. Fixing<br/>things to your liking. Including me. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Tara, no... </p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Tara looks off, suddenly really sad. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>I don't think this is working. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Hey. It is. It's working.</p></center>
<p>Willow crouches down by Tara, trying to catch her eye. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>Tara, please. I need you baby. <br/>I need you. 
      I don't need magic. <br/>I don't. Let me prove it to you,<br/>okay? I'll go 
      a month without using<br/>magic. I won't do a single spell, 
      I<br/>swear.</center>
<p>Tara looks at her, her face expressionless, considering. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>Go a week. A week without magic. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(soothing) <br/>Fine, fine. That's easy.</p></center>
<p>Tara isn't comforted. She's stoic, fighting back tears. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>A week and then we'll see. I don't<br/>know. I think we 
      both need some... I<br/>don't know, space. I can't believe<br/>I'm saying 
      this.</center>
<p>They hold each other's eyes. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>You're saying you're gonna leave me?</center>
<p>

      <p>INT. TRAINING ROOM - MORNING 
      <p>Buffy stands before Giles who sits on the couch. She looks stricken. He 
      looks grim and terribly unhappy. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I'm afraid I have to. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Uh-huh. <br/>(then; pissed)<br/>What do you mean 'you have to'? 
      You<br/><u>can't</u>! Giles, this is when I need<br/>you. I'm all messed up. 
      Everything<br/>is all messed up. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I know. But you have to be strong.<br/>I'm trying to-- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>To what? Abandon me, desert me?<br/>Leave me all alone when I 
      really need<br/>somebody, that's great. That's just<br/>really great of you. 

      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy please, this is hard. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yeah, I know, I know. This hurts you<br/>more than it hurts me. 
      And it will<br/>be really hard for you over in jolly<br/>old England, 
      palling around with all<br/>your jolly old friends and riding <br/>around in 
      double decker buses or<br/>whatever the hell you do there. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I don't want to leave- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So don't. Please don't, okay? I<br/>can't do this without you. 
      <p>GILES<br/>But you can. That's why I'm going.<br/>As long as I stay, when 
      things arise<br/>that you feel you can't handle,<br/>you'll turn to me. And 
      I'll step in, <br/>because... Because I hate to see you<br/>suffer. 
      <p>BUFFY<br< about<br="" had="" hate="" me="" suffering.="" too.=""> as much of it as I can 
      take- 
      <p>GILES<br/>And I'm loathe to cause you any more, believe me. But this 
      is...</p></br<></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>This is the hardest thing to say. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>In every mentor relationship, there's<br/>a point 
      when the student must kill<br/>the teacher-<br/>(off her 
      glare)<br/>Metaphorically.<br/>(then)<br/>What I'm saying.... I've taught 
      you<br/>everything you need know about being<br/>the slayer. And your mother 
      taught<br/>you everything you need know about<br/>life. But you won't 
      believe it until<br/>you're forced to stand alone. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>But why now? Now that you know where <br/>I've been. What I'm 
      dealing with- 
      <p>GILES<br/>Now more than ever. The temptation<br/>to give up must be 
      powerful. I<br/>can't let that happen. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>So I won't. No giving up. You can<br/>be here and I can still 
      be strong.<br/>I don't have to depend on you as much<br/>as I have. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Buffy. I've thought this over. And<br/>over. I think it's the 
      right thing.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She stands up. Really hurt and mad. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You're wrong. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I don't think so. I hope not.</p></center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S FOYER - MORNING 
      <p>DAWN and Tara stand at the bottom of the stairs. They're wearing 
      jackets. Tara looks weary. Dawn bellows up the stairs: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Willow! Get the lead out. 
      <p>WILLOW (O.S.)<br/>Coming. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(to Tara)<br/>What's does that mean anyway? Get<br/>what lead out 
      of where? 
      <p>TARA<br/>Cars. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Oh. For some reason I always<br/>pictured mechanical 
      pencils.<br/>(yelling)<br/>Wil-low! C'mon! You ready?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow appears at the top of the stairs. Fresh out of the shower, she's 
      wrapped in a towel with another around her head. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Not so much. You go ahead. Tell<br/>Giles to hold up, I'm 
      there in a sec. 
      <p>TARA<br/>Fine.</p></center>
<p>ANGLE ON DAWN AND TARA as they head out the door. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Hurry up, you don't wanna miss the<br/>lowdown on our 
      latest featured<br/>creature.</center>
<p>Tara nudges her out the door. 
      <p>Now, in a LOCK DOWN SHOT, we ANGLE up the stairs at WILLOW at the top. 
      She waits a moment to make sure they're gone. Then she heads towards her 
      bedroom, out of our sight... and IMMEDIATELY REAPPEARS. SHE IS FULLY 
      DRESSED, HAIR DRY, MADE-UP AND READY. (It's like magic!!) She heads down 
      the stairs and enters the living room. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Where she glances at AN OLD PHOTO OF BUFFY looking happy. 
      <p>Willow reaches the bookshelf and pulls back a few books. There, 
      secreted behind the volumes, is a ziplock bag containing dried LETHE'S 
      BRAMBLE. She pulls it out, replaces the books. 
      <p>She kneels by the fireplace and pulls out four sprigs of the dried 
      weed. She ignites them with a fireplace match and tosses them into the 
      fireplace. 
      <p>They smolder, producing a dense, foul smoke. She watches for a second, 
      then tosses in a fifth weed for good measure. 
      <p>

<p>She takes A PURE WHITE CRYSTAL from the breast pocket of her shirt and 
      touches it to the burning herbs. It immediately turns a pale gray. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/><i>'When the fire goes out. When the<br/>crystal 
      turns black. The spell will<br/>be cast. Tabula rasa. Tabula

<p>She stands. Gives the fire a final look. Returns the crystal to her 
      pocket. And heads to the door. 
      <p>ANGLE ON the bag of weed, left carelessly near the fireplace. Too 
      close. As the fire grows, it engulfs the bag. Burning ALL of the Lethe's 
      Bramble. Smoke rising. 
      <p>INT. MAGIC BOX - MORNING 
      <p>Tara, Dawn, Anya and Giles are sitting around the table. 
      <p>Buffy sits apart from the others, staring into space. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>So what do we got? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Sorry? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>What kind of oogly-booglys? Lizardy-<br/>types, or zombies, or 
      vampires or<br/>what? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Dawn. There are no 'oogly-booglys'.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Just then the door opens and Xander enters with Willow. She is wearing 
      his jacket--A VARSITY-TYPE LETTERMAN'S JACKET WITH 'HARRIS' EMBROIDERED ON 
      THE CHEST. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>(to Xander, re: jacket)<br/>Thanks, it's cold out 
      there.</center>
<p>Xander, having given up his jacket, shivers in agreement. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Not a problem. The cold only makes<br/>me stronger and 
      more macho-like. 
      <p>GILES<br/>I'm glad you're here.</p></center>
<p>He stands. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>I have something I really have to<br/>tell you 
      all. I know it seems like <br/>we've been through this but-- </center>
<p>Suddenly, Buffy stands. She's on the verge of angry tears. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Why don't you jump to the chase,<br/>Giles? Just tell them 
      that you're-</center>
<p>But just as she's about to say it, the front door bangs open and SPIKE 
      comes flying in. He's flushed and panting and dressed in the TWEEDY-SUIT 
      he wore in "Restless" and a HAT WITH EARFLAPS. He SLAMS the door, closing 
      Buffy in. Smiles nervously, talks fast. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Fancy meeting you here. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Spike? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Holy moly. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>You need to give me asylum. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I'll say.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike crosses to the counter and hops up, doffing his earflappy hat. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>No need to get cute. It's a<br/>disguise. Thrift shop 
      number. <br/>Happens there's a bloke I'd rather<br/>not see just now.<br/>(to 
      Buffy)<br/>You met him, I believe. The toothy<br/>bloke with the baby seal 
      breath? </center>
<p>Everyone stares at Spike. Off their looks of incredulity: 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING - SAME TIME 
      <p>The last dying embers of the burning weeds. They're almost out. 
      <p>INT. MAGIC BOX - MORNING - SAME TIME 
      <p>Discreetly, Willow pulls the crystal from her pocket and checks it. IT 
      IS BLACK AS TAR. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Alright, then. If we've recovered<br/>from Spike's 
      sartorial humor...</center>
<p>He looks to Buffy, whose face is tight, pained. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>(looks to Buffy) <br/>I will jump. To the chase. 
      I'm<br/>heading back to England and I plan on<br/>staying. Indefinitely. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Now? Not now, not right<br/>after... everything.</p></center>
<p>Giles sits down. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Yes, now- 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(to Giles; pointed)<br/>For real this time? 'Cause honest 
      to<br/>Pete, a young shopkeeper's heart can<br/>only be broken so many 
      times. I<br/>mean, not that I want you to--</p></center>
<p>Buffy, distraught, starts heading for the door. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY <br/>I - I can't do this. I gotta... You<br/>guys just- 
      </center>
<p>Willow moves to her. Puts a hand on her. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Buffy. I... listen. I know this must<br/>be awful for 
      you. And I'm sorry, so<br/>sorry, for what we put you--</center>
<p>Buffy turns on Willow, finally breaking down. Her pain palpable. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I'm sorry. Everybody's sorry. And I<br/>know you're trying 
      to help me. But<br/>it's all too much, Will. The<br/>memories, they hurt. I 
      can't take it<br/>anymore. </center>
<p>INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING - SAME TIME 
      <p>Back on the burning weeds. They're out. 
      <p>INT. MAGIC BOX - SAME TIME 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>If you understood how it felt - how<br/>it feels now... 
      It's like I'm dying <br/>in-</center>
<p>Buffy suddenly closes her eyes, as if she's going to faint, and 
      CRUMPLES TO HER KNEES. 
      <p>A WIDER SHOT REVEALS: Everyone is doing the same thing. THEY FALL 
      ASLEEP.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT 
      <p>The sun has set and the shop is dark. Moonlight and street lamps 
      provide the only light. It's a peaceful scene. 
      <p>PANNING ACROSS THE SHOP: 
      <p>Anya and Giles sitting at the table. Anya's head resting on Giles' 
      shoulder, his head on hers. 
      <p>Tara sleeps in her chair, curled up in a blissful ball of extra 
      cuteness. 
      <p>Spike lies on the counter top, his hands behind his head. 
      <p>Willow and Xander are snuggled together, his jacket still wrapped 
      around her. 
      <p>Dawn is curled up on the floor. 
      <p>Buffy has fallen asleep on the floor by the front door. 
      <p>CLOSE ON BUFFY as her eyes blink open. She sits up, stretches, yawns. 
      Then suddenly freezes: she has no idea where she is. She squints, trying 
      desperately to remember... anything. Slowly, carefully, she gets to her 
      feet. SHE TURNS ON A LIGHT. And looks around the room at the sleeping 
      strangers. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Huh.</center>
<p>ANGLE ON WILLOW as she awakes. She looks at Xander Yikes! Who's this 
      guy and what's he doing snuggled next to her? She jerks back with a little 
      yelp. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Uhh!</center>
<p>Which wakes Xander. He YELPS. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Uhh!</center>
<p>Looks at Willow, and, covering for his ignorance, forces a casual 
      smile. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Hey.</center>
<p>Willow doesn't 'fess up either. Smiles back uncomfortably. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>Hey?</center>
<p>ON TARA as she stretches like a satisfied cat after a nap --then opens 
      her eyes. Satisfaction turns to embarrassment. Then confusion. 
      <p>ON ANYA AND GILES as they come to. Look at each other curiously. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Hello.</center>
<p>ON SPIKE as he, still sleeping, falls off the counter. As he hits the 
      ground: 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>AAAaaa!</center>
<p>ON DAWN as Spike's yell wakes her. She looks around and: 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>AAAAAA!</center>
<p>Everyone is awake now. Dawn is terrified. She glances around, her eyes 
      wide with panic. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd)<br/>Who, who are you guys?</center>
<p>Buffy goes to Dawn. Reaches out to her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Hey, don't worry. </center>
<p>Dawn shirks away. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Please don't hurt me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's okay. I don't know anyone here<br/>either. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(suspicious)<br/>Yeah? Who are you?</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy's caught off guard. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I...nm, I--</center>
<p>Suddenly Xander leaps to his feet and: 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(to everyone)<br/>Who are you freaks? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>You don't know me? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>I don't have a clue. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(hurt)<br/>But you just acted all, 'Hey.' 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Yeah, 'cause I thought you were a<br/>girl and I'd remember in 
      a second<br/>but-- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I am a girl. I'm... <br/>(realizing)<br/>not sure who I am. 
      Exactly. But-- 
      <p>XANDER<br/>(paranoid)<br/>Okay... why was I on the ground? And<br/>why are 
      you all staring at me? Is<br/>this some kind of psych test? Am I<br/>getting 
      paid for this? Is this a bad<br/>dream?</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He pinches himself. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Yow, okay, no. Am I in trouble? I<br/>didn't do 
      it! And if I did, it was<br/>an accident. 
      <p>GILES <br/>(to Xander)<br/>It's not just you. Does anyone<br/>remember 
      anything? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Nope.</p></p></center>
<p>They shake their heads. They're gathering around the table now. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Perhaps we all got terribly drunk and<br/>we're having 
      some kind of black-out. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I don't think I d-drink.</p></center>
<p>She's trying really hard not to cry. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>I don't see any booze; I don't feel<br/>any head bumps; and 
      I don't see Alan<br/>Funt.</center>
<p>Xander is trying equally hard not to panic. He takes deep breaths. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Okay... I'm not panicking, I'm not,<br/>I'm not. Stop 
      looking at me like I'm<br/>panicking. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Hey, take it easy, guy. No one's<br/>hurt, right? And none of 
      us looks<br/>all hatchet murder-y, so we're<br/>probably safe. Here. 
      Wherever here<br/>is. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Look at the things on these shelves:<br/>weird jars of weird 
      stuff and weird<br/>books with weird covers like:<br/>(reading)<br/>'Magic 
      for beginners'. Oh. 
      <p>TARA<br/>(awed)<br/>A magic shop. A real magic shop. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Maybe that's it. Maybe something magic<br/>happened to us. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(scoffing)<br/>Magic? Magic is all balderdash<br/>and chicanery. 
      I'm afraid we don't know <br/>a bloody thing.<br/>(re: his accent)<br/>Except 
      I seem to be British, don't I?<br/>And a man. With glasses. Well, 
      that<br/>narrows it down considerably. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I don't like this.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Dawn is starting to cry, just a little bit. Buffy puts her arm around 
      her. This time Dawn lets her. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Listen, it's going to be okay. We'll<br/>take care of each 
      other, okay?</center>
<p>Dawn nods at Buffy through her tears. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Yes, we'll get back our memories and<br/>everything will 
      be right as rain. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(disgusted)<br/>Oh listen to Mary Poppins! Got his<br/>crust all 
      stiff and upper with that <br/>nancy-boy accent. You Englishmen 
      are<br/>always so --<br/>(hearing himself)<br/>Bloody 
      hell.<br/>(testing)<br/>Sodding blimy shagging knickers<br/>bullocks -- oh 
      no.<br/>(horrified) <br/>I'm English. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Welcome to the nancy tribe.</p></p></center>
<p>Spike eyes Giles up and down, a horrible thought creeping in. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You don't suppose... you and I...<br/>we' re not related, 
      are we? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>There is a ruggedly handsome<br/>resemblance.</p></center>
<p>Giles looks at Spike, dismayed. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>And you do inspire a particular<br/>feeling of 
      familiarity... and<br/>disappointment.<br/>(weakly, re: himself) <br/>Older 
      brother? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(eyeing them)<br/>Well, I'm thinking more like -- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Father! <br/>(glares)<br/>My god how I must hate you. 
      <p>GILES<br/>What did I do? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Oh, there's always something. And<br/>what's with the 
      trollop?</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He indicates Anya 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Hey! 
      <p>GILES<br/>Her? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>I saw you... <u>sleeping</u> together. 
      <p>GILES<br/><u>Resting</u> together! 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Look!</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She displays her engagement ring! 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>It's okay, we're engaged.</center>
<p>Giles looks at her, shyly. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Oh.</center>
<p>Anya smiles back, shy too. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>It's a lovely ring. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Great, a tarty step-Mum who's half<br/>ol' Daddy's age. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Tarty! 
      <p>GILES<br/>Old! I'm young enough to still get<br/>carded-- 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Carded! Driver's licenses!</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>They all scramble through their pockets. Xander holds up his license. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Look! Me! Alexander Harris.<br/>(re: license)<br/>Cute 
      picture. Hey, I exist! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I'm Willow Rosenberg. 'Willow'!<br/>Funny name. 
      <p>TARA<br/>I think it's pretty. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(re: license) <br/>What do you got? 
      <p>TARA<br/>Tara. And look, I'm a student at UC<br/>Sunnydale. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Me too! Maybe we're study buddies. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>(to Buffy; sad)<br/>I don't have a wallet. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Don't worry, me neither. But here...</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She touches Dawn's 'nameplate' necklace. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>You're 'Dawn'.</center>
<p>Dawn looks at the necklace, reads it upside-down. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Or 'Umad'.</center>
<p>They smile. 
      <p>ANGLE ON GILES as he goes through his billfold. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I'm called, let's see, 'Rupert Giles'. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(swoony)<br/>Rupert. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(smirky)<br/>Rupert. 
      <p>GILES<br/>You're not too old to take over my<br/>knee... Son. What did I 
      call you<br/>anyway?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike pats his back pocket, no wallet. Nothing in his interior pocket 
      either. Then he reads a label inside: 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>'Made with care for Randy'.<br/>(aghast)<br/>'Randy' 
      Giles?! Why didn't you just<br/>name me 'Horny Giles' or 
      'Desperate-<br/>for-a-shag Giles'? I knew there was<br/>a reason I hated 
      you! 
      <p>GILES<br/>(defensive)<br/>Randy's a family name. Undoubtedly. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I've got a name on my jacket too.</p></p></center>
<p>Reading the embroidery over her heart. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>'Harris'. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Harris? That's my last name. Hey,<br/>maybe I have a brother 
      and you go out<br/>with him.<br/>(then)<br/>... or, maybe you go out with me. 

      <p>WILLOW<br/>We did wake up all snuggly wuggly.<br/>I guess maybe you're my 
      boyfriend. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Either that or I have one pissed off<br/>brother out there 
      somewhere.</p></p></p></center>
<p>They smile at each other. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (O.S.)<br/>I'm Anya!</center>
<p>ANGLE ON ANYA at the front door, testing a key on the interior lock. 
      She pronounces her name 'Ann-ya'. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>My key fits the lock and I found some<br/>forms by the 
      register that say Rupert<br/>and Anya own the shop 
      together.<br/>(proud)<br/>That's me. Anya Shop-owner. 
      <p>GILES<br/>(glancing about)<br/>This is our magic shop? Well,<br/>that's... 
      very progressive of me. <br/>You know it truly is a small mind<br/>that 
      fails to acknowledge the, um,<br/>alternatives to our 
      rational,<br/>scientific understanding of the<br/>universe. <br/>(changing 
      subject)<br/>Oh look! Fancy herbs!</p></center>
<p>ON BUFFY AND DAWN 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>So you don't have a name? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Of course I do. I just don't happen<br/>to know it. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>You want me to name you? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>That's sweet, but I think I can name<br/>myself. I'll name me.. 
      Joan.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Dawn recoils. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Ug! 
      <p>BUFFY (hurt)<br/>What? Why'd you 'ug' my name? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>I didn't. It's just so.. .blarg.<br/>'Joan'? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I like it. I feel like a Joan. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Fine. That's your purgative. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(correcting)<br/>Prerogative. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Whatever. 'Joan'. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Whatever. 'Umad'.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>

<table width="60%">

<center>DAWN<br/>Boy you're bossy.

<p>An idea strikes them both. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Do you think we're-- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Sisters.</p></center>
<p>It feels so true they can't deny it. They grin. And hug. 
      <p>ANGLE ON SPIKE AND GILES. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You never showed me affection like<br/>that. I'd wager. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We've got to figure out what's going<br/>on. We need to get 
      help. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Looks like 'Joan' fancies herself the<br/>boss.</p></p></center>
<p>Buffy ignores him. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>We've got a kid here-- 
      <p>DAWN<br/>A teenager. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>A teenager, and we have no idea<br/>what's wrong with us. I 
      think a <br/>hospital's our best bet. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Alright then, let's head out.</p></p></p></center>
<p>As they head to the door. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Any suggestions on how we get there? 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Dad can drive. He's bound to have<br/>some classic mid-life 
      crisis<br/>transport: something red, sporty,<br/>shaped like a 
      penis.</p></center>
<p>As they open the front door and find: 
      <p>VAMP #1 and VAMP #2. They SNARL and CHARGE! 
      <p>
<center>ALL<br/>AAAAAAAaaaaaa!!!! 
      <p>VAMP #1<br/>Slayer!</p></center>
<p>They SLAM the door just in time. And: 
      <p>
<center>ALL<br/>AAAAAAaaaaa!!!! 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Did you see what I-- 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Vampires!</p></p></center>
<p>They crouch down behind the door, scared witless. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>Maybe it's Halloween. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Doesn't feel like Halloween. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Even if it is, those were definitely<br/>not kids and they 
      were definitely not<br/>wearing costumes. Randy's right. We<br/>got 
      vampires!</p></p></center>
<p>The vampires BANG on the door, RATTLING the doorknob. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>And I don't think they're knockin'<br/>for 
      candy. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Doors! We should check for other<br/>doors, make sure they're 
      locked and<br/>then put big heavy things in front of<br/>them! Come 
      on!</p></center>
<p>She grabs Xander and disappears into the back of the shop. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>(processing)<br/>Monsters are real... Did we know<br/>this? 

      <p>TARA<br/>I don't know. We n-need our memories back! <br/>We have to get 
      to the hospital! 
      <p>GILES<br/>(bravely) <br/>Speaking as the proprietor of a Magic<br/>Shop, I 
      propose we fight back. We<br/>can use things here in the shop,<br/>magic... 
      tricks or whatever they call--</p></p></center>
<p>VAMP #1 SLAMS UP AGAINST THE FRONT WINDOW as VAMP #2 continues to BANG 
      and RATTLE the front door. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #1<br/>(through the window) <br/>Send out Spike! 
      <p>GILES<br/>They seem to want spikes. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Oh, I saw some...</p></p></center>
<p>He scooches over to Giles' desk and grabs A HANDFUL OF STAKES among the 
      clutter. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Here. Let's give 'em these. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Wait. What are they going to do-- 
      <p>VAMP #2 (O.S.)<br/>Slayer! Come out and play! 
      <p>TARA<br/>Slay her! That's just what they said<br/>before. They're going 
      to use those<br/>spikes-- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>To slay someone. A female someone!<br/>(pissed)<br/>Who do those 
      jerks think they are? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Bloodsuckers, that kill, by sucking<br/>blood. Take it easy, 
      Joan.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Spike puts the stakes in his jacket pocket. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (O.S.)<br/>You guys! </center>
<p>Willow and Xander come running back, breathless. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>There's a trapdoor in the basement,<br/>seems to lead to 
      the sewer. 
      <p>ANYA <br/>Let's go. </p></center>
<p>They head for the basement, just as VAMP #1 BUSTS THROUGH THE WINDOW. 
      <p>Everyone freezes. Vamp #1 strides around them, blocking their exit. 
      Scared, they scurry into the front corner. 
      <p>Vamp #2 BREAKS THROUGH THE DOOR. They're trapped. Xander gets down on 
      his knees and genuflects. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(to god)<br/>Now I'm not sure what I am, so bear<br/>with 
      me here, okay? Um, Now I lay me<br/>down to sleep... Shema 
      Israel...uh,<br/>Ohm, Ohm.</center>
<p>Vamp #1 starts BREAKING THINGS, YANKS THE PHONE FROM THE WALL. VAMP #2 
      gets in Spike's face. Pushing him against the wall. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #2<br/>You owe us!</center>
<p>Spike grabs the stakes in his pocket and TOSSES THEM AT THE VAMPIRE'S 
      FEET. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Fine! Take the damn spikes!</center>
<p>The vamp SNARLS as the stakes CLATTER. Takes a step closer. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #2<br/>Don't be stupid.</center>
<p>SUDDENLY, VAMP #1 GRABS BUFFY FROM BEHIND, holding her in the air. She 
      wriggles and kicks her legs. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Let go 'a me, you big, nasty--</center>
<p>HE CLAMPS A HAND OVER HER MOUTH. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #2<br/>(to Spike) <br/>I said, you owe us! 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Who, me? 
      <p>VAMP #2 You got the boss' kittens! 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Kittens?</p></p></p></center>
<p>Fed up, VAMP #2 LUNGES AT SPIKE! 
      <p>JUST AS BUFFY <u>CHOMPS DOWN</u> ON VAMP #1's HAND. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #1<br/>Bitch!</center>
<p>SHE KICKS HIM IN THE GROIN. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #1 (cont'd)<br/>Argh!</center>
<p>In pain, VAMP #1 DROPS HER, STAGGERS BACK. 
      <p>Buffy hits the ground. Instinctively GRABS A STAKE: 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Stay away from Randy!</center>
<p>AND STAKES Vamp #2. <u>HE TURNS TO DUST</u>. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Whoa! 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>(to Buffy, amazed)<br/>What did you just do?</p></center>
<p>Buffy looks as shocked as the rest of them. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I don't know.</center>
<p>Suddenly, she grins, a great big, proud as hell grin. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>But it was cool.</center>
<p>Vamp #1 JUMPS BACK OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW as he does: 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #1<br/>The boss ain't going to like this.<br/>I'll be back and 
      I won't be alone.</center>
<p>Spike goes to the front of the shop and and PULLS A METAL security gate 
      across the entrance. 
      <p>Buffy feels her bicep, in awe of her own strength. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>I think I know why Joan's the boss.<br/>I'm like a 
      superhero or something.</center>
<p>OMITTED 
      <p>OMITTED 
      <p>EXT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT - LATER 
      <p>FOUR VAMPIRES, INCLUDING VAMP #1, surround the magic shop. Teeth is 
      with them now, pacing as always. He extracts a long cigarette from a 
      silver case. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #1<br/>The boys want to taste blood Boss.<br/>They want to 
      break down the door. 
      <p>TEETH<br/>The 'boys' are barbarians. There's<br/>no need for that. The 
      humans will<br/>turn on him soon enough. And if not...</p></center>
<p>As he lights his cigarette: 
      <p>
<center>TEETH (cont'd)<br/>We'll burn the place to the ground.</center>
<p>INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy peers out the barred window, looking at the gang of vamps. She 
      turns around, faces the gang. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Okay, I've got a plan. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>All ears. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>They seem to want Randy. And I seem<br/>to be pretty strong. 
      Wicked strong.<br/>So, while you all go through the<br/>sewer and find the 
      hospital, Randy<br/>and I'll take the monsters for a run. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>That's your plan? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yes. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>Right. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>I'm not leaving the shop. I need to<br/>protect the cash 
      register and... do<br/>spells. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Perhaps magic can help us. It's worth<br/>a shot. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Alright. You two work on that then.<br/>We gotta go. Ready 
      Randy?</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>He nods, aware of the danger. Deadly serious. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Ready Joan.</center>
<p>They head for the door but are stopped by: 
      <p>
<center>GILES (O.S.)<br/>Son?</center>
<p>Spike turns. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Come here please.</center>
<p>He embraces Spike. They hug, very stiffly, clapping each other on the 
      back. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Right. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Good then.</p></center>
<p>Hastily, embarrassed by this outpouring of emotion, they push each 
      other away. 
      <p>And Buffy and Spike THROW OPEN THE DOOR and run right through the pack 
      of vampires. 
      <p>EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF MAGIC BOX - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Catching the four vampires off guard, Buffy and Spike are able to get 
      by them. But not for long, the vampires give chase. Teeth watches as they 
      go, taking a drag from his cig. 
      <p>Within a few seconds, the gang is upon Spike and Buffy. One of the 
      vampires GRABS SPIKE. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Randy!</center>
<p>Spike THROWS A PUNCH AT THE VAMP and as he does, he morphs into 
      VAMP-FACE. POW! 
      <p>The Vamp goes flying, totally airborne. Spike turns to Buffy, delighted 
      at his unexpected display of super strength. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Hey! I'm a superhero, too?</center>
<p>Buffy spots Spike's vamped noggin. She freezes for a stunned second -- 
      then turns tail and takes off running. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>(calling, confused)<br/>Joan! Where ya 
      goin'?</center>

      <p>Spike fights the four vampires. He throws a few punches, then: 
      <p>He grabs two of them, slams them together; their skulls collide 
      audibly. He throws them at the remaining two vamps, knocking the whole 
      snarling mess to the ground. 
      <p>Spike takes off running, chasing after Buffy 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Hey Joan, wait up!</center>
<p>INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander and Tara are down in the sewer, waiting at the bottom of a very 
      long ladder. Dawn is making her way down. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Almost there.</center>
<p>Dawn gets to the bottom rung. There's a three-foot drop to the ground. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER (cont'd)<br/>Here.</center>
<p>He extends a hand. Dawn accepts it and he leads her down to the ground. 

      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>Thank you.</center>
<p>Willow's at the bottom rung now. Xander extends his hand, but WILLOW 
      INSTINCTIVELY REACHES FOR TARA AT THE SAME TIME TARA REACHES FOR WILLOW. 
      <p>Tara guides Willow down. They pause a moment, still holding hands. Then 
      release them. 
      <p>They look at the different tunnels. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (cont'd) <br/>Which way? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>All directions look equally dank and<br/>stinky.</p></center>
<p>Tara points in one direction. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>How 'bout this dank and stinky way? 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Sounds great.</p></center>
<p>They troop off in that direction. Into the darkness. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN<br/>(singing softly) <br/>The ants go marching one by 
      one.<br/>Hurrah! Hurrah! The ants go<br/>marching one by one, hurrah, 
      hur-<br/>AAAAH!</center>
<p>As out of the shadows A VAMPIRE (VAMP #3) emerges. 
      <p>Off our groups' expressions of fear: 
      <p>INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT 
      <p>Giles and Anya stand beside an empty table. Anya holds a big leather 
      book to her chest. Giles is holding a much larger stack of books. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Let's do some magic.</center>
<p>They smile at each other. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>I picked out a fine dusty selection<br/>of 
      interesting-looking texts.</center>
<p>Giles starts setting his books down on the table, displaying them one 
      by one. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>This must be nice for us. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Sorry?</p></center>
<p>As Giles sets down his last book he notices something in his suit 
      jacket pocket. Unseen by Anya, he takes it out and looks at it: a single 
      plane ticket. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>I mean, I know there's the vampire<br/>problem and our 
      memory loss and all<br/>that, but still. To spend this time<br/>together. 
      Alone. It must be nice.</center>
<p>Giles tucks the ticket away again. Still distracted. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Uh.. Yes, quite right. So, which<br/>book shall we start 
      with?</center>
<p>Anya plops the book she was holding onto the table. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>This is the book for us. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Oh good, it focuses on mind control or<br/>memory loss? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Not exactly. I just...my intuition<br/>tells me this is the 
      book. And I<br/>figure being a magic shop owner and<br/>a natural at the 
      supernatural, I<br/>should trust my intuition. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Fine. But as you'll recall, I too<br/>own a magic shop. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>True. But, my intuition says you're<br/>not so much the 'magic 
      guy' and more<br/>of a paperwork type. 
      <p>GILES<br/>A paperwork type! 
      <p>ANYA<br/>You probably sweep up too. Now, here<br/>we go.</p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She opens the book at random and begins to incant: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>But you don't even know what you're-- 
      <p>ANYA<br/>(reading)<br/><i>'Bara Bare Himble Gemination!'</i></p></center>
<p>And POOF! A WHITE RABBIT APPEARS ON THE TABLE! 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>AAAAAAaaaaa!</center>
<p>Giles stares at her, appalled. 
      <p>EXT. SUNNYDALE STREETS - NIGHT 
      <p>ON SPIKE, still in vamp-face, as he charges after Buffy Trying 
      desperately to catch up with her. Running into a residential neighborhood. 

      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Wait up!</center>
<p>Spike catches up to her, puts out an arm... He catches her by the 
      elbow, spins her around. 
      <p>Instinctively and smoothly, Buffy uses her momentum to flip Spike 
      backwards, launching herself forward onto him at the same time. 
      <p>She ends up straddling him, pinning his hands to the ground on either 
      side of his head. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>Bloody hell! What're you doing? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>(realizing)<br/>You don't know who you are. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(patiently)<br/>Right. None of us do. And we're<br/>being chased 
      by the fiendy-- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>You're a vampire. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>(insulted)<br/>How could you...<br/>(then, thinking)<br/>I... me 
      a vampire... Nah... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Check out the lumpies... and the<br/>teeth.</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>She sits back, releasing his hands, but still atop him. 
      <p>He reaches up, FEELING THE BUMPY RIDGES OF HIS FACE like a blind man. 
      He runs his tongue over his fangs. Absorbing this. Then puts his fingers 
      to his throat: no pulse. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>I kill your kind. 
      <p>SPIKE<br/>And I bite yours.</p></center>
<p>He looks at her and his ferocious expression melts. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>So why don't I want to bite you? And<br/>why am I 
      fighting other vampires?<br/>(then; realizing)<br/>I must be a noble 
      vampire. A good<br/>guy. On a mission of redemption.<br/>I help the 
      hopeless. I'm a vampire<br/>with a soul!</center>
<p>Buffy gives him a look. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Oh my god, 'a vampire with a soul'?!<br/>How lame is 
      that?</center>
<p>INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT 
      <p>Bunnies (say, 5 or 6 of 'em?) hop everywhere. Anya stands on a chair, 
      terrified. Giles tries to contain his exasperation. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>(forced patience)<br/>Perhaps we should try another book. 
      <p>ANYA <br/>No! This book made the little<br/>fluffers, this book's gonna 
      send 'em<br/>away. I've got it this time.</p></center>
<p>Anya continues to incant from the same spell book but in the 
      high-pitched tones of panic. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/><i>'Himble abri. Abri Voyon. </i></center>
<p>Another bunny pops into existence. 
      <p>
<center>GILES <br/>Yes, dear. </center>
<p>EXT. SUNNYDALE STREETS - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike is standing up now, pacing, expounding on his identity. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>I'm a hero, really. I mean, to be <br/>cast such an ugly 
      lot but then to <br/>rise above it, to seek better, nobler<br/>things. It's 
      inspiring, in'it?</center>
<p>He looks at Buffy who is watching him, expressionless. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>And the two of us! Natural enemies<br/>thrown 
      together to stand against the<br/>forces of darkness! Utter trust! 
      No<br/>thought of me biting you. No thought<br/>of you staking me... 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Kinda depends on how long you keep on <br/>yakking-- 
      <br/>(hearing something) <br/>What's that?</p></center>
<p>ANGLE ON the vampire gang (Vamp #1 plus 3 others) approaching. 
      <p>BACK TO BUFFY AND SPIKE. They stand together against the forces of 
      darkness. 
      <p>INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander, Dawn, Tara, and Willow run from the vampire (Vamp #3). They 
      duck into an alley and watch as the vampire runs past. 
      <p>
<center>TARA<br/>C'mon. This way. Up the ladder.</center>
<p>Quickly, they dart across the main path and scramble up a ladder built 
      into the side of the sewer tunnel. 
      <p>The ladder leads to an old pipe built along the concrete wall: 4' 
      diameter, 8' long. Once used as part of the sewage network, the pipe is 
      now empty save for a few scraps of wood. A perfect, albeit cozy, hiding 
      place. They can look out either end, but inside they're completely hidden. 

      <p>Tara enters first, Willow, Dawn, then Xander. 
      <p>Xander peeks out and quickly pulls his head back in. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>(a whisper)<br/>He's coming.</center>
<p>They hold their breath, waiting. 
      <p>ANGLE ON THE VAMPIRE walking back through the tunnels, methodically 
      checking for the humans. 
      <p>INSIDE THE PIPE Tara and Willow are pressed close together. Their faces 
      are only inches apart. THEIR BREATH AUDIBLE. They catch each other's eyes. 
      Tara looks away. And then back. Another second and then Willow looks down, 
      embarrassed by the intensity. And then back. Holding it. 
      <p>ANGLE ON VAMP #3 as he passes by, oblivious. 
      <p>INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT 
      <p>Anya atop the table now, still panicking, still with the book. The shop 
      is in total chaos. Bunnies (can we have, like, two dozen?) run rampant. 
      The ceiling seems to be gone, replaced by SWIRLING GREEN MYSTICAL SMOKE 
      (CGI). 
      <p>Giles is about to burst at the seams. Through gritted teeth: 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>That is clearly not a helpful book,<br/>dear. Come down 
      and we'll go about<br/>fixing this in a sensible fashion. 
      <p>ANYA <br/>Sensible?! You think it's <u>sensible</u><br/>for me to go down 
      into that pit of<br/>cotton-top hell and let them hippity-<br/>hop all over 
      my vulnerable flesh? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Fine. Stay there and make bunnies.<br/>That's a capital plan. 
      <p>ANYA<br/>What? Capital? I never know what<br/>you're talking about. Loo, 
      shag<br/>brolly: what the hell is all that? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Look, there's no way you remember me<br/>saying any of those 
      words-- 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Oh bugger off, you.. brolly!</p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>EXT. SUNNYDALE STREETS - NIGHT 
      <p>Buffy and Spike face off with the same FOUR VAMPIRES Spike got away 
      from earlier. Tense.

      But you know? You still<br/>haven't paid me my kittens. And<br/>that's okay 
      too.</center>
<p>He steps aside. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH (cont'd)<br/>Because you'll pay me now. At 
      'em,<br/>boys!</center>
<p>AND THE VAMPIRES ATTACK! 
      <p>Two jump Spike while the other two take on Buffy 
      <p>BUFFY deals out a couple blows before getting SOCKED IN THE JAW. She 
      rallies, KICKS BACK. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Note to self: learn to duck.</center>
<p>She breaks off a nearby mailbox and DUSTS A VAMP with the mailbox post 
      (<u>ON CAMERA</u>). 
      <p>Spike HEADBUTTS another vampire. Who collapses. Spike pulls a STAKE 
      from his jacket and DUSTS HIM, <u>OFF CAMERA</u>. 
      <p>ANGLE ON BUFFY, getting in some good punches. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY (cont'd)<br/>Check me out.</center>
<p>Buffy KICKS a vamp, who staggers towards Spike. Spike lands a RIGHT 
      HOOK, and the vamp ricochets back to Buffy. 
      <p>ANGLE ON SPIKE AND BUFFY fighting together. He sets 'em up, she knocks 
      'em down. 
      <p>INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT 
      <p>A lone bunny in the foreground. 
      <p>Giles is feverishly swordfighting with an animated skeleton. Anya is 
      off-screen, incanting random words from the book. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>(to Anya, distinctly)<br/>Get a different book. Put that 
      book<br/>down. Do you hear me? Not that<br/>book. Bad book. Bad book! 
      </center>
<p>INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT 
      <p>Xander is keeping watch out his end of the pipe. Tara does likewise at 
      hers. In the middle of the pipe, Willow turns to Dawn. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW<br/>How ya doin', Dawn? 
      <p>DAWN<br/>Okay. It's scary. But weirdly?<br/>Kind of familiar. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I know what you mean. 
      <p>DAWN<br/>How are you? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>A little confused. I mean, I'm<br/>sweaty, I'm trapped, no 
      memory,<br/>hiding in a pipe, from a vampire -</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>Willow glances at Xander and then at Tara. 
      <p>
<center>WILLOW (cont'd)<br/>I think I'm kind of gay.</center>
<p>INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT 
      <p>Giles and Anya are hiding behind the counter. Anya still clutches the 
      spell book. We stay tight on them as some UNSEEN CREATURE manifested by a 
      spell GROWLS and SNARLS in the magic shop. 
      <p>Giles peeks above the counter and then ducks back. The following 
      conversation is all in a loud whisper. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Look what you've done now, you<br/>lunatic woman! 
      <p>ANYA <br/>Don't blame me. You're a snobby,<br/>snotty, 
      thinks-he's-so-great kind of<br/>jerk and I feel compelled to TAKE<br/>SOME 
      VENGEANCE ON YOU!</p></center>
<p>She bonks him over the head with the spell book. Giles has reached his 
      limit. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>You know, it's no wonder I'm leaving you!</center>
<p>Anya freezes. The Unseen Creature GROWLS. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>What?</center>
<p>He whips his plane ticket from his pocket and thrusts it in Anya's 
      face. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>A one-way ticket to London and out of<br/>this engagement! 

      <p>ANYA<br/>Of all the nerve!</p></center>
<p>She yanks off her engagement ring and hurls it at him. IT GLANCES OFF 
      HIS SHOULDER AND ROLLS OUT FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA (cont'd)<br/>Now see what you've done? That Thing <br/>is going 
      to eat my ring!</center>
<p>INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT 
      <p>VAMP #3 is right below the hiding place. He hesitates, looking up. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #3<br/>I smell fear.</center>
<p>He starts up the ladder. 
      <p>
<center>VAMP #3 (cont'd)<br/>It smells good.</center>
<p>The vamp climbs farther, then peers into the pipe. 
      <p>VAMP POV: The foursome scrambles out the other side of the pipe. 
      <p>WIDER ANGLE: exterior of pipe. 
      <p>As Tara jumps to the ground, then Willow. Dawn is about to jump, when 
      the vamp, having jumped down, LUNGES FOR TARA. 
      <p>WILLOW THROWS HERSELF ON TARA, pushing her out of the way, landing on 
      top of her. Saving her life. As she does this, THE CRYSTAL FALLS OUT OF 
      HER SHIRT POCKET, but does <u>not</u> break. 
      <p>[Note: this particular part of the sewer features a V-shaped junction. 
      The crystal lands at the point of the "V".] 
      <p>Xander scrambles down the ladder. He is suddenly grabbed by the vampire 
      and thrown into the branch of the "V" away from Willow and Tara! 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Yaaa!</center>
<p>OMITTED 
      <p>OMITTED 
      <p>INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT 
      <p>CLOSE on GILES and ANYA, who are still huddled. Giles reads from a new 
      spell book- 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/><i>Himble voyon abri bara!</i></center>
<p>There is a BRIGHT FLASH OF LIGHT and a BIG POOF OF SMOKE. It clears and 
      we see that everything in the magic shop has been brought back to normal. 
      <p>Anya and Giles stand up from behind the counter. 
      <p>
<center>GILES (cont'd)<br/>Well, that's better.</center>
<p>Anya finds her ring on the floor. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>(sincere) <br/>Oh, thank goodness. </center>
<p>Relieved, she puts it back on. Giles and Anya look at each other, 
      regretful. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>I'm so sorry, Dear. 
      <p>ANYA <br/>No, Rupy- I'm sorry. You were right.<br/>That was the wrong 
      book. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, yes. Yes, it was. But I'm<br/>still sorry.</p></p></center>
<p>She looks up at him, eyes earnest and appealing. 
      <p>
<center>ANYA<br/>Don't leave me. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Oh. Oh, Anya.</p></center>
<p>They move towards each other, about to embrace. 
      <p>INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT 
      <p>Tara and Willow.. Their faces centimeters apart now. 
      <p>IN THE OTHER BRANCH OF THE TUNNEL, Xander fights the remaining vampire. 

      <p>DAWN RUNS AROUND THE CORNER (BY THE FALLEN CRYSTAL), CLUTCHING A PIECE 
      OF SCRAP-WOOD just as the vamp SMACKS XANDER HARD, sending him flying. 
      <p>VAMP #3 PUSHES XANDER up against the side of the sewer. 
      <p>
<center>DAWN (O.S.)<br/>Alex!</center>
<p>He looks toward where Dawn is. She HUCKS THE PIECE OF WOOD AT HIM. 
      Xander reaches up and catches it, holds it to his chest, JUST AS VAMP #3 
      LUNGES, IMPALING HIMSELF on the stake and TURNING TO DUST (<u>ON 
      CAMERA</u>). 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Wow.</center>
<p>BACK IN THE OTHER BRANCH, WE'RE ON TARA AND WILLOW as they move to each 
      other, about to kiss, their first kiss in this world... 
      <p>XANDER backs away from his first dusting, toward Dawn. WE'RE ON THE 
      CRYSTAL, as XANDER STEPS ON IT. SHATTERING IT. IT TURNS FROM BLACK TO 
      WHITE AND THE SPELL IS BROKEN. 
      <p>Their moment shattered, TARA and WILLOW look toward the junction of the 
      tunnel, where Xander and Dawn stand looking down at the broken crystal. 
      Shocked, Tara looks back at Willow, reading the guilt on her face. 
      <p>INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT - SAME TIME 
      <p>Giles and Anya are mid-kiss, her body bent back in a passionate dip. 
      <p>Suddenly, THEY FREEZE, their EYES BUG OPEN! Remembering in an instant 
      who they are and what they are doing. 
      <p>EXT. SUNNYDALE STREETS - NIGHT - SAME TIME 
      <p>Buffy and Spike are fighting TWO REMAINING VAMPIRES. 
      <p>Buffy's really enjoying herself here. Getting a kick out of slaying for 
      the first time in a long time. She's got one of them on the ropes... 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Don't mess with Joan the Vampire -</center>
<p>... AND THEN SHE STOPS. 
      <p>Remembering everything: who she is; her mother's death; heaven; hell on 
      earth... 
      <p>She's frozen. 
      <p>One of the still standing, Vamp #1, KICKS HER IN THE FACE, sending her 
      sprawling back onto the pavement.

      <p>Buffy lies in the middle of the street. She tries to sit up but 
      memories overwhelm her, making her dizzy and sick. 
      <p>Vamp #1 is on her now, KICKING HER while she's down. 
      <p>ANGLE ON SPIKE, up on the sidewalk, fighting the other vampire. 
      Suddenly, Spike remembers. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>Buffy...<br/>(looking toward her)<br/>Buff--</center>
<p>He ABSORBS A BLOW TO THE HEAD, and then KEEPS FIGHTING. TAKING ON VAMP 
      #1, as well. 
      <p>INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT 
      <p>Tara pushes Willow off her, revolted. Willow opens her mouth but has 
      nothing to say. She feels her shirt pocket: the crystal isn't there. 
      <p>Xander looks at the crystal beneath his shoe. 
      <p>Dawn looks at Willow. All four stare at each other, slack-jawed, 
      broken. 
      <p>Suddenly, Xander laughs, a weak sound echoing in the cavernous sewers. 
      <p>The others look at him. 
      <p>
<center>XANDER<br/>Sorry. Just got back the memory of<br/>seeing 'King 
      Ralph'.<br/>(off their looks,<br/>sobering) <br/>We should go back.</center>
<p>They nod and, bleakly, make their way back. 
      <p>ON TARA as tears silently spill down her face. 
      <p>INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT 
      <p>Anya and Giles are madly cleaning the shop, ignoring what just 
      transpired between them. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>Well, this place is certainly in need<br/>of a good 
      tidying? 
      <p>ANYA<br/>Oh yes, yes, yes.</p></center>
<p>EXT. SUNNYDALE STREETS - NIGHT 
      <p>Empowered by fury, Spike grabs the two vampires by their scalps and 
      CRUSHES THEIR SKULLS TOGETHER. 
      <p>They crumple to the pavement and HE STAKES THEM. The first is <u>OFF 
      CAMERA</u>. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>From dust...</center>
<p>The second (VAMP #1) is <u>ON CAMERA</u>. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE (cont'd)<br/>To dust.</center>
<p>At least the fight is over. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH (O.S.)<br/>You're an odd duck, Mr. Spike...</center>
<p>Spike whirls; he forgot. 
      <p>ANGLE ON TEETH who sits on the front stoop. He stands and ambles his 
      way towards Spike. Menacing, in that airy way. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH<br/>Fighting your own kind. Palling<br/>around with a Slayer. 
      And, whoa,<br/>that suit! Chutzpah must be your<br/>middle name.</center>
<p>Spike isn't taking anymore of this shite. He walks towards Teeth, 
      slowly, purposefully. Teeth looks around, noting that none of his heavies 
      are left, and for the first time looks a little scared. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH (cont'd)<br/>Uh, hey, look... About our little<br/>debt 
      problem... It's okay. I don't <br/>need the kittens.</center>
<p>Spike grabs him by the collar; Teeth now <u>very</u> scared. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You'll get paid. I'm no welsher.</center>
<p>He releases Teeth, who blinks. Then smiles. 
      <p>
<center>TEETH<br/>Right, sure. You're good for it. I<br/>know that. So, I'll 
      just, uh...<br/>Yeah.</center>
<p>And he backs away and hurries off into the night. Spike moves to Buffy. 
      She remains on the ground, devastated. 
      <p>
<center>SPIKE<br/>You alright?</center>
<p>He offers her a hand up. She ignores it. Stand up on her own. And walks 
      off. Leaving Spike alone. 
      <p><u>SAD MONTAGE</u>
<p>INT. THE BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>ANGLE ON THE STAGE where the singer performs. 
      <p>ANGLE ON BUFFY at the bar. Her eyes hard with anguish. 
      <p>INT. WILLOW AND TARA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Tara packs her belongings into boxes. Her face, swollen with hours of 
      crying, is now stoic. 
      <p>INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 43 
      <p>Giles sits in his cramped seat. Watching the flight attendant as she 
      goes through the motions: how the seat belt works, the oxygen mask, the 
      location of the exits. Giles' eyes are tired and sad. 
      <p>INT. THE BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>Spike walks up to Buffy She glances up at him. As he opens his mouth to 
      say something, she turns away. After a beat, Spike walks away. 
      <p>INT./EXT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - EVENING 
      <p>Tara exits the door, carrying out a final box as Dawn comes up the 
      steps. Tara puts down the box and goes to give Dawn a hug. 
      <p>Dawn can't take it and runs into the house, up to her room, crying. 
      <p>INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
      <p>Willow sits, fully clothed, on the tile floor of the bathroom crying. 
      She stands up and looks in the mirror. 
      <p>INT. THE BRONZE - NIGHT 
      <p>The singer is singing. 
      <p>The camera moves through the crowd.
