<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, looking cautious and wary, moves 
      through a darkened room full of coffins. Very shmuck baity. Something bad 
      is going down here. She stops in front of one… There's something about 
      it…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SNAP!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harsh fluorescent overheads wash the room in 
      sickly yellow light. Buffy starts and we see GILES at the doorway to what 
      we realized is a casket "showroom" in a funeral parlor.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Buffy. There you 
      are…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He enters, followed shortly by DAWN and a 
      FUNERAL DIRECTOR.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Are you 
      alright?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(looking at casket)<br/>Yeah. 
      I…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FUNERAL DIRECTOR<br/>Did you find 
      something?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(nods &amp; points)<br/>That 
      one.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FUNERAL DIRECTOR<br/>That model is 
      beautiful. In fact,<br/>all of the caskets in this room are <br/>top of the 
      line.<br/>(gently)<br/>However, given your budget, it might<br/>not be 
      the-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Before the funeral director even gets the 
      words out of his mouth, Giles raises a hand and stops him, silently 
      indicating that he will take care of it. Buffy doesn't pick up on this 
      exchange, and the funeral director changes his tune-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FUNERAL DIRECTOR<br/>It's a fine choice. 
      It speaks to <br/>your deep feeling for the deceased.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy is about to move off but notices that 
      Dawn is hesitating. Looking uncertainly at the coffin of 
choice.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You don't like 
      it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>It's not that. It's just - what 
      if<br/>mom… What if she'd like something<br/>else better?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Dawn-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I mean, how do we know? For 
      sure?<br/>She's the one who has to be in it forever.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy can't think about it this way. It 
      hurts too much. She ends the discussion. Not unkindly, but on no uncertain 
      terms.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Dawn. Maybe it wasn't such a 
      good idea,<br/>you coming along…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>It's fine. It's 
      just-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm serious. You shouldn't 
      have <br/>to deal with this stuff-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FUNERAL DIRECTOR<br/>If you'd like a few 
      more minutes <br/>to decide-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(quickly)<br/>No. It's fine. 
      It's done.<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>Okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat. Dawn nods. Buffy moves off - 
      retreating into her own space.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles lays a reassuring hand on Dawn's back 
      before heading after Buffy and the funeral director.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Dawn barely registers it. She lingers, 
      looking at the coffins - stung by Buffy's brusqueness. Lost.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Giles sit at one end of the table 
      going over paperwork and reviewing Joyce's funeral arrangements. Buffy 
      looks stressed and exhausted - but she's glad for the work at hand. In 
      fact, everyone - with the exception of Dawn - has retreated into efficient 
      busyness as their predominant coping skill. This includes Xander and 
      Willow, who sit with Dawn the other end of the table, eating a casserole 
      dish. Or, to be more exact, Willow and Xander are eating. Dawn's hovering 
      - too agitated to sit down.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>I checked prices 
      with a few <br/>different florists. The funeral <br/>home is 
      competitive.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Let's just go with them, then. 
      <br/>It's simpler.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>What color 
      flowers?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>White. They're nice.<br/>(to 
      Giles)<br/>What about an announcement? <br/>People are going to be expecting 
      <br/>a wake after the burial if we <br/>don't say something.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>We could put a line in the 
      program. <br/>Expressing your mother's preference <br/>not to have 
      one.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>There's no 
      wake?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Mom didn't like 
      them.<br/>(smiles a little)<br/>She said pot lucks are depressing <br/>enough 
      as it is.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>She said that? 
      When?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Right before she went in for 
      her <br/>operation. We had a talk about <br/>what she wanted. In 
      case…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>She never said anything to 
      me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I'm sure she just didn't want 
      to <br/>upset you, Dawnster.<br/>(then)<br/>Now you better get working on 
      <br/>that dinner. You've barely touched it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I'm not feeling very 
      casserole-y.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>That's a shame. 'Cause you've 
      got <br/>about 9000 of them in the kitchen. <br/>You could open your very 
      own <br/>Casserole Hut.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>Mrs. Kaplan 
      brought some enchiladas <br/>over. Or there's chicken stuff. I saw 
      <br/>chicken stuff.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>That's okay. I'm not really 
      hungry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(helping himself to 
      more)<br/>Shouldn't stop you. Eating can provide <br/>pleasant 
      numbness.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You should eat, 
      Dawn.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Why should I? You're 
      not.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>This isn't 
      about-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She stops as THE PHONE RINGS. Looks to 
      Giles.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm phoned out. Can you? I 
      mean, <br/>unless it's Dad.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Of course.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles gets it. Buffy and Dawn listen 
      attentively.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Hello? Yes… They did. Thank 
      you… <br/>The service is tomorrow at three. Do <br/>you know the Brown 
      Brothers Mortuary?…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles trails off as he moves into the living 
      room. Buffy's agitated now.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I can't believe he hasn't 
      called yet.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Your Dad's still AWOL, 
      huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(nods)<br/>The number he left 
      for us in Spain is <br/>no good. And I've left messages all <br/>over the 
      place.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>We should try his girlfriend's 
      place-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't have that number. I 
      told you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>But we could ask one of his 
      friends at <br/>work or something.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's getting irritated, but tries hard to 
      maintain.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Dawn. I tried that. 
      Okay?<br/>(to Willow and Xander)<br/>What do you think? Just a line that 
      <br/>says "following the burial, there will <br/>be no wake-" or gathering? 
      "there <br/>will be no gathering at the request of <br/>Joyce?" That's 
      lame.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow starts to clear some dishes, coming 
      in and out of the kitchen.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>What are we going to do - 
      after?<br/>I mean, we're not just coming back <br/>here are 
      we?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I guess. I don't know. How 
      about "At <br/>the request of the family, there will be <br/>no wake 
      following the burial?"</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Good. It's got 
      flow.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I don't want to come back 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn's last comment goes unnoticed as Willow 
      returns from the kitchen and Xander moves to Buffy, who's looking at the 
      program lay out.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Where do I put it? On top, 
      here? <br/>Or on the bottom?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(to Willow)<br/>Maybe I could go 
      to your place tomorrow?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Tomorrow?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Yeah. After everything? I don't 
      want<br/>to come back to the house and stuff.<br/>I don't want to be 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But maybe you and Buffy 
      should… It's <br/>sort of a question for your sister. It's <br/>fine with 
      me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Can 
      I?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Xander are engrossed in the 
      program lay out.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Humm?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Can I go to Willow's 
      tomorrow<br/>after the service?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's a little thrown by the 
      question.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>If you want. I guess 
      so…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn doesn't wait for her to change her 
      mind. Eager for something to do, she starts out of the room.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I'll get my sleeping bag out of 
      the attic.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But she stops in the foyer when she sees a 
      bunch of mail on the floor near the mail slot. She picks it up. Reads it, 
      stricken. Willow notices.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Dawn?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn turns to them, her expression 
      tight.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>It's for mom.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy moves to her, as does Giles - who 
      comes from the living room, off the phone now. A pained beat in which all 
      the activity and avoidance is halted. It's a gut punch, for Dawn most of 
      all. But Buffy just regroups - forges ahead.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(to Giles)<br/>Do we call the 
      post office about <br/>this? Maybe we need to fill out <br/>a form or 
      something.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy moves back to the table with Giles. 
      They continue talking but we stay-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON DAWN</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES(O.C.)<br/>I'll call tomorrow. 
      First thing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY(O.C.)<br/>I haven't even started 
      to think <br/>about the bills and everything…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn just looks at the mail. At her mother's 
      name.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A little bit later. Xander and Willow exit 
      the house, both in fairly grim mode.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You going 
      home?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'm stopping by my mom's 
      first. <br/>Been doing that a lot.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Yeah. I thought maybe 
      I'd<br/>stop by your mom's too.<br/>(off Willow's look)<br/>Well, I'm not 
      going to <u>my</u> house. <br/>Those people are scary-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander stops.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Speaking of.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike's on the path - holding a large bunch 
      of flowers which he was just about to put on the steps. Xander's 
      expression hardens.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You've got to be 
      kidding.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>I'm not going 
      in.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He stoops to deposit the flowers but Xander 
      stops him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>And you're not leaving those. 
      This <br/>isn't the time for your crap, Spike. <br/>You actually think 
      you're going to <br/>score points with Buffy this way?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike stands back up. Livid.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>This isn't about 
      Buffy-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Bull. We're all hip to your 
      doomed <br/>obsession. You're rising to new lows, <br/>man. Or, lowering… 
      towards them.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>They're for 
      Joyce.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Like you care about 
      her.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander's right in his face. This could get 
      ugly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Guys - not 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander doesn't blink - but Spike backs off. 
      He addresses Xander and Willow, indignant but sincere-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(re: flowers)<br/>Care? Joyce 
      was the only one of <br/>the lot of you that I could 
      <u>stand</u>.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>And the only one with a 
      daughter <br/>you wanted to shag. I'm touched.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>I liked the lady. Understand, 
      monkey <br/>boy? She was decent. Didn't put on <br/>airs. Always had a nice 
      cuppa for me… <br/>And she never treated me like a freak.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow looks swayed despite herself by 
      Spike's heartfelt admission. But Xander's not buying it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Her mistake.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">That's it. Spike gives. He drops the flowers 
      at their feet.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Think what you 
      want.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angrily, he moves off. Willow stoops to pick 
      up the flowers.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(fuming)<br/>Unbelievable. Guy 
      thinks he can put on <br/>a big show and con Buffy into being his <br/>sex 
      monkey…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow looks up from the flowers, a little 
      thrown.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>He didn't leave a 
      card.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander examines the flowers. Sees that she's

      we've never seen before. People from Joyce's other life - friends and 
      gallery patrons, etc… Buffy has her arm around Dawn, offering what comfort 
      she can. A minister speaks, but his words are distant…</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn crawls on to her bed. Lays down. Pulls

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh… Dawn. This just sucks,

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(a little angry)<br/>So - what?

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Not forget. No.

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>You make a place in your heart

      that make sense?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Dawn doesn't appear to be listening

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>It was more… intense.<br/>Very

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Yeah. I kinda picked up on

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Well, she got me thinking… 
      About <br/>how people die all the time… And <br/>how they get born too… And 
      how <br/>you kind of need one so you can <br/>have the 
other.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>True. It would get kind of

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>And when I think about it that

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Again I say - 
      huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Well, I just feel like I

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Got it. What makes you feel

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Exactly. Sex is like a big

      <u>making</u> life.</font></center>

      <u>we</u> could. Life could <br/>come out of love and our smooshing <br/>and 
      that's beautiful… It all makes me <br/>feel like we're part of something

<p></p>
<p>

      not the point. The point is,<br/>it's bad. Because…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks to Tara… Because why?</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Because witches can't be 
      allowed to <br/>alter the fabric of life that way, for <br/>selfish reasons. 
      We'd manipulate the <br/>world until it came unglued.<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>You 
      can't understand this now - I <br/>don't expect you to… But as painful 
      <br/>as death is, it's part of nature. Wiccans<br/>took an oath, a long time 
      ago, to honor that-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>So it is possible then. To 
      bring someone <br/>back. They wouldn't have taken an oath <br/>if they

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(firmer)<br/>Maybe "they" could,

      everyday <br/>living resumes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(nods)<br/>Which everybody 
      expects me to know <br/>how to do because I'm so "strong."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>Not right away. I'm sure 
      everybody <br/>understands that you need time.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Time's not the issue. I'm good 
      at <br/>sticking wood in vampires, but Mom <br/>was the strong one in real 
      life. She <br/>always knew how to make things better, <br/>what to 
      say…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>You'll find your way. Not all 
      at once, but…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't 
      know…<br/>(desperate)<br/>I keep thinking about it, Angel. When <br/>I found 
      her. If I'd gotten there ten <br/>minutes earlier-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>You said they told you it 
      wouldn't <br/>have made a difference.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy offers the following like a horrible 
      confession. It's her dirty secret.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No. Probably wouldn't have 
      made <br/>a difference. The exact thing they <br/>said was <u>probably</u>. 
      I haven't told <br/>anyone that-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>That doesn't make it your 
      fault. <br/>You couldn't have done anything <br/>different.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(anguished)<br/>I didn't even 
      start CPR until they <br/>told me to. I fell apart. That's <br/>how good I 
      am at being a grown up.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>Buffy-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>If I just had me to worry 
      about… <br/>But Dawn…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angel pulls her closer.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>It's okay. It's okay. You 
      don't feel <br/>like it now, but you <u>are</u> strong, Buffy. <br/>You're 
      going to figure it out. And <br/>you have people to help you. You <br/>don't 
      have to do it alone.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks at the sky, scared and 
      small.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's going to be light 
      soon.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>I can stay in town. As long as 
      you <br/>want me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>How's forever? Is 
      forever<br/>good for you?<br/>(then)<br/>There's a bad idea. I'm seriously 
      <br/>needy right now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angel strokes some hair from her face. Says 
      tenderly-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>Let me worry about the 
      neediness. <br/>I can handle it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Raw and vulnerable, Buffy looks at him - 
      wanting to believe it. Wanting him closer still. She leans forward and 
      kisses him. He responds gently - meaning to comfort, but the intensity 
      builds quickly, the desire bubbling just under the surface. Buffy would 
      like nothing better to forget herself with him - and he feels it 
      powerfully. They break away from each other, breathing hard.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Told 
      you.<br/>(reluctantly)<br/>You'd better go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>(pained)<br/>I'm 
      sorry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Don't be. I'm so grateful you 
      came, <br/>Angel. I didn't think I was going to <br/>make it through the 
      night.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGEL<br/>We have a few more minutes 
      until<br/>I have to go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy nods, burrows deeper into 
      him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Good.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angel closes his arms even tighter around 
      her. They are both pained and comforted by the powerful bond between 
      them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Good…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And they fall into silence, together until 
      the dawn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ben walks along a deserted outdoor pathway 
      that leads from one wing of the hospital to another. He stops when he sees 
      a cloaked figure lurking near a street lamp.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>(exasperated)<br/>Tell my sister 
      I'm sick of running into <br/>her Jawa rejects.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ben tries to walk by who we now see is 
      JINX.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JINX<br/>But, sir, the Most Delightfully

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>Skip the lips to her 
      backside.<br/>Just say it. Glory.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JINX<br/>Yes, well - she bade me come to 
      you. <br/>The news of your relationship with the 
<br/>slayer-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>We don't have a relationship. 
      I've seen <br/>her around, that's all.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JINX<br/>But you attempted to court 
      her,<br/>did you not?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Reference to this only makes Ben more 
      irritable.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>You're more fun when I hit 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JINX<br/>(cutting to the chase)<br/>It's 
      just, The Lovely And-<br/>(off Ben's look)<br/>Glory would like to encourage 
      this <br/>interest of yours in the slayer. It <br/>might lead to information 
      about the Key.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ben advances on Jinx, 
      intimidating.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>And why would I share that with 
      The <br/>Most Unstable One?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JINX<br/>Time is running short, sir. 
      Every moment <br/>you fight Glory, you're only fighting <br/>yourself, you 
      see?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>Fine. Let the best me 
      win.<br/>(then)<br/>Let Glory understand this. I'm not helping <br/>her find 
      the Key. I would never do that to <br/>an innocent-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ben stops himself. Oops. He just said too 
      much. Jinx's eyes widen…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JINX<br/>(getting it)<br/>Än innocent?" 
      The Key? That's an… <br/>interesting choice of words.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ben could kill himself for his big mouth. 
      Jinx gets both excited and extremely anxious.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>No. That's not what 
      I-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JINX<br/>I - I understand. I'm sorry to 
      have <br/>bothered you. I'll take my leave-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jinx starts to move off but Ben grabs him, 
      freaking out.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>You understand what? When I said 
      <br/>it's innocent… I didn't mean that the <br/>Key is… It's not a 
      person.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JINX<br/>Of course not, sir. Now if you 
      would-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Ben is in full panic.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>You're going to run and tell 
      her, aren't <br/>you? Do you understand what's going <br/>to happen if she 
      finds the Key? How <br/>many people are going to die? I <br/>won't be 
      responsible-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JINX<br/>Please. I heard 
      nothing-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ben grabs a knife from Jinx' own belt - 
      desperate.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>I <u>can't</u> let that happen. 
      Don't you see?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With that, Ben brutally STABS JINX in the 
      abdomen. Jinx cries out and then collapses in his arms. It's quick and 
      brutal.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>I can't…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ben's eyes dart around desperately. He's 
      still alone on the path. After a terrified beat, Ben drags Jinx' body into 
      some bushes and dumps it. Then he takes off - leaving Jinx for 
      dead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. WILLOW'S ROOM - DAY (DAY 3)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's the next morning. Willow and Tara are 
      quietly getting ready for school. Dawn is still under the covers in her 
      makeshift bed - awake but turned to the wall. Tara and Willow exchange 
      worried glances.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she looks at Dawn again. Desperate to 
      help somehow. After a beat - she moves to Dawn.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hey. We're heading down for 
      <br/>breakfast…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I'm not hungry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>That's okay. It's just, we 
      have <br/>class after that. I don't know if <br/>you want to go home 
      or…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn turns to Willow. Her eyes are swollen 
      and red. She looks like she was up half the night crying. Willow takes 
      this in, pained.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I was going to sleep some more. 
      <br/>Giles said he would pick me up, <br/>whenever.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh. Well…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow considers this for a beat. Then 
      -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay. Sure. Hang out. I have 
      a <br/>break around lunch time, I'll come back.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I might not be 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'll try my luck. A noonish 
      Dawn <br/>break would make my day.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn just looks away. Clearly still hurting 
      and angry. Willow feels the sting. She gets up, starts to gather her 
      stuff.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Take care, 
Dawn.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Again, Dawn doesn't respond. Willow casts 
      one more worried glance back at her before following Tara out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As, unnoticed by Tara and Dawn, she 
      surreptitiously raises a finger and focuses on a book on the shelf, 
      magically making it push out of the stack in front of Dawn. It doesn't 
      fall - but it sticks out pretty far.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RESUME</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara and Willow exit. Dawn's about to lie 
      back down when she spies the book hanging out of the bookshelf. That 
      wasn't like that before… Dawn gets up and grabs the book.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON BOOK</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's title - "History of 
      Witchcraft"</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON DAWN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she opens it and reads the chapter 
      headings.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>"The Golden Age of Levitation… 
      <br/>War of the Warlocks… Resurrection, <br/>A Controversy 
      Born."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat as Dawn takes this in. Then she 
      hungrily turns the pages to the chapter in question.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. MAGIC BOX - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles is behind the counter, going over some 
      ledgers. Dawn is with him, giving things a good once over with a feather 
      duster. We notice that she's looking very carefully at everything she 
      "cleans."</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>You don't have to do that, 
      Dawn. <br/>You're more than welcome to relax…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now we see Anya, who trails after Dawn - 
      just a little threatened at having another person infringing on her 
      territory. But also wanting to be nice to Dawn.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Yes, sit down. We have some 
      very <br/>amusing chicken feet you can play with.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>That's okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Don't you watch television? I - 
      <br/>thought all children despise effort <br/>and enjoy 
      cartoons.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(simply)<br/>I like being 
      useful. Keeps my mind <br/>off things.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles takes this in, happy to provide her 
      with distraction.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Then useful you shall be. I 
      can <br/>always use a hand-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>But you have a hand. A paid 
      hand. <br/>A hand that isn't the hand of illegal <br/>child 
      labor-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(cuts her 
      off)<br/>Anya-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles glances at Dawn - let her be. Anya 
      gets his drift-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>-but of course it's wonderful 
      that you <br/>find doing my job distracting. I am <br/>unthreatened.<br/>(to 
      Dawn)<br/>Proceed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anya busies herself - working hard at being 
      unthreatened.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Yes. Carry on, 
      Dawn.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Is there anything I should 
      know? <br/>Like… off limits stuff? Willow <br/>told me that some of the 
      books <br/>and things are kind of dangerous.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Quite right. But all those 
      items <br/>are labeled and kept off the floor.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles indicates THE BALCONY that looks over 
      store. The one with the library ladder leading up to it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Our most potent texts and 
      potions <br/>are all up there. If somebody asks <br/>for anything in that 
      area - just come <br/>and get me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Okay. Anything 
      else?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>If you like, I'll teach you 
      how to work <br/>the cash register. Then you can ring up 
      sales.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Cool.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anya overhears this - gets alarmed all over 
      again.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Ring sales - with the money? 
      She gets <br/>to fondle the money?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anya would go on - but a customer approaches 
      the desk.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(quickly)<br/>Hello customer! 
      I'll help you - unless <br/>you would like help from a darling little 
      <br/>girl who doesn't know anything.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CUSTOMER<br/>I - excuse 
      me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(to Anya)<br/>It's okay. You can 
      take her.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A tad exasperated, Giles grabs some boxes 
      off the counter.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Yes - go ahead, Anya. Dawn can 
      watch <br/>the counter while I go to the store room.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anya takes the confused customer by the arm, 
      leading her away…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>How may I serve 
      you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CUSTOMER<br/>Well… I'm looking for 
      something nice <br/>for a Seer's Empowerment Ceremony. <br/>Under ten 
      dollars.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>What an exciting request! I 
      have <br/>many suggestions…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Anya and the customer move out of sight. 
      Giles and Dawn share a look. Then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>I'll just be a 
      moment.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>No problem.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles heads into the back. As soon as he's 
      gone, Dawn makes for the OFF-LIMITS BALCONY with her book bag in hand. She 
      checks to see that Anya's not paying attention, which she isn't - because 
      she's much too focused on being the best employee ever…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn stealthily climbs the ladder and 
      scrambles onto the balcony. Once there, Dawn wastes no time. She pulls a 
      folded piece of paper from her pocket. It's a page torn from the history 
      book she found at Tara's and Willow's, and it has the name of a spell book 
      and some items needed for a resurrection potion. Dawn checks her paper and 
      pulls one of Giles' ancient books from a low shelf along with a few small 
      viles of potion ingredients. She quickly stuffs the items into her bookbag 
      and checks to see if the coast is clear. It is.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn gets a rung or two down the ladder - 
      but freezes when Giles emerges from the stock room. She holds her breath 
      as Giles passes below her, unaware that she's above him. Giles crosses to 
      Anya and the customer. As soon as he's far enough away, Dawn heads down 
      the ladder and throws her book bag into a corner-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Dawn-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn looks up guiltily. Caught. Giles stands 
      over her, having crossed back her way.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Uh huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Why don't you come watch this 
      <br/>transaction Anya's doing. Then <br/>I'll let you try 
it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's clear that he has no idea what she was 
      up to. Relieved, Dawn bounds to the register. We stay on her bulging book 
      bag, which sits in the corner, unnoticed…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>You got it.</font></center>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">No reply. Jinx has passed out. Glory turns

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>Oh, no… That's…<br/>(to

<p></p>
<p>

      need. Then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>Either one of you witches? Got 
      <br/>experience with spells of this <br/>magnitude?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They hesitate.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>Didn't think so.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Without warning - Doc PLUCKS A HAIR FROM

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Ow!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Doc holds the hair under a light. Examines

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>Your mother's a good candidate, 
      at <br/>least. Strong DNA. Magic can <br/>scramble things up real good -

      in <br/>any kind of shape.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn nods. Pretending she

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Right.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>Hold on.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Doc shuffles off to a tall stack of 
      newspapers, starts shifting through them, mumbling to herself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike and Dawn glance at each other. Then 
      Dawn sees something, registers alarm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON DOC</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As he moves to another stack of papers and 
      we see what Dawn's seeing - just a hint of REPTILIAN TAIL curling from 
      under his bathrobe. But before we can really make it out, it's gone again 
      - disappearing into his clothes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON DAWN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Creeped out. She looks to Spike, but he's 
      lighting a cigarette - missed it. Dawn shakes it off as - </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Finally finds what he was looking for, a 
      SPELL BOOK lost amidst the junk. He comes back to his desk and sits, 
      gesturing for the others to do the same. Dawn hands him the torn page from 
      Tara's book.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I've already gathered some 
      ingredients, <br/>but the spell I found - there's stuff I <br/>don't 
      understand.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Doc glances at her paper, then thumbs 
      through his book - reading. Rambles absently.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>It's all going to change with 
      cloning… <br/>Everybody'll have a double on ice. <br/>The first you conks 
      out? Loved-ones <br/>just call up your replacement. Then <br/>again, we 
      might not make it that <br/>long, mad cows could get us 
      first-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Doc notices that Dawn could care less about 
      this - she wants to know what's in that book.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>But that's not now. <u>Now</u> - 
      you've <br/>got a Ghora demon standing between <br/>you and success. That's

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Ghora… I've heard of

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>Yeah, they like to stick close 
      to the Hellmouth.<br/>(then)<br/>Egg of the Ghora gives life. It's key 
      <br/>to the spell. No egg, no resurrection. <br/>Simple as 
      that.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Can you buy it? This egg, 
      or…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>If this was like making an 
      omelet, <br/>everyone would try it. No, you have <br/>to steal the egg from 
      the demon's nest. <br/>And the Ghora won't be happy about 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Where do we find this 
      demon?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>Hold on, Rocko. First things 
      first.<br/>(to Dawn)<br/>You'll need an image of your mother. <br/>A photo,

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>No problem.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Doc starts writing something on a small pad 
      of paper.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>Once you get all your 
      ingredients <br/>together, including the egg, mix <br/>them up, put them in 
      the center <br/>of a sacred circle with that picture <br/>of your mother 
      and…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He rips the paper off the pad and hands it 
      to Dawn like a prescription.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>…say this incantation three 
      times. <br/>She's not going to appear - "poof!" <br/>It takes a while. But 
      she'll come to <br/>you. Got it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn's eyes are wide with excitement. This 
      might actually work.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Got it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>Something goes wrong, the only

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I'm not going to change my 
      mind.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Doc takes this in. His tone grows more 
      serious.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>It's a tricky spell, girl. I 
      can't say <br/>for sure that your mother will come <br/>back exactly like 
      she was. Sometimes <br/>things get a little… off.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>But she'll still be my 
      mother.<br/>Won't she?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Doc smiles reassuringly, but his words are 
      less comforting.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>More or less.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn takes this in. It's clear she simply 
      doesn't want to entertain what this might mean.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Good. Good.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Doc stands, and Dawn and Spike 
      follow.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>And the Ghora?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>Right, sorry… Go in the sewer 
      entrance <br/>near Tracy Street. You'll see an opening <br/>on your left. 
      Can't miss it. Just follow<br/>that down-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Doc stops as he notices Dawn reaching into 
      her pocket and counting out some bills.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>No, no. Keep your 
      money.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Oh. Thank you-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn meets Doc's kind eyes as he offers his 
      hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DOC<br/>You just keep in touch. Let me 
      know <br/>how it goes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON DOC</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Dawn takes his hand - Doc's eyes go 
      COMPLETELY BLACK for just a moment, another hint of unnerving 
      evil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON DAWN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she quickly takes her hand back, scared - 
      but Doc looks normal again.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I - I… will.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SEWERS - ENTRANCE TO GHORA'S LAIR - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike, who now carries an axe, and Dawn 
      approach the entrance to the Ghora's lair. It's a rough tunnel that leads 
      deep UNDER the sewers.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>It's here. Just like he 
      said.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>So at least we know the old 
      <br/>coot isn't completely daft.<br/>(then)<br/>Look. You'd better let me 
      <br/>snatch this egg thing on my own.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>No way. I'm 
      going.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>No. You're not. I've got no 
      idea <br/>what's down there. I deliver you <br/>back to your sister in 
      pieces, that'd <br/>be the end of me - wouldn't it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>You need me, Spike. Someone's 
      <br/>got to get the egg while you <br/>distract the Ghora.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>I'll manage.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>How? You said yourself you're 
      not <br/>even sure what you're dealing with. <br/>Now come 
      on.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With that, Dawn starts down the tunnel. A 
      frustrated beat - then Spike follows after her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Well, look at that - bitty 
      Buffy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GHORA'S LAIR - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike and Dawn are in the Ghora's lair, 
      which is basically a cave with a big depression in the middle where the 
      Ghora nests. They both peer at the sleeping creature over a large boulder. 
      The Ghora is a huge reptilian beast - but because it's laying down it's 
      hard to tell too much else about it. They can see it's eggs nestled safely 
      behind it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike and Dawn duck behind the rock - 
      confab.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(scared)<br/>Doesn't look so 
      bad.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Wait 'til it wakes up. That's 
      usually <br/>when the bad starts.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I can't get to the eggs unless 
      it moves. <br/>No way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>I'll make it move. You just be 
      ready.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With that, Spike heads around the rock, 
      brandishing his axe. Dawn watches - waiting for her moment to 
      go.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(to Ghora)<br/>Hey! Ghora! 
      Heads up!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Ghora wakes - rears up. It is indeed 
      snake-like, and for the first time we see that it has THREE HEADS, not 
      one. Spike reacts - nonplussed.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Right then. Heads it 
      is.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Ghora slithers menacingly toward Spike - 
      who recovers from his initial shock and fends off it's three fang-filled 
      heads with his axe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON GHORA'S NEST</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn swiftly grabs one of the eggs and makes 
      off with it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON SPIKE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who bobs and weaves, ducking Ghora heads. He 
      spies Dawn making her way toward the entrance of the lair, egg in hand. 
      Trying to back the creature away so he can join Dawn - Spike HURLS his axe 
      toward the Ghora. It embeds right in the center of the left head. The 
      beast cries out and backs off, at least temporarily. Dawn, near the 
      entrance with egg in hand, calls out-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Spike! Come on!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike runs to join Dawn. As they scramble up 
      an embankment, Dawn slips - and the egg falls from her grasp, tumbling 
      down the embankment and BREAKING. The Ghora sees this and GOES INSANE. 
      Dawn's beside herself. Spike keeps moving toward safety.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Leave it, Dawn. Troika there 
      <br/>knows what we're after-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I can't. Mom-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>It's too dangerous, and I 
      don't have-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Dawn's already sliding down the 
      embankment, heading back for the nest.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>-a weapon.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Dawn races toward the nest, the Ghora 
      roars with fury and prepares to strike at her with it's two remaining 
      heads. But right before the monster connects its hit with a LARGE ROCK. 
      And another. And another.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE, desperate, rains rocks on the 
      Ghora.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN grabs a second egg and runs for 
      safety.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE GHORA CHARGES SPIKE - whipping Spike's 
      legs out from under him with it's tail and sending him sprawling. Dawn 
      sees this from where she now stands, near the entrance to the 
      lair.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Spike!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">One of the Ghora heads catches SPIKE IN THE 
      SIDE - takes a big bite. Spike bellows and YANKS HIS AXE OUT OF THE 
      CREATURE'S LEFT HEAD - THEN PLUNGES IT BACK INTO THE CREATURE'S CHEST. The 
      Ghora falls back in agony. Spike scrambles to his feet and runs for the 
      lair entrance, grasping his side in pain. Dawn helps him to safety, 
      wincing at his wound.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Sorry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(pained)<br/>Did you get 
      it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn shows him the egg.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Don't be sorry 
      then.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And they exit the lair.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FADE TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. JOYCE'S ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn, shaking with anticipation and fear, 
      sits on the floor of Joyce's room on a folded white sheet while she 
      prepares the spell. First she mixes the egg and the other ingredients in a 
      bowl. Then she removes a vial of BLOOD from her coat. She pours the blood 
      on the sheet and spreads it with her fingers, making a circle… Then she 
      places the spell ingredients and a photo of her mother in the center of a 
      circle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Finally, she pulls the piece of paper with 
      the incantation Doc gave her on it. She begins, her voice 
shaky-</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara is working on her homework at Willow's 
      desk - but rather than looking at her book, she's gazing out the window - 
      lost in thought. Willow is laying across her bed with a journal, writing 
      and thinking. Willow taps the journal with her pen, trying to remember 
      something… Then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What did I have for breakfast 
      <br/>this morning? Do you remember?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Hum?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I want to say bagel but I 
      think <br/>that was yesterday. You had <br/>eggs, sunny side up. I remember 
      <br/>because they were wiggling at <br/>me like little 
boobs…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(smiles)<br/>Sassy 
      eggs.<br/>(then)<br/>What are you writing this for?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>My journal.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara leaves her desk and comes and sits next 
      to Willow on the bed.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(re: journal)<br/>That's 
      new.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yeah, I figured, you know… 
      <br/>Life goes by fast. If you don't <br/>write it down, a lot of it just

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(affectionately)<br/>Down to

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Down to every last everything 
      <br/>I do with you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They look at each other lovingly for a beat, 
      then Tara's gaze shifts - noticing something.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Huh.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara gets up - goes to the bookshelf across 
      from them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>What happened to "History of 
      <br/>Witchcraft?"</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow sits up, alarm and guilt 
      rising.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I - it isn't 
      there?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara shakes her head, turns to Willow - 
      concerned.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Dawn must have taken 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What? No, she didn't. She 
      did?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>That book has a whole section 
      <br/>on resurrection spells.<br/>(worried)<br/>This is bad. This is really 
      bad…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Willow looks worried too. And 
      regretful.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>But it's just a history book. 
      It <br/>might answer some of her <br/>questions - but it's not like she 
      <br/>could do any harm with that <br/>stuff. Could she?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>It doesn't have a "how to" 
      guide, <br/>but it refers to specific resurrection <br/>spells and 
      potions.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow stands - fully freaked.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I didn't- I mean, hey! How'd 
      <br/>she know that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I don't know. But she could get 
      <br/>into major trouble with that information. <br/>(looking around)<br/>God. 
      What else did she take-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(too 
      quickly)<br/>Nothing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara gives Willow a look - how would she 
      know? Willow starts to ramble nervously-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I think. I <u>think</u> she 
      took nothing else <br/>but maybe she did and we should look, <br/>because 
      who knows? I don't.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>No. We can't waste time on that 
      now. <br/>Who knows what she's up to…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow takes this in - dread 
      rising.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>We need to call Buffy. 
      Now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - FOYER - 
NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The phone is ringing as Buffy enters. She 
      grabs it just before the last ring-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hello? Hey Tara. Yeah, I just 
      got in-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's cut off as, unheard by us, Tara 
      starts to tell her about the magic book. Buffy's expression turns to one 
      of fear and concern…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. JOYCE'S ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The spell continues as Dawn does the final 
      incantation. Dawn now looks a little altered - like the spell has put her 
      in a mild trance.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>…Bone, flesh, breath - yours, 
      <br/>eternally. Bone, flesh, breath - <br/>I beg of you - return to

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The spell ingredients suddenly ignite. 
      Before Dawn can really react to this, Buffy BURSTS INTO THE

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn stands - too disoriented from the spell

      home.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">This hits Buffy like a slap in the face. 
      Dawn pushes past her and runs for the stairs. Buffy remembers herself and

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - FOYER/LIVING ROOM -

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy shakes Dawn hard at this - and the

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/><u>Dawn</u>. You <u>know</u> 
      this is wrong. <br/>You know you can't let this happen. <br/>Not to 
      Mom.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>But I need her. I don't care if 
      she's… <br/>I'm not like you, Buffy, I don't have 
      <br/>anybody-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(shocked)<br/>What? Of course 
      you do.<br/>You have me-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>I don't! You won't even look at 
      me! <br/>It's so obvious you don't want me <br/>around-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's - that's not 
      true-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>It is! And the way you've been 
      acting! <br/>Mom <u>died</u> and it's like you don't even 
      care!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Buffy is beyond surprised - she's 
      appalled and hurt.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>God - of course I care. Of 
      course I do. <br/>How can you think that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>How can I not? You haven't even 
      cried! <br/>You've just been running around like it's <br/>all been some big 
      chore - cleaning up <br/>after mom's mess-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy loses it. Silences Dawn with a SLAP. 
      Not hard enough to really hurt her, but hard enough to shock and scare the 
      hell out of both of them. Buffy's hand flies to her mouth. Both girls are 
      shaking with emotion now - and as Buffy continues, she starts to unravel… 
      All the careful control comes undone. Her true anguish emerges and tears 
      start to come at last as they continue arguing…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I've been working - I've been 
      busy, <br/>because I have to… be…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>You don't. You're avoiding 
      me-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm <u>not</u>. I have to do 
      these things, <br/>'cause… 'cause when I stop, then <br/>she's really… gone. 
      And I'm trying, <br/>really trying to take care of things… <br/>But I don't 
      even know what I'm doing… <br/>Mom, she always knew-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Nobody's asking you to be 
      Mom.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well, who's going to be if I'm 
      not? <br/>Huh, Dawn? Have you thought <br/>about that? Who's going to make 
      <br/>things better? Who's going to take <br/>care of us?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy weeping openly now, desperately. Dawn 
      watches, helpless and scared as Buffy devolves, becoming smaller and more 
      childlike.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Buffy-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I didn't mean to push you 
      away… <br/>I didn't… I just didn't want you to <br/>see me… I mean… Oh, God… 
      <br/>What are we going to do, Dawny? <br/>I'm so scared-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy stops abruptly. A LOUD SHUFFLING on 
      the porch stops them. The sound of whoever's coming isn't quite right - 
      like the person is limping or dragging something. Both Buffy and Dawn 
      catch their breaths - look toward the living room window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON LIVING ROOM WINDOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where a SILHOUETTE THAT LOOKS DISTINCTLY 
      JOYCE-LIKE slowly shambles across the drawn curtains. Except it doesn't 
      look quite right. Something's off about it. It disappears from the window. 
      A long beat. Then-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THERE IS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Whose expression crumbles - she's a lost 
      little girl.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Mommy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANOTHER KNOCK</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON DAWN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who now looks afraid and uncertain. This 
      doesn't feel right. Everything Buffy said is sinking in. This is someplace 
      they shouldn't go.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Buffy…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANOTHER KNOCK</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Almost involuntarily, Buffy starts for the 
      door -</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Mom!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy LUNGES FOR THE DOOR AS DAWN QUICKLY 
      TAKES JOYCE'S PHOTO FROM THE FLOOR AND RIPS IT APART.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON DOOR</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Buffy flings it open. There's nobody 
      there. Nothing but darkness and harsh wind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A stunned, pained beat as it sinks in, in 
      all it's finality - Joyce is gone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy turns to Dawn, sees the scattered 
      pieces of the photo on the floor… Somewhere beyond the pain she 
      understands that it was the right thing to do. But at the moment, she's 
      mostly still the child - in desperate need of solace.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Dawn-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn moves quickly to Buffy and embraces 
      her… They hold each other tightly…</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>It's okay…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy's cries intensify, and although Dawn 
      means to comfort - her tears come as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We stay on the girls for a long beat as they 
      cling to each other.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BLACK OUT</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">END OF SHOW</font></center>
<p></p>
<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></center></p></body></html>
