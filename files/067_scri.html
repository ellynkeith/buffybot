      AFTERNOON</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY and RILEY, exactly as we left them 
      in "Hush" (Episode 10) -- sitting across from each other, in silence. 
      After a couple more beats:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well, somebody should speak 
      before<br/>one of us graduates.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley rises slowly. He crosses past her, 
      then turns back.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>What are you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy eyes him, a little irked at the 
      question.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Capricorn. On the cusp of 
      Aquarius. You?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Sorry. Came out a little 
      blunter<br/>than I intended. It's just...<br/>(enthused)<br/>You're amazing. 
      Your speed, your strength--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Also passionate, 
      artistic<br/>And inquisitive.<br/>(pointedly)<br/>Who are 
you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(sincere)<br/>You know who I 
      am. The rest...<br/>(uncomfortable)<br/>What I do... I can't tell 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She studies him a beat.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Then, let me. You're part of 
      some<br/>military monster squad that rounds up<br/>demons, vampires -- 
      probably have<br/>official-sounding euphemisms for them<br/>like 
      "Unfriendlies" or "Non-sapiens..."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(offering)<br/>Hostile 
      Sub-Terrestrials.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>There you go. So you 
      deliver<br/>these... "HSTs" to a bunch of lab<br/>coats who perform 
      experiments which,<br/>among other things, turn some into<br/>harmless 
      bunnies. How am I doing so far?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(with some concern)<br/>A 
      little too well.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Meanwhile, by day, you pretend 
      to be<br/>Riley Finn, corn-fed Iowa boy. You<br/>ever even been to lowa, 
      Riley?<br/>(realizing)<br/>God, if that's even your name.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>It is. Born and raised. And 
      hey,<br/>bulletin, I'm not the only one who's<br/>been less than honest 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy relents. He's got a point.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'd have thought a 
      professional<br/>Demon chaser like you would've<br/>figured it out by 
      now.<br/>(obviously)<br/>I'm the Slayer.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley looks at her blankly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Slay-er. Chosen one? She who 
      hangs<br/>out a lot in cemeteries?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He shrugs, apologetically.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You're kidding.<br/>(sighs, 
      then)<br/>In every genera--<br/>(w/o skipping a beat)<br/>You know, I really 
      don't feel like<br/>doing the routine. Ask around. Look<br/>it up: "Slayer 
      comma The."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>And you fight... demons... I 
      mean,<br/>you wailed on them -- and these guys<br/>were in shape. Kind of a 
      weird shape, but --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You did pretty well 
      yourself.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>But I'm a walking bruise 
      today. See<br/>me with my clothes off I look like...<br/>I mean I have 
      bruises... purple.<br/>Don't see a scratch on you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Not looking hard 
      enough.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm looking pretty 
      hard.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A little heat here. They break 
it:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>So, then... What do we... 
      do?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(sobering)<br/>I don't know. 
      I'm still... I really<br/>thought you were a nice, normal 
      guy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I am a nice, normal 
      guy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Maybe by this town's 
      standards, but<br/>I'm not grading on a curve.<br/>(after a beat)<br/>I think 
      we both need a little time to<br/>process... everything. Decide 
      where<br/>this... where we're...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Yeah. I think that's a good 
      idea.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He stands. They look at each other for a 
      moment.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Don't think I need to tell 
      you...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I won't say a word to 
      anybody.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Good. It'll be safer for 
      all--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SKRRREEECH! Amy the rat lets out an agitated 
      SQUEAL. They turn to look at her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>--concerned.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What's--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then, a LOW, RUMBLING HUM and the room 
      begins to violently SHAKE. A few breakables fall off the shelf and 
      SHATTER.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley instinctively grabs Buffy and moves 
      into the door frame until the shaking finally subsides. In the distance, 
      CAR ALARMS BLARE.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(jazzed)<br/>Wow. That was some 
      ride,</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY slowly crosses to the 
      window.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Sorry. I'm a little 
      excited.<br/>It's my first earthquake.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY, staring out the window, her 
      reflection in the glass reveals a sense of dread.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh, good. Hate for my 
      little<br/>"untimely, horrible death"<br/>concern to be 
      ambiguous.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>But until evidence

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(interrupting him)<br/>Okay, 
      say this quake was a sign -- a<br/>bad omen. And we just ignore 
      it.<br/>There's gonna be some pretty red<br/>faces around here if the world 
      comes<br/>to an end.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>If the quake is heralding 
      a<br/>catastrophe such as that, I'm sure<br/>they'll be other signs to 
      follow,<br/>affording us enough time to avert it.<br/>(back to map)<br/>Now, 
      I believe the commandos'<br/>installation is somewhere very close<br/>to, if 
      not directly under, your<br/>school. And as such, I'm convinced<br/>one or 
      more of them may be in your<br/>very midst--</font></center>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(interrupting her)<br/>Buffy,

      notice of the beast.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>And how do you explain the 
      things<br/>we deal with, Forrest?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>(shrugs)<br/>They're just 
      animals, man. Plain and<br/>simple. Granted, a little rarer than<br/>the 
      ones you grew up with on that<br/>little farm in Smallville, 
      but--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RAAAAUGGHHH! They hear the ROAR behind them 
      and turn to see...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THEIR P.O.V. - THE LARGE DEMON has SLAMMED 
      the Guard against the wall, sending him sprawling to the ground. It's in 
      the midst of breaking the chain restraining his wrists, as the Scientist 
      fumbles for a syringe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON RILEY and FORREST, moving into action 
      mode. They dive at the huge creature and wrestle it to the ground. The 
      LARGE DEMON grabs FORREST in a headlock as it SNAPS its jagged- toothed 
      maw at Riley.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>(choking)<br/>Where's... 
      that... hypo...?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley tries to wrench his friend free, as he 
      looks to see</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE SCIENTIST still filling the hypo. Then 
      dropping it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley sighs, grabs the NIGHT STICK next to 
      the prone Guard and WHAMS the LARGE DEMON hard across the jaw, knocking it 
      unconscious.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Never mind.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He helps Forrest to his feet. As the 
      scientist tends to the semi-conscious guard, there is a DISTANT METALLIC 
      BANGING, echoing throughout the hall.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Like I said. Animals.<br/>(re 
      banging)<br/>What's that racket?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>The "animals" are rattling 
      their<br/>cages. Been going on all day.<br/>Wonder what's got them all 
      worked up.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. PORTER DORM LOBBY - AFTERSHOCK PARTY - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A WILD PARTY rages in the BLACKED-OUT common 
      room of the dorm (which oddly enough resembles the redressed Commons of 
      the university). The only illumination comes from numerous scattered 
      CANDLES, EMERGENCY CAMPING GAS-LAMPS and the criss- crossing streams of 
      light from a bunch of handheld FLASHLIGHTS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Much WHOOPING, kissage, cliquish 
      groupings... Many partiers sport colorful phosphorescent necklaces, 
      bracelets and other accessories.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A battery powered boom-box supplies the 
      appropriately WB-style party ambience MUSIC. PANNING across, we find 
      WILLOW, looking and feeling a little alone, apparently as she knows no one 
      else there. A couple of times, she's bumped by partiers in the dimly lit 
      hall, with nary an apology. She glances at her watch, obviously anxious 
      for Buffy's arrival.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">After a moment of looking around, she 
      brightens when she sees</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW'S P.O.V. - PERCY -- her tutee from 
      high school - his arm around his GIRLFRIEND, a pretty coed.</font></p>

      Hi!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He looks at her, smiles pleasantly but a 
      little distantly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PERCY<br/>Hey, Willow. What's goin', 
      on?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh, stuff. Thought you got 
      that<br/>football scholarship to USC.</font></center>
<p></p>

      huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">LAURIE<br/>It's okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The girlfriend just looks at her, 
      expressionless, causing Willow some discomfort until Percy chimes 
      in.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PERCY<br/>So, how's Oz?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh. Oz. Well, um, actually, 
      he's--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Percy holds up his hand as the girlfriend 
      whispers something into his ear. Willow stands there, awkwardly. Then 
      Percy turns to her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PERCY<br/>We're gonna get some 
      drinks.<br/>Cool to see you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Percy's gal pal pulls him away. Willow calls 
      after them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yeah, catch 
      you...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They're gone. Willow sighs, scans the room 
      again, checks her watch.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Buffy'll get here 
      soon.<br/>Then the fun'll start.</font></center>

      stairwell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON the door as it slowly swings 
      closed, with a mild rusty CREAK. Right before it does</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A SHIRTLESS PARTIER is at a makeshift BAR

      make out the occasional party atmosphere in the hall.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE PARTIER grooves to the music as he mixes 
      concoctions for his pals. He calls over his shoulder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A hellish DEMON unlike any hellish demon 
      we've seen before. (Honestly.) It's scaly hide GLISTENS with an oily

      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The LIGHTS are STILL OUT. MUSIC still plays. 
      More guests are pairing up now, some making out in the dark corners of the 
      room. GRAHAM is visible in the b.g., chatting up a girl.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON WILLOW, alone, trying out a few funky 
      solo dance moves, getting self-conscious, and finally stopping.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks at her watch again and crosses to 
      a window to peer out, looking for...</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(to herself)<br/>Buffy. Where 
      are you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Unbeknownst to Willow, she's ended up next 
      to Percy - his back to her as he leans over his girlfriend. In the 
      near-dark, Willow (and the audience) probably doesn't even recognize him 
      until she hears:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">LAURIE<br/>Why, so I can watch 
      you<br/>flirting with that red head?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PERCY<br/>Rosenberg? Yeah, right. She 
      was<br/>just some egghead who tutored me a<br/>little in high school. She's 
      nice,<br/>but, please... captain of the nerd squad.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">LAURIE<br/>Well, I don't know. Maybe you

      me<br/>old fashioned...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow is devastated. As Percy leans in to 
      kiss his girl, Willow moves away, pushing between huddled couples. Near 
      tears, she heads away from the party, down the DARK (still in blackout) 
      residential hallway. She opens a door into:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. PORTER DORM ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">This is the partier's room from Act One, but 
      you might not know that because the candles are blown out and it's pitch 
      black in here, only the faint outlines of the windows visible.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hello? Anyone in 
      here?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow enters and closes the door. She is 
      only the vaguest shape moving into the room, if that. We hear her sigh, 
      hear the creak or the bed as she sits, then lies down on it. She sniffles 
      in the dark.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE LIGHTS COME ON with a snap. From the 
      party, we can HEAR THE DISAPPOINTED "AWW."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">In a CLOSE SHOT: Willow, lying on the bed, 
      eves open. She slowly looks to one side, into the MILKY EYES of</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A DEAD BODY - The shirtless Partier. Now 
      very pale, his throat and each of his limbs slashed. A leg and arm hang 
      over the edge of the bed and there appears to be a couple of pillows 
      propped underneath his torso.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Wigged, Willow springs to her feet and 
      stumbles backward. As she does, she takes notice of something.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW'S P.O.V. - A mysterious eye-like 
      SYMBOL has been cut into the boy's torso.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow panics, scrambles for the 
      door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. XANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT (PREVIOUSLY 
      SCENE B)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander enters from the door at the top of 
      the stairs, wearing his uniform and cap, and finishing a slice of pizza. 
      There's a jaunt in his step, a tune in his heart, the picture of 
      unsuspecting innocence.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Mmm. Too bad you don't eat, 
      Spike.<br/>Dropped a sausage and mushroom, and<br/>the guy wouldn't take 
      it--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He reaches the bottom of the stairs and 
      freezes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER'S P.O.V. - the room is in huge 
      disarray -- all the damage from earlier, and then some. A mangled ironing 
      board stands in the middle of the room. Clothing lies scattered around, 
      some of it wet. Suds cling to the side of the washer. Detergent is spilled 
      an the floor. The dripping pipe is still evident and the bucket is now 
      full and overflowing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON XANDER, stunned.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Spike! Place is worse than 
      when<br/>left. Didn't even fix the drip.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then, from behind, he hears an urgent and 
      ominous voice:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (O.S.)<br/>Don't turn 
      around.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Spike? What is it? What's 
      happened?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE (O.S.)<br/>Don't look at me. 
      It's...<br/>It's horrible.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander turns and sees Spike (we don't yet). 
      He blanches and his expression turns to one of extreme revulsion. It's 
      bad.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(horrified)<br/>Oh my 
      god.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now we see him. He's barefoot, wearing 
      cutoffs and one of Xander's Hawaiian shirts.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>I shrunk them. My 
      bleeding<br/>shirt, trousers...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike holds up his regular shirt, now 
      teeny-weeny. Xander can barely contain himself. He bursts out 
      laughing.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Look at you. You have 
      knees!<br/>Very white knees!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike sits on the sofa, dejected. The 
      cutoffs ride up. He stands back up, tugs them into place.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Damn things keep doing 
      that.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You know I'm not any happier 
      about<br/>you wearing my stuff than you are.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>That cannot be true. Don't 
      know how<br/>you let yourself be seen in 
      this...<br/>wanker-wear.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Hey. I'm known as<br/>a very 
      sharp dresser.</font></center>
<p></p>

      some decent stuff.<br/>And I want more blood.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>No. You're not a guest. 
      You're a<br/>vampire and you have no soul and<br/>don't get exactly why 
      we're not<br/>making you into Spike-on-a-stick.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Wish you would, if it's gonna 
      be like this.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike slams his hand down on the ironing 
      board, breaking it further.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>That's my 
      mom's!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>How you gonna stop me, you 
      stupid<br/>sod? Property damage I can do.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>That's it! I am way past 
      through<br/>with you. Hate to break it to you,<br/>Oh, Impotent One, but 
      you're not the<br/>"Big Bad" anymore. You're not even<br/>the "Kinda 
      Naughty." You're nothing<br/>but a waste of space. My space. And<br/>as much 
      as I always got a big laugh<br/>watching Buffy kick your shiny, 
      white<br/>bum, and as much as I know I could<br/>give you a little 
      bum-kicking myself<br/>now, I'm here to tell you...<br/>(gets in Spike's 
      face)<br/>You're not even worth it.<br/>(heads up the stairs)<br/>I'm outta 
      here. Anybody looking for<br/>me, I'll be at Anya's.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike calls after him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(mocking)<br/>Fine. Run off to 
      your girlfriend,<br/>then. "Oooooh. Spike's so mean to<br/>me -- boo hoo 
      hoo..."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER (O.S.)<br/>(called down)<br/>At

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We hear the door SLAM, and with that, the 
      drippy pipe above and behind Spike COMES APART and drenches him in rusty 
      water. He disbelievingly takes in his soaking form for a moment, then lets 
      out a ROAR filled with despair and outrage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Finally, the demon gets her in a body hold, 
      and squeezes, crushing her. Her arms pinned by the demon, she struggles to 
      break free. She head butts the demon, dazing herself a little in the 
      process. The demon ROARS again and drives her down to the ground, where 
      she hits hard. It moves off, carrying the bag of bones.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Moves between us and Buffy -- partially 
      blocking our view of her. A heavy foot crunches on gravel. Buffy hears it, 
      and stiffens, tensing for a renewal of the fight. From a seemingly 
      defenseless position on the around, she suddenly FLIPS herself up to her 
      feet, braced for the fight - her hand shooting out in a vicious punch at 
      the same time...</font></p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>We'll be going out in civvies 
      -- day<br/>clothes only, guys. Weapons stowed<br/>in packs, keep 'em out of

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'll check the majik shop. See 
      if<br/>they've heard of a book called the<br/>"Word of Valios." Willow, 
      Xander,<br/>how 'bout the book archives at the museum?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>We'll go by my place on the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Willow and Xander turn for the

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Will, Xander - this thing

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. XANDER'S BASEMENT - EVENING (PREVIOUSLY

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON XANDER'S COFFEE TABLE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where we see that a STAKE has been secured 
      to the edge with a C-Clamp.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WIDEN TO INCLUDE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike, at his nadir. Perched on the edge of 
      the couch above the coffee table, arms outstretched, ready to impale 
      himself on the stake. He takes a moment to firm his resolve. Closes his 
      eyes.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Goodbye Dru. See you in 
      hell.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's just stepping off the couch when Willow 
      and Xander enter from the stairs, distracting him. As a result he misses 
      the stake completely and crashes down on the coffee table, destroying 
      it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Bloody rot! Can't a person 
      knock?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow and Xander rush to him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>What are you 
      doing!?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander takes in the stake, the clamp - gets 
      it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You were trying to stake 
      yourself!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike, humiliated and defeated, replies with 
      pure belligerence, of course.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Fag off. It's no concern of 
      yours.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Is too. For one thing - 
      that's my<br/>shirt you're about to dust. And for<br/>another - we've shared 
      a lot here.<br/>You should have trusted me enough to<br/>do it for 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Xander-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>What? He wants to die. I want 
      to help.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow snatches the stake from 
      him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Well - I don't know - it's 
      ooky. We<br/>know him. We can't just let him poof! himself.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(desperate)<br/>But you can. 
      You know I'd drain you<br/>drier than the Sahara if I had half<br/>a chance. 
      Besides, I'm beyond<br/>pathetic. Stuck in this basement,<br/>washing 
      skivvies for a blighter I<br/>wouldn't have bothered to bite a few months 
      ago-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Hey-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>I mean - am I even remotely 
      scary<br/>anymore? Tell me the truth.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He makes a menacing motion toward Willow - 
      which looks pretty lame in his Hawaiian shirt and cutoffs.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(trying)<br/>Well, the shirt 
      is, kinda. And-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Please. Leave a bloke a shred, 
      will you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike implores her with his eyes. Please 
      kill me. A beat as Willow considers. Then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'm sorry. it's just not 
      right. And<br/>besides - you still haven't told<br/>Buffy everything about 
      the commandos.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander, exasperated, changes his shirt as he 
      starts to gather some weapons he has hidden around the room.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(to Spike)<br/>Fine. But you 
      break anything else<br/>while we're gone and you'll be<br/>sleeping in the 
      garage, Buster.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>We can't just leave him like 
      this.<br/>We'll have to take him with us to the museum.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike tries for true sincerity as he offers 
      the following.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>You go on. I won't do 
      anything. I<br/>feel better now. Promise.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander and Willow regard him for a moment. 
      Then each take Spike by an arm - drag him toward the door.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(to Spike)<br/>Look at the 
      happy. If we don't find<br/>what we're looking for - we're facing<br/>an 
      apocalypse.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(heartened)<br/>Really? You're 
      not just saying that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And they exit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET - EVENING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy is on her way to the majik shop to 
      look for the Book of Valios, when she sees Riley moving toward her - 
      discreetly reading some kind of electronic instrument he holds in his 
      hand. Buffy hesitates, considers changing directions - but Riley looks up, 
      sees her.</font></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>What? Oh-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley checks to make sure they are not being 
      overheard. Then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>It takes trace readings of 
      the<br/>creature's pheromones.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>It's either mating season for 
      this<br/>thing - or it's moving all over town.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He stops as Forrest and Graham catch up from 
      further down the street. While they are both in civvies, they are 
      definitely on duty, and their militaristic demeanor shines through. They 
      both nod a greeting to Buffy. Then Forrest moves to Riley.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Can I have a minute, 
      man?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Actually, I should get going 
      anyway-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No. Hold up.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy is surprised by his firmness. Nods. He 
      and Forrest move a short distance away.</font></p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>We have some giant ass

      want to check your priorities.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(laughs lightly, fondly 
      remembering)<br/>Hey, remember that time I asked you<br/>your opinion? Gee, 
      neither do I...<br/>(then)<br/>You and Graham move ahead. I'll<br/>catch up 
      with you in a few minutes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest, put off - shakes his 
      head.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>I don't know about this 
      girl, man.<br/>She's got you whupped something<br/>fierce, and you haven't 
      even-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(cutting him 
      off/hard)<br/>You'd be wise not to finish that<br/>thought, private. Now 
      carry on.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Forrest stops himself. Returns to military 
      form, albeit somewhat bitterly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FORREST<br/>Carrying on.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He moves back to Graham and the two of them 
      continue patrolling. Riley returns to Buffy. They're both majorly 
      uncomfortable.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Sorry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's okay. But, really, I'd 
      better<br/>keep moving. You know - big bad<br/>needing to be 
      squished-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Right. I'm on it 
      too.<br/>(then/frustrated)<br/>It's just - this thing. This you and<br/>me 
      thing? It's stupid.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy isn't quite sure how to take this. 
      Replies a little warily.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Right. Which is why we 
      can't.<br/>Do the you and me thing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No. I mean you're stupid. I 
      mean,<br/>I don't mean that... no, I think maybe I do.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Wow. Sweet talk like that will 
      melt<br/>my reservations.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm serious. You've got this 
      twisted<br/>way of looking at things. This -<br/>this doom and gloom 
      mentality. You<br/>keep thinking like that, things are<br/>probably going to 
      turn out just the<br/>way you expect.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You know, there is nothing 
      more<br/>dangerous than a psych grad student.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Pissed, she starts to brush past him. But he 
      stops her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Buffy -- where's the bad here? 
      It<br/>just turns out we're even more well<br/>matched than we thought we 
      were. I<br/>mean, you're a-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Some people pass. Riley catches

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>-fry cook. And so am 
      I.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Right. But you're an 
      amateur... fry<br/>cook and I come from a long line of<br/>fry cooks who 
      don't live past twenty-five.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Which is exactly the attitude 
      I'm<br/>talking about! I know the risks of<br/>what we do. I also know it's 
      more<br/>rewarding than any other job on the<br/>planet. And 
      fun-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Fun? Right. The last person I 
      knew<br/>who believed that is in a coma right<br/>now because she had so 
      much "fun" on the job.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm not saying you shouldn't 
      take<br/>your work seriously-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But just turn my frown upside 
      down,<br/>is that it? I wish I could - but<br/>this isn't the kind of gig 
      where you<br/>hang it up at the end of the day and<br/>snuggle with your 
      honey.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>But why? Why can't it 
      be?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I've tried it, okay? And every 
      time,<br/>things fall apart - and I get sucked<br/>right back into the uber 
      evil.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(cutting her off)<br/>Welcome 
      to the story of the world!<br/>Things fall apart, Buffy. Evil - it<br/>comes 
      and goes. But the way people<br/>manage is, they don't do it alone.<br/>They 
      pull each other through. And,<br/>sometimes, they even enjoy<br/>themselves. 
      If you weren't so self<br/>involved, you'd see that!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(hurt)<br/>You don't know what 
      you're talking<br/>about. You barely know me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Again, Buffy's had enough. She starts to 
      walk. But Riley keeps pace with her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I know that it's not just the 
      job<br/>thing. I'm sure there's some good<br/>looking guy that done you 
      wrong in<br/>there too but mostly I think you want<br/>to stay down in the 
      dark place.<br/>'Cause maybe it's safer down there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You are so out of 
      line-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No - see - I don't think so. 
      We have<br/>an opportunity here, you and me. And<br/>the fact that you're 
      too scared to<br/>even give it a try-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy turns on him - really hurt and angered 
      now.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It is my business. So why 
      don't you<br/>just leave me alone?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat as Riley takes this in. He's still 
      worked up - but he's said his piece.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Fair enough.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Another beat as they stare each other down. 
      Then Riley turns and walks off to join his men - leaving Buffy seriously 
      rattled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. MUSEUM - EVENING</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With that, Buffy whips a stake out of her 
      jacket and FLINGS IT at DEMON #3, knocking the TALISMAN out of his hand. 
      The demons react to this, looking at Buffy - startled and 
      distracted.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And you can't raise hell if 
      you can't<br/>do the spell, right guys?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat as the demons process this turn of 
      events - then CHARGE BUFFY. She and the monsters trade blows, while Xander

      frustrated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then Demon #1 ends the game by hitting 
      Xander over and over, trying to weaken him. Xander holds the chalice tight 
      as he tries to fend Demon #1 off.</font></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>You picked the wrong guy,

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A disinterested Spike catches the bag more 
      out of instinct than anything else. Sees Demon #2, now more furious than 
      ever - charging toward him.</font></p>

Perfect.</font></center>

      giving her a run for her money.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON XANDER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Demon #1 finally wrests the chalice of 
      blood away from him, Xander readies himself for further attack - but the 
      demon seems to have no more interest in him. Instead, Demon #1 FLINGS 
      HIMSELF AND THE CHALICE into the Hellmouth. Xander, stunned, takes this 
      in.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(baffled)<br/>Okay. Guess I 
      won.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now the ground starts to shake, a tremor of 
      the decidedly portentous variety starting to build. Xander processes this. 
      A beat. Then the light goes on. He yells to Buffy-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>The demons! They are the 
      sacrifice!</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON SPIKE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who misses this news because he's in the 
      midst of getting pummeled by Demon #2. Spike looks like he's reached the 
      end of his rope. Tired, broken... But then something in him snaps. If he's 
      going to go out, he'll go out fighting. No matter how much it 
      hurts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He YELLS and STRIKES BACK at his assailant, 
      who staggers back from the punch. A beat as Spike cringes, then realizes 
      that hitting the demon didn't hurt him in the head at all.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>No pain...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Demon, just recovered from Spike's last 
      blow, lurches toward him. SPIKE POUNDS him again. And, again, no pain. 
      Camera pushes in on:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>I can hurt a 
      demon...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With this new awareness, SPIKE GOES TO TOWN 
      ON THE DEMON, UNLEASHING A DIZZYING TORRENT OF PENT-UP VIOLENCE ON THE 
      UNLUCKY FELLOW and going VAMP FACE in the process. His display is truly 
      impressive, kicking and hitting until the demon is crumpled in a dying 
      heap on the ground.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Yeah! That's right! I'm back 
      and<br/>I'm a bloody animal! Yeah!!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He raises Demon #2 over his head with a 
      victory howl and hurls it into the Hellmouth, along with the bag of bones. 
      The others SHOUT in protest, but it's too late.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The GROUND STARTS TO TREMBLE even more 
      violently. Walls start to crumble. Spike takes in Willow and Xander's 
      appalled stares.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(innocent)<br/>What? I was 
      helping.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who notes the ever destabilizing structure

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Get out of here. The 
      building's<br/>going to come down!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A piece of debris falls on Spike, dazing 
      him. The others pull him out of the library.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy continues to struggle with Demon #3. 
      Emboldened by the near completion of the spell, the demon is stronger than 
      ever - beating her closer and closer to the Hellmouth. She finds her stake 
      on the floor and sinks it into the demon's chest. It SCREAMS and raises 
      its arms for a killing blow. Then, suddenly, the demon is yanked off her 
      by unseen hands. Buffy, confused, looks up to see RILEY, IN FULL COMMANDO 
      GARB, wrestling the demon off her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley and the demon go hand to hand. Riley 
      fights well - but it's clear that he's outmatched by the creature. After a 
      moment, Buffy recovers enough to join in again, yells to Riley-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Don't let him jump in the 
      Hellmouth!<br/>If he does, we're finished!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley nods his understanding and hits the 
      demon hard, sending him staggering away from the lip of the Hellmouth. 
      Just as it seems the two of them may best the demon, AN OVERHEAD BEAM, 
      LOOSE FROM THE TREMORS, FALLS. The beam separates Buffy and Riley from the 
      monster, and clips Riley on the leg, hurting him (but not pinning 
      him.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON DEMON</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's badly injured, near death - but using

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON BUFFY AND RILEY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Seeing this, Buffy starts to crawl over the

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm going in.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat. Then Riley makes a decision. He 
      grabs her belt and affixes a RETRACTING CABLE HE WEARS ON HIS UTILITY BELT 
      TO IT WITH A GRAPPLER'S HOOK.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They share a quick but powerful look of 
      connection.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You're coming back 
      out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE DEMON AND BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The demon is a few feet ahead of her as he 
      reaches the edge of the Hellmouth and hurtles himself in. Without 
      hesitation, Buffy does the same, diving in head first.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. HELLMOUTH - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The inside of the Hellmouth is basically a 
      dark tunnel in the earth. We see the DEMON FALLING THROUGH FRAME - and 
      BUFFY HOT ON ITS HEELS, DIVING IN AFTER IT. She, too, disappears through 
      frame toward an unknown fate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SCHOOL RUINS/LIBRARY AREA - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley anxiously watches the entrance to the 
      Hellmouth, when the cable snaps tight in his hands. With tremendous 
      effort, he starts pulling it up as fast as he can, unsure of what he'll 
      find on the other end.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON HELLMOUTH</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As we see BUFFY EMERGE, struggling mightily 
      to work her way out of the tunnel while she keeps hold of the demon. Riley 
      rushes to help her, pulling the dying demon all the way out and lying it 
      on the ground. Buffy crawls out, spent from the effort of her 
      leap.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Buffy. Are

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Before he has a chance to finish, the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH RUINS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We see Xander, Willow and Spike standing 
      away from the school. Then Buffy and a slightly limping Riley emerge from 
      the wreckage. While Will, Xander and even Spike are obviously happy that 
      the world isn't ending - they are more than a little surprised to see 
      Riley in action. Riley, in turn, is shocked to see them there. He 
      immediately tries to cover, launching into an unconvincing, blustering 
      explanation.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Well, hey! Willow. Xander, 
      right?<br/>What are the chances, huh? I was<br/>just passing by - and I

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley tries the laughing it off method now.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And they all start to move off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON XANDER AND WILLOW</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Who both look as though they feel strangely 
      liberated.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Good world saving back there, 
      Will.<br/>The keep away thing was key.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Will takes this in, gratified.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You too. If you hadn't 
      figured out<br/>that "demons are the sacrifice"<br/>thing - we'd all be hell 
      babies by now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now they boast somewhat 
mockingly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>What can I say? We kicked 
      the<br/>apocalypse's ass.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Again.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat, then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Weird being back, wasn't 
      it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Yeah. Everything looked so 
      much<br/>smaller. And more charred and ruin-y.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE WHOLE GANG</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Riley really takes in Willow, Xander and 
      Spike in their torn and dirtied clothes.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>So - what are you guys<br/>all 
      doing here, anyway?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As they walk away Willow, Xander and Buffy 
      share a look. Then Buffy replies - a simple throwaway as they leave behind 
      the black remains of Sunnydale High.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>We used to go 
      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LOWELL HOUSE - RILEY'S ROOM - 
      DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The next day. Riley's room is fairly typical 
      college guy fare, except we might notice a few more pictures of family, 
      the respectful lack of girly pin ups... Riley sits on the edge of his bed 
      again - clearly distracted as he shoots total air balls at the Nerf 
      basket. A quiet knock on the door interrupts him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Come in.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Buffy pokes her nose in - enters. She 
      seems somehow calmer. More resolved.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hey. You never called,<br/>I 
      didn't know if you...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley anxiously cuts her off. It's clear 
      that he's worked himself into a terrible state of agitation.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Oh, hey, sorry, I'm just. I'm 
      a dead<br/>man. Secret. Highly. Or, it's<br/>supposed to be. Then you find 
      out,<br/>I can deal. You're special. But<br/>last night with your friends 
      was a<br/>disaster. I mean, could I have been<br/>less convincing? I was 
      trained to be<br/>sneaky and stuff and I'm like - hi,<br/>paint ball, just 
      passing by... I<br/>should have just given them my<br/>security code and 
      rank-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You have a security code and 
      rank?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley looks like he wants to kill 
      himself.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No. Did I say - ? I... Oh, 
      God...<br/>This is so not good. Everybody knows<br/>about me. I'm finished. 
      It's the<br/>end of the world.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(calmly)<br/>No. It's 
      not.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And she kisses him. A kiss that takes Riley 
      by surprise at first, but which he quickly gives himself over to. It grows 
      into quite a passionate embrace...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. GILES' APARTMENT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles, still bandaged and bruised from the 
      beating he took, nurses a cup tea while he sits with Willow and Xander, 
      trying to watch something on the television. The only problem is - Spike's 
      in the way.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>What's this? Just sitting 
      about<br/>watching the telly when there's evil<br/>afoot? Not very 
      Industrious of you.<br/>I say we get out there and kick a<br/>little demon 
      ass!<br/>(off their silence)<br/>Can't go without your Buffy, is that<br/>it? 
      Too chicken? Let's find her,<br/>then. She is the chosen one after 
      all.<br/>(more frustrated)<br/>Come on! Vampires, grrrrrrr - nasty!<br/>Let's 
      annihilate em! For justice!<br/>And... and for the safety of<br/>puppies... 
      and Christmas, right?<br/>Let's fight that evil! Let's kill<br/>something! 
      Oh, come on...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow, Xander, Giles just eye him, wearily 
      and warily.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BLACK OUT.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">END OF SHOW</font></center>
<p></p>
