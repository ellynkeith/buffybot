<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (NIGHT ONE)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The silent moonlit graveyard. All seems as 
      it should: the dead underground and the living elsewhere. But there, atop 
      a crypt, the shadow of a creature; SOMETHING LIES IN WAIT.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Moonlight illuminates the creature. It's 
      Buffy, perched like a jungle cat waiting for her prey. She cocks her head, 
      sensing something. She stands, her large, rough-hewn stake in hand, and 
      then LEAPS from the crypt, hitting the ground and rolling deftly to her 
      feet. Her instincts lead her forward, stalking, then running; on the 
      hunt.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then Buffy stops abruptly. She's in a new 
      area of the graveyard. There are some empty graves waiting for coffins and 
      some recently filled. Sensing something, she raises her stake and thrusts 
      it toward a fresh plot... AT NOTHING.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But just before her stake hits earth, two 
      vampire arms break through. POOF! Her stake penetrates his chest and he is 
      dusted before he could emerge...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy pivots, just as a nearby grave bursts 
      open and a recently dead vamp begins to crawl his way out. The vampire is 
      animalistic; extra-muscley and vicious. He SNARLS and ATTACKS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy deflects his attack with a series of 
      well-placed kicks, driving the vamp back towards a nearby tomb. She pulls 
      back her stake, preparing to dust... when SOMEBODY DASHES OUT from behind 
      the tomb, and tackles the vampire out of frame.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The vamp buckles and the renegade hunter is 
      revealed...</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley is surprised (and pleased) to see her, 
      too.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Buffy! What are you doing 
      here?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>My job...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Behind Riley, the vampire rises 
      again...</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I just thought you were in the 
      north<br/>sector -</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Watch out!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">...and in a flash Riley's on him. He grabs 
      the vamp, LIFTS HIM clear off the ground and HURLS him against the nearby 
      tomb.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Never mind.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The vamp crumples, woozy. Riley's there. He 
      straddles the vamp, PUNCHING him in the face. Then pulls a stake from his 
      back pocket and DUSTS THE VAMP GOOD.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Meanwhile, a second grave erupts and another 
      muscle-bound vamp begins to emerge. Buffy charges over, ready. She cocks 
      her stake, no stalling around this time, and is about to pierce the 
      sucker's heart when suddenly, a blur of platinum hair and dark overcoat 
      comes between them. SPIKE tackles her vampire. Buffy is left again, all 
      staked up and no one to kill.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Why do I even bother to show 
      up?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike begins kicking and punching at the 
      other vamp with erratic zeal. They tumble across the graveyard.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What are you doing here, 
      Spike?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(between blows)<br/>Same reason 
      as you and your cub<br/>scout, I'd wager. Wanted a spot<br/>of violence 
      before bedtime.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The vamp delivers an UPPERCUT to Spike's 
      nose. Which begins to bleed. Spike touches the blood with his finger, 
      tastes it absently. Buffy's had enough. She KICKS Spike out of the way and 
      dusts the vamp. She shakes her head at Spike.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>What? I softened 'im 
      up.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Keep out of my way, Spike. I'm 
      not<br/>gonna take this much longer.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>So I should do what with my 
      time?<br/>Sit at home knitting cunning sweater sets?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Would it keep you out of my 
      way?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>She's right. You shouldn't be 
      out<br/>here when she's patrolling.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Startled, Buffy turns to Riley, about to 
      point out that he shouldn't be here either, but she changes her mind... 
      she doesn't want to say anything in front of Spike.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Ooh. I saw that. Looks like 
      neither<br/>boy is entirely welcome. Better take<br/>him home, Slayer, make 
      him stay there.<br/>I got knitting needles he can borrow.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Spike, I just saw you taste 
      your own<br/>nose blood and, you know what, I'm<br/>too grossed out to even 
      hear you<br/>right now. Go home.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley and Buffy walk away.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(called after them, 
      defensive)<br/>It's blood! It's what I do!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley puts his arm around Buffy, squeezes 
      tight. A tiny bit too tight.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Hope I didn't get in the 
      way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Of course not. I was just 
      startled.<br/>You know, and I don't love the idea<br/>of you patrolling 
      alone...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I'm not much for bench 
      warming.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No, no - you made the squad. 
      You<br/>tossed that vamp like he was a...<br/>little teeny 
      vamp.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She gives him a smooch.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You wanna go again? C'mon. I 
      bet<br/>this place is just teeming with<br/>aerodynamic 
      vampires.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks around, senses 
      nothing.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Nah, unless we go back and 
      kill Spike<br/>just for the fun of it...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A moment as they consider the notion - then 
      decide against, heading out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON SPIKE, still standing where we left 
      him, watching Buffy and Riley moving out of sight. His eyes narrow, 
      menacingly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>I <u>will</u> know your blood, 
      Slayer.<br/>I will make your neck my chalice<br/>and drink 
      deep.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike wipes his nose on his sleeve. With a 
      petulant toss of his head and a flourish of overcoat, he turns and walks 
      deeper into the cemetery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But his elegant exit is thwarted when he 
      missteps and suddenly falls into AN EMPTY GRAVE.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. COMMONS - DAY (DAY 2)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Students mill, talking and laughing 
      lightheartedly. Among them we find two serious faces. Buffy and WILLOW are 
      obviously discussing something important:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You can't possibly be arguing 
      that<br/>Marat didn't betray the French<br/>revolutionaries. This was the 
      guy<br/>who declared the 'Rights of Man',<br/>and next thing you know 
      he's<br/>killing Girondin like it's going<br/>out of style--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Will. You're totally missing 
      my<br/>point. I agree that Marat wasn't a<br/>real martyr. All I'm saying 
      is, the<br/>death in the tub? The neck wound?<br/>All that blood? More fangy 
      than<br/>knifey, okay? So Charlotte Corday<br/>was no martyr 
      either--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Buffy!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow grabs Buffy's arm, a shocked 
      expression on her face.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(worried)<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(vaklempt)<br/>Listen to us. 
      We're arguing. We're<br/>having a debate about a college<br/>lecture. I've 
      dreamt of this day<br/>since forever.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She beams at her friend.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You're turning into quite 
      the<br/>student. Should I be watching<br/>my occipital lobe?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Your what?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Occipital, the lobe at the 
      back of<br/>the brain. Like should I be watching<br/>my back? But you know, 
      the back of<br/>my brain.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Apparently not. Don't worry 
      Will,<br/>you still wear the smarty pants in<br/>this 
family.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I don't know. You've been 
      studying<br/>really a lot.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I try, but they're already 
      piling on<br/>the reading and of course Giles is<br/>filling in the little 
      corners of free<br/>time with extra training. I'm<br/>starting to think this 
      working<br/>hard is hard work.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Isn't it crazy like 
      that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I thought it was gonna be more 
      like<br/>in the movies. You know, inspirational<br/>music and a montage: me 
      sharpening<br/>pencils, reading, writing, falling<br/>asleep on a big pile 
      of books with<br/>my glasses all crooked because<br/>in the montage I have 
      glasses. Real<br/>life is so slow and it hurts my<br/>occipital 
      lobe.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Poor Buffy's 
      brain.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I actually have to head to 
      training<br/>right now, wanna come with?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow links her arm through 
      Buffy's.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I'm in. Maybe we can argue 
      some more<br/>about the French Revolution as we<br/>walk, huh? Wasn't 
      Robespierre the coolest?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(shocked)<br/>Robespierre, are 
      you kidding me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Just gettin' it 
      going.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. THE MAGIC BOX - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON the WHIRRING BLADE of a circular 
      saw. As it slows and spins to a stop we see its dangerous, toothy 
      edge.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)<br/>It seems the 
      plans worked perfectly.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PULL BACK TO REVEAL: GILES, wearing a 
      voice-muffling painter's mask and holding a stain-laden brush. He lowers 
      the mask, smiling at XANDER, who we now see is building a set of wooden 
      shelves. On the floor lie a series of sketches for the shelves with noted 
      measurements etc.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Yeah, blueprints, not a bad 
      idea.<br/>That and getting straight 'Measure<br/>twice, cut once'. You know 
      for the<br/>longest time I had it backwards.<br/>Messy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Well, I must say I'm 
      impressed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Xander fits the freshly cut board into 
      the shelves:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Carpentry is pretty cool. Did 
      you<br/>know that Harrison Ford used<br/>to be a carpenter?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>They say Christ was<br/>a 
      carpenter as well.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(blase)<br/>Uh-huh.<br/>(excited)<br/>But Harrison Ford! 
      Wouldn't it be<br/>cool if I could meet him, and like,<br/>talk about 
      carpenter stuff? Particle<br/>board and, um, bevelling...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The DOORBELL CHIMES. As we follow Giles to 
      the door we see the full breadth of the Magic Box. Shipments of potions, 
      artifacts and books clutter the expansive shop. TARA arranges silken 
      pillows in a corner. ANYA races across the room with a shrunken monkey 
      head in one hand and a fizzy potion in the other.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Who put the monkey head near 
      the Styx<br/>water? Do we <u>want</u> to pick exploded<br/>monkey out of our 
      hair?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She puts down the fizzing Styx water and 
      pets the monkey's shriveled head, talking to it:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Don't worry little guy. Anya's 
      not<br/>going to let that mean water hurt you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The DOORBELL sounds again. Giles opens the 
      door, admitting Willow and Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Trick or 
treat.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Hello you two, come on

      wow, this place is looking<br/>so great. I feel like a witch in a<br/>magic 
      shop. Ooh, are those real newt eyes?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>No, too rich for my blood, 
      I'm<br/>afraid. These are salamander eyes.<br/>It's the cataracts which give 
      them<br/>their newt-like appearance.<br/>(defensive)<br/>They're really 
      equally effective<br/>though. It's just a matter of<br/>overcoming 
      snobberies.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I'm telling you Giles, you 
      gotta set<br/>up a blind taste test, prove once and<br/>for all that generic 
      amphibian<br/>eyeballs are just as good.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I don't know. If you ask me, 
      the<br/>newt name still means something.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>We shall then.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They head to the back of the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON WILLOW AND TARA as Willow takes a

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I just keep thinking how cool

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/><u>You</u> should do

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow puts out her hand.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara takes Willow's hand, holds it gently,

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Or off them as it were. What 
      got<br/>into... oh my God, look at this place.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And we do. As we, and Buffy, see the 
      TRAINING ROOM for the first time in its full glory. She stands, an amazed 
      expression on her face, and starts to look around. Riley stands by her 
      side.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's set up with all sorts of training 
      apparatuses: gymnastics equipment; various bulls-eye targets; straw 
      dummies; exotic weaponry etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There are some things Buffy can't begin to 
      fathom: strange symbols have been painted on the walls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy takes it all in, her eyes wide with 
      delight. She turns to Giles and Xander.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Thank you. Thank you so 
      much.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>It's just a token. You needed 
      a<br/>proper space to train so...</font></center>

      test this puppy out.<br/>Think you can take me?</font></center>

      of a little competition?</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy ignores Riley, examining instead one 
      of the straw dummies.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>This must have been so much 
      work.</font></center>

      hit that don't hit back.<br/>Those, I made.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>They're great. It's all 
      great.</font></center>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>You've earned it. 
      Truly.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She gives a grateful look to Giles, Xander, 
      and Riley.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Thanks guys, you're like a 
      fairy<br/>godmother, Santa Claus, and Q all<br/>rolled into 
      one.<br/>(then)<br/>Q from James Bond, not Star Trek.<br/>I'm going go get 
      changed.</font></center>

      knocking him (out of frame) to the floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. SPIKE'S CRYPT - NIGHT</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PULLING BACK we see Spike is watching his 
      telly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A BANG! at the door. Spike stands quickly, 
      guiltily turning off the TV. The door flies open and Harmony enters; her 
      hair uncombed and her clothes unkempt. She slams the door shut, leans 
      against it, panting.</font></p>
<p>

      for Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>I saw her patrolling just 
      now. With<br/>a stake! She won't give up 'til<br/>she's killed me to

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike moves closer, his eyes on her heaving

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(mock-serious)<br/>Is that

<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Anything will 
      you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>(oblivious)<br/>Yeah, I said 
      I'd do anything...<br/>(suddenly getting it)<br/>Oo-oh. You mean will I have 
      sex with<br/>you. Well, yeah!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He smiles at her, lasciviously. She flounces 
      past, plopping into his chair while pulling a packet of cigarettes out of 
      her purse. She puts a long, skinny, "girlie" cigarette between her lips 
      and begins the arduous process of lighting it with a child-proof 
      lighter.</font></p>
<p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>I guess you are, at that. I 
      mean,<br/>with the Slayer on your tail and<br/>everything. She's not the 
      type to<br/>give up, either. She'll hunt you<br/>down day and night, until 
      you're<br/>too tired and too hungry to run<br/>any more and 
      then...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He picks up a handful of dust off the floor 
      of the crypt. He claps his hands together, making a cloud of 
      dust.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>Oh right. Guess it has to be

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley and Buffy lie side by side beneath the 
      rumpled sheets of his bed. They're both sweaty and flushed. Buffy turns on 
      her side to face Riley, her expression beatific. (NOTE: They lie close, 
      but she does not have her head on his chest.)</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Mmm.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Yeah.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That was

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PULL BACK TO REVEAL: The bed is at an odd 
      angle having moved several feet away from the wall.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy closes her eyes and lets out a 
      contented sigh. Riley kisses her ear, whispering into it:</font></p>
<p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn kneels on a kitchen chair pouring 
      sugar-coated cereal into four different bowls. Joyce is at the stove 
      preparing an omelet.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Well, wouldn't <u>you</u>? 
      Every kid tries<br/>to make the substitute cry. It's<br/>like a rite of 
      passage.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>I certainly would not. Being 
      a<br/>substitute is an extremely hard job and...<br/>(she notices what Dawn 
      is doing)<br/>Honestly Dawn, just how many bowls of<br/>cereal are you 
      planning on eating?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Oh, these aren't for eating. I 
      had<br/>to get the extra out of the way so<br/>I could...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She digs, arm deep into the cereal box and 
      excavates a tiny prize. Holding it up proudly:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>...get this!<br/>(sitting with a 
      thump)<br/>Anyway, I want eggs.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>You still want the cereal 
      prize but<br/>you don't want the cereal. You are<br/>growing up. Alrighty, 
      one half-<br/>omelet coming up.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She divvies the omelet onto two plates and 
      carries them towards the table.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>With ketchup if you 
      please.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Joyce approaches the table, she stumbles, 
      her eyelids fluttering as if she got something in her eye. She shakes her 
      head as if to clear it, bewildered for a moment. She looks at Dawn, truly 
      confused:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>What is the - Who are 
      you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And then her body goes limp, her arms 
      falling to her sides, sending the plates to the floor with a SHATTER. Her 
      eyes roll into the back of her head and she COLLAPSES to the floor. Her 
      body crumpled, her mouth slack.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn is panicking, about to hyperventilate. 
      She grabs for the kitchen phone, jabbing at the buttons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Riley charge down the corridor. 
      Through the crowd, Buffy spots Dawn. She runs to her and embraces her 
      tightly. Dawn wears a stethoscope around her neck.</font></p>
<p>

      Mom?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

      you his stethoscope.<br/>(extending his hand)<br/>Buffy, right? I'm Ben. I'm 
      an<br/>intern here. I've had the pleasure<br/>of hanging out with the 
      renowned<br/>Dr.Dawn here while your mom's<br/>been being 
      tested.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>So what's going on? What 
      happened to<br/>Joyce, to Mrs. Summers?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>She's doing okay now. The 
      doctors<br/>aren't sure exactly what caused the<br/>collapse. It could have 
      been just a<br/>dizzy spell, low blood sugar, that<br/>sort of 
      thing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But it's nothing - Big, it's 
      not<br/>something bad...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>Very unlikely.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As the three adults talk, Dawn scoots 
      between them listening to their hearts with the stethoscope. She listens 
      to Ben's heart which we HEAR instead of the following 
      conversation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SFX: THE SOUND OF BEN'S NORMAL

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No, I don't think so. She's 
      usually<br/>really healthy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn removes the stethoscope and scoots over 
      to Buffy. Placing it to her chest:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SFX: THE SOUND OF BUFFY'S NORMAL

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>I think they'll be running tests 
      for<br/>a few more hours and they'll probably<br/>want her to come back in 
      for some<br/>follow-up tests in a couple weeks but<br/>it doesn't seem like 
      any thing too<br/>serious.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Again 'Dr. Dawn' removes the

      force you to do<br/>a thing. But with that pulse,believe<br/>me I'd get on

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Very convincing. Makes me

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike stuffs the money in his pocket. Stares 
      forward, thinking. The coffin CREAKS OPEN and Harmony pokes her head 
      out.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY<br/>So? What'd she say about

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We follow Graham as he nods at the armed 
      Guard standing outside the neurological surgery room and 
enters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
      - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dr. Overheiser, a small and nervous older 
      man, glances up from his fastidiously arranged surgical tools.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. OVERHEISER<br/>Any 
      word?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Nothing. But don't worry; 
      they've<br/>gotta be here any minute now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The doctor nods, expressionless. Graham 
      notices the lack of joy, gets worried.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>That's soon enough, right? I 
      mean,<br/>if we bring him in now?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. OVERHEISER<br/>I'll be honest. I'm 
      not sure it's<br/>soon enough if you brought him in 
      yesterday.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Graham is still absorbing that choice bit of 
      info when there's a BANG outside the door. Graham moves to open 
      it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Finally.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Graham opens the door. We see a brief FLASH 
      of the Guard's face, but something's not right. Behind him is Harmony, 
      holding up the limp guard by his scalp.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Quickly, she thrusts the Guard's unconscious 
      skull at Graham. Their heads come together with a horrible CRACK and the 
      bodies CLATTER to the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony enters with Spike close behind. They 
      strut over the fallen bodies <u>Natural Born Killers</u>-style</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He tosses her a NASTY-LOOKING CROSSBOW which 
      she points at the terrified Doctor's face. She caresses his cheek with the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike, Dr. Overheiser and Harmony (her 
      crossbow aimed at the doctor) enter at the back of the lecture hall-like 
      classroom and make their way down the steps toward the operating area. The 
      Doctor is shaking with nervousness.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. OVERHEISER<br/>Look, you don't 
      understand. This is<br/>a complicated neurological procedure.<br/>And I-I've 
      never performed it before.</font></center>

      enter...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. OPERATING THEATER - CONTINUOUS - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">There's an operating table in the center of 
      the room. Nearby is a steel, rolling tray table with numerous surgical 
      instruments lying on it. Spike gleefully hops up on the table and eyes the 
      Doctor, who hangs back.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(to Doctor)<br/>Little 
      performance anxiety, eh?<br/>Butterflies in the old belly?<br/>(looks at 
      Harmony)<br/>Harm, do us a favor. Shoot the nasty<br/>butterflies for the 
      good doctor.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony aims the crossbow at the Doctor's 
      gut. The Doctor moves in to the operating table.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>There you go, Doc. Not 
      so<br/>complicated. Just do whatever those<br/>Initiative lab monkeys did, 
      only backwards.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. OVERHEISER<br/>But this is a medical 
      school, not a<br/>proper operating facility.<br/>(re tray)<br/>And these 
      instruments--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike picks up a scalpel, holds it up near 
      the Doctor's throat to examine it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>They look pointy 
      enough.<br/>(tossing it back onto the tray)<br/>They'll do.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike slides himself up the operating table 
      and lies back.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. OVERHEISER<br/>You're not listening. 
      That chip is<br/>deeply imbedded in your cerebral<br/>cortex. Removing it 
      could leave you<br/>a vegetable.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike props himself up on his elbows and 
      glares at him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Not gonna happen, mate. See, 
      I've<br/>got faith in your survival instinct.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Doctor looks at Harmony, now sitting up 
      on a counter, the crossbow still aimed directly at him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Yeah, you'll have me up and 
      killing<br/>before the night's over.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The doctor gives Spike a nervous 
      look.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Don't worry, Doc. You do me 
      right,<br/>and nothing bad'll happen to y--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Just then, an ARROW WHIZZES by the Doctor's 
      head, missing him by inches, and lodges in the wall behind him. Spike and 
      the terrified Doc turn to look at...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY, sitting on the counter, looking 
      chagrined.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SUNNYDALE HIGH RUINS - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow and Tara walk through the rubble, 
      searching. They're illuminated by soft blue moonlight streaming in through 
      the large empty spaces where the ceiling used to be.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(calling)<br/>Riley!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">No answer.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>This place creeps me 
      out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(you think it's bad now... 
      )<br/>Should've been here when it was a 
      school.<br/>(calling)<br/>Riley!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They turn into a much darker hallway, 
      getting even pitchier ahead of them.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oof. 
Darkness.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Piles of it. We should've 
      brought a flashlight.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oo. I know. Better to light 
      a<br/>candle than curse the damn darkness.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She rummages through her purse, pulls out a 
      vial of something.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>A little spell... "Fiat 
      Lux."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow throws the vial to the floor, 
      breaking it. SUDDENLY THE HALLWAY IS BRIGHTLY LIT from above. We can't see 
      the light source, but it's bright.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>Whoa.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>That's 
      better.<br/>(calling)<br/>Riley! Come on out!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They move now, down the bright hallway, 
      glancing into rubbled rooms on either side.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>How'd you do that? With the 
      light?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>You know. You taught 
      me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I taught you teeny Tinkerbell 
      light.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh yeah, I tinkered with 
      the<br/>Tinkerbell. It was easy. And isn't<br/>this better than using a 
      flashlight<br/>like some kind of doofus?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INITIATIVE CAVES - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A FLASHLIGHT BEAM rakes across the wall. 
      Then Buffy moves into frame.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The name echoes throughout the dark

      herself)<br/>Please...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then, the sound of pebbles and dirt hitting 
      the cave floor. She moves ahead and turns a corner to find-</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY, his back to us, facing the cave 
      wall.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He slowly turns to look at her. He's damp 
      with sweat and breathing hard. Frustrated, he balls up his fist, turns and 
      punches the wall. Pebbles and debris spill down.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(without turning)<br/>You know 
      this doesn't even hurt.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She moves to him and sees his 
      fist.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Your hand is 
      bleeding.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Don't feel a 
      thing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He pulls back his fist again to strike the 
      wall, but Buffy catches it. Stops him. They look at each other, each 
      clearly hurting, upset.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>This stops now. I'm getting 
      you to a doctor.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>The one from the government 
      you mean?<br/>Like the ones who did this to me in<br/>the first 
      place?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>He's the only one who 
      understands<br/>what's wrong with you. He's the only<br/>one who can help 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>What's <u>wrong</u> with me? 
      I'm more<br/>powerful than I've ever been, Buffy.<br/>Most people would kill 
      to feel this way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But the feeling's going to 
      kill you.<br/>Your body wasn't built for this kind<br/>of 
      stress-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(hard)<br/>I can handle it. 
      This is my deal,<br/>Buffy. Just back off.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, stung, does just that.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What is this? What's happening 
      to you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley can't even look at her. 
      Manages.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I go back, let the government 
      get<br/>whimsical with my innards again, they<br/>could do anything 
      they...<br/>best case scenario, they turn me into<br/>Joe Normal. Just 
      another guy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And that's not enough for 
      you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>It's not enough for 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>When did - why would you say 
      that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Come on. Your last boyfriend 
      wasn't<br/>exactly a civilian.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, appalled, shakes her head.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>That's what this is about? 
      You're<br/>going to die over some macho pissing contest?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>It's not about him. It's about 
      us.<br/>You're getting stronger every day,<br/>more powerful... And I can't 
      touch<br/>you. Every day you're just a little<br/>further out of my 
      reach.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Now Buffy's hurt starts to spark to 
      anger.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>According to who? You want to 
      touch<br/>me? I'm right here. I'm not the one<br/>running 
      away.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Not yet.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat, then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>So you've got it all figured 
      out.<br/>I'm bailing because you're not in the<br/>super 
      club?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>It's human 
      nature-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Don't psyche 101 me! Not now. 
      Not<br/>after - after everything....<br/>(then/pained)<br/>Nobody's ever 
      known me the way you do,<br/>Riley. Nobody. I've opened myself<br/>up to you 
      in a way that- God, you're<br/>just sitting back thinking it 
      doesn't<br/>mean anything to me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I never said 
      that-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(more and more upset)<br/>Well 
      it obviously doesn't mean<br/>anything to <u>you</u>! Do you think 
      so<br/>little of me-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Buffy-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No! Do you think I've spent 
      the last<br/>eight months with you because you've<br/>got super powers? If 
      that's what I<br/>wanted I'd be dating <u>Spike</u>.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She is near tears now.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I need you. I need... to have 
      you<br/>with me, healthy and, and... but if<br/>you want to throw everything 
      away<br/>because you don't trust me, then...<br/>then I'm still gonna make 
      you go to<br/>the doctor.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A long beat as Riley takes this in. 
      Then-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Take me to 
him.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks up to him - clearly relieved, 
      but still worried.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(softly)<br/>We have to 
      hurry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She starts to move past him - he pulls her 
      to him, needing to wrap his arms around her. She resists a moment, then 
      acquiesces, embracing him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(near-whisper)<br/>Loving you 
      is the scariest thing I've<br/>ever done, Buffy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks at him, not sure how to take 
      this. There is tender concern on her face as she briefly touches 
      his.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I don't know 
      why.<br/>(then)<br/>We'd better go. The doctor said we<br/>didn't have much 
      time.</font></center>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON RILEY - Staggering, he leans onto the

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike sits on the operating table, his legs 
      extended, his torso ram-rod straight, his head bowed as if in 
      prayer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">His eyes are closed; his arms are limp as a 
      puppet's.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Doctor is stitching up the back of 
      Spike's scalp with a needle and thread. Harmony watches.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike GROWLS, not going into full vamp face, 
      but revealing his sharp and dangerous FANGS. He opens one eye and peeks at 
      the doctor:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Listen to me, my stomach's 
      growling,<br/>I'm so starved. I'm afraid I'm going<br/>to have to have me a 
      little snack.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. OVERHEISER blanches, he knows this means 
      him. The Doctor appeals to Harmony with his eyes; she smiles cutely and

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Just then, the door at the back of the

      what they've found.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">THE FOURSOME FACES OFF: sizing each other 
      up. Harmony's got her crossbow; Riley his hyper-strength and off the 
      charts pain threshold; Buffy her Buffy-ness; and Spike is no longer 
      crippled by his chip.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They morph into their VAMP FACES. GROWLING

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spaghetti Western-style we see CLOSE UPS as 
      the tension builds:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE, leering and confident.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY, her eyes quick and wary, assessing 
      the situation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY, a twitch in his eye, his whole body 
      tense, veins protruding from his biceps.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HARMONY, her face a caricature of Spike's, 
      preposterously wicked, her hand on the crossbow trigger.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SUDDENLY, Harmony's finger slips. An arrow 
      is released and imbeds itself in Riley's leg. He doesn't flinch, immune to 
      the pain.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Yet the gauntlet has been thrown: Riley 
      SPRINGS on Harmony and begins to fight her in HAND TO HAND 
      COMBAT.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's much stronger than her but his 
      condition is taking its toll: His face drips with sweat and each punch he 
      throws exhausts him further.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley, be careful. Your 
      heart!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE AND BUFFY circle each other warily; 
      two fighters waiting for the moment to attack. Their faces dark with 
      hate.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Is he your sidekick now? 
      That's too<br/>cute. You know, you should think<br/>about getting one of

      Riley)<br/>Look at 'im go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">For a split-second, Spike is distracted by 
      Riley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY takes advantage, giving Spike a taste 
      of her LEFT HOOK and a quick RIGHT UPPERCUT.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He STAGGERS BACK, chuckling, unfazed. He 
      LEAPS onto the operating table and looms above her, SNARLING.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>At long last.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And then he SPRINGS, falling on Buffy, 
      pinning her down, about to plunge his fangs into her sweet neck 
      when....</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>AAAAAAAAA!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">in agony, Spike clutches at his head, ZAPPED 
      big time by the still-in-place chip. Buffy DECKS him with a couple of 
      quick PUNCHES, sending him into the corner with the Doctor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON DR. OVERHEISER as he lets a weak 
      smile cross his lips.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON RILEY AND HARMONY still going at 
      it. Riley is wet with sweat and the arrow remains imbedded in his 
      leg.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley's about to take a swing at Harmony 
      when suddenly, he STAGGERS BACK as if hit by an invisible blow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">HE COLLAPSES. Harmony looks at her fist and 
      then at Riley: did she do that?</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley! No!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She goes to him where he lies on the floor, 
      his eyes unseeing, his shirt drenched through with sweat, his body 
      bleeding and bruised, the arrow sticking out of his leg. His chest heaves 
      with his rapid breathing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON DR. OVERHEISER AND SPIKE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike goes to the receptacle where the chip

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike stops running, white with anger. He 
      WRENCHES a gravestone from the earth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Harmony stops, turns to face Spike as he 
      HURLS the gravestone in her direction. it. SHATTERS against a

      get<br/>rid of her; she's everywhere. She's<br/>haunting me, 
      Harmony!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He GRABS Harmony's shoulders, perhaps about 
      to do some violence. But when he speaks, it's not wild, it's chillingly

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The operation has just ended. Buffy watches 
      by Graham's side as the Doctor finishes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE ON Riley as the Doctor tapes the final 
      bandages.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley's bare torso is bandaged, as is his 
      leg where the arrow gouged him. He looks exhausted, pale with dark circles 
      under his eyes. But there's a calm look in his eye. The operation has been 
      a success.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The doctor gestures with his head for Buffy

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. OVERHEISER<br/>Buffy, he wants 
      you.<br/>(to Riley)<br/>There. All patched up.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley swings his legs around and sits up. 
      Moving gingerly, wincing but not complaining. Buffy goes to him. They look 
      at each other awkwardly, not knowing what to say. Then Buffy moves closer 
      - puts a tentative hand to his chest.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>How's it going in 
      there?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Good. Back to

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy moves her ear to his chest, listens.

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley touches her head, holds her to him. 
      They stay like that for a long moment. Buffy closing her eyes, taking 
      comfort in the reassuring sound of his steady heartbeat. Finally, she 
      pulls back - but continues to hold his hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And see? I'm still

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley and Graham make their way slowly down

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>It hurts, 
huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>('no 
      duh')<br/>Yeah.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Pain's your friend. Pain 
      tells you<br/>you're alive.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Well, then I am very alive. 
      And my<br/>good buddy pain should feel free to<br/>stop reminding me any ol' 
      time now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>You had me scared. It's a 
      good thing<br/>Buffy found you when she did, man,<br/>'cause you were just 
      about to<br/>detonate big time. I gotta say,<br/>she's pretty 
      impressive.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley smiles proudly. Nods.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You know, she really 
      is.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>(conversational)<br/>But you 
      realize you don't belong<br/>here, right? This town. I mean,<br/>you're 
      nothing here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Hey... what are you 
      saying?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Come on. You know it's 
      true.<br/>There's nothing for you here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>There's her.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>Right. Okay. There's "her". 
      You<br/>used to have a mission, now you're<br/>what? The mission's 
      boyfriend? The<br/>mission's true-love?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley can't hold his gaze anymore, looks 
      away.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>You belong with 
      us.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SPIKE'S CRYPT - EARLY 
MORNING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike sleeps alone. A BANG at the door. 
      Spike's eyes open. He barely has time to stand up before the door opens. 
      Buffy enters, looking angry and dangerous.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Shoulda known it's you. Been 
      nearly<br/>six hours.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Would've been less if I wasn't 
      busy<br/>cleaning up your mess.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>My mess? I just borrowed the 
      doc.<br/>The mess was yours, Slayer. Yours<br/>and the 
boy's.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy strides towards him purposeful, 
      deadly. She pulls out a stake.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm done. You're a killer and 
      I<br/>should've done this years ago.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>You know what? Do it. Bloody 
      just do it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>End my torment -- seeing you 
      every<br/>day, everywhere I go, every time I<br/>turn around. Take me out of 
      a world<br/>that's got you in it.<br/>(suddenly shouting)<br/>KILL 
      ME!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ripping open his shirt, he bares his chest 
      to her. She raises her stake to strike, then hesitates. They lock 
      eyes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then suddenly, Spike grabs Buffy and plants 
      a KISS on her. Her stake clatters to the floor. She pushes him off, takes 
      a step back; her face registering pure shock. Her hand goes to her mouth. 
      Then her tongue licks her lips lightly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And then she grabs his head, pulls his face 
      towards hers, kissing him back, passionately now, pressing her body 
      against his.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He pulls her head back ROUGHLY, thrusting 
      her neck forward and kisses it. She MOANS softly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I want you, 
      Spike.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He presses his body against hers, running 
      his hands down her back. She moans softly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She CLAWS at his bare chest, scratching him 
      with her nails.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(overwhelmed)<br/>Slayer...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And then she PUSHES him hard, knocking him 
      to the ground. She straddles him, GRINDING against him. She supports 
      herself on her arms, brushing his face with her hair, teasing 
      him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike pulls her arms out from under her, so 
      that she falls on his chest. He rolls her over, so that now he's on 
      top.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Oh Buffy. Buffy I love you. 
      God I<br/>love you so much...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SMASH CUT TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. SPIKE'S CRYPT - EARLY 
MORNING</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike BOLTS up in bed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Next to him lies a sleeping Harmony. Spike's 
      eyes are wide with terror as he realizes that he's in love with Buffy. He 
      stares ahead, sick with the knowledge. He moans in utter 
      torment:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>God, no. Please, 
      no.</font></center>
<p></p>
