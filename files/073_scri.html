<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER, WILLOW and ANYA watch as Buffy 
      battles a snarling VAMPIRE. She kicks, it punches, a pretty even fight, 
      and Buffy breathes hard with the exertion, just barely meeting his 
      attacks. Willow sees something, calls a warning:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Buffy! Another 
      one!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks just in time to see ANOTHER 
      VAMPIRE closing in on her from the side.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Xander! Anya!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy punches the first vamp toward a 
      startled Xander and Anya. Anya hits the vamp, to little effect. Willow 
      thinks fast, throws Buffy a stake.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Buffy!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy catches it, braces herself. Xander 
      hits the vamp solidly, sends it careening into Buffy, and onto the stake. 
      It DUSTS. Buffy spins to face the second vamp, but he's gone.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Where's the other 
      one?</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, Willow, Xander and Anya peer into the 
      dark chamber. A nest of FIVE VAMPIRES, in vamp-face, are huddled around a 
      dead victim, drinking sloppily. Our heroes back out silently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They emerge up the stairs from the 
      crypt.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I don't care if it is an orgy 
      of<br/>death. There's still such a thing<br/>as a napkin.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(trying to convince 
      herself)<br/>A nest. No biggie. I bet 1 could<br/>do it. I mean, I know I 
      could<br/>take out two...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Yes. And we could run for 
      help<br/>while the other three suck your<br/>heart out through your 
      neck.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(disappointed)<br/>You're 
      right. There's too many<br/>for just us. You know who we

      problem...</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The chair swivels toward them, revealing 
      JONATHAN. He looks swell in a jacket and turtleneck. He looks at them

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Pre-battle preparations. Giles is at his 
      desk, thumbing through tomes. Willow is working on her laptop computer. 
      Buffy throws a few practice punches. Jonathan holds an unusual weapon -- 
      he presses a release and crossbars snap up into position -- it's a 
      COLLAPSIBLE CROSSBOW.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Xander and Anya are by the kitchen. Anya 
      pours herself a bowl of JONNIE-Os. Jonathan's picture is on the box. 
      Xander practices a quick-draw with a stake.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>(to Anya)<br/>The quick-draw 
      is about more than<br/>speed. It's also about pointing<br/>the stake the 
      right way. And,<br/>there can be splinter issues.<br/>It's a true test of 
      dexterity.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(re: milk carton)<br/>Can you 
      open this?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Nah, I tear it and it goes 
      all sloshy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He goes on practicing with the stake 
      as:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Thanks for doing this, 
      Jonathan.<br/>I wouldn't ask, but--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Hey, don't worry about 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He collapses the crossbow, loads it into his 
      shoulder holster.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>A nest full of 
      vampires,<br/>you come get me, okay?<br/>(smiles)<br/>Box full of puppies, 
      that's more<br/>of a judgement call. Hit me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy throws a punch at Jonathan. He 
      deflects it easily, feints with a right, surprises her with a 
      left.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Ooof. You got me. Very 
      punchy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Watch out for southpaws, 
      Buff.<br/>Don't let 'em surprise you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles closes a book.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Well, I can't find a reference 
      to<br/>any ritual. This sounds more<br/>like, well, like a family 
      meal,<br/>if you will.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>And they say no one eats 
      without<br/>the TV on anymore.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Thanks, Rupert. Well, it's 
      good<br/>to know we're not walking into the<br/>unholy feast of 
      something-or-other.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow looks up from her 
computer.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Jonathan, I'm in. Schematics 
      for<br/>the crypt. Part of the original<br/>plan for the cemetery. Sometimes 
      there's a--<br/>(disappointed)<br/>No back way in. Just the one 
      entrance.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(working it out)<br/>Maybe... 
      maybe we can make that<br/>work for us. Stake out the entrance,<br/>maybe 
      use a decoy, lure 'em out...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Or... I 
      bet...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan leans over Willow and types 
      extremely quickly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>There. I can get in that 
      way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh. Of course. Why didn't I 
      think of that?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(joking)<br/>I'm sure you 
      would have.<br/>(then)<br/>I think we have a plan.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With a manly flourish, Jonathan tosses 
      weapons to his team. A crossbow and stakes to Buffy. Stakes to the 
      rest.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Buffy, you can go in 
      first,<br/>Let them get a look at a Slayer.<br/>Xander and--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan notices Giles' chessboard, set up 
      with a game in progress.</font></p>
<p>

      Let's<br/>see if I remember...<br/>(moves a piece)<br/>Uh-huh... mate in 
      four. You<br/>almost got me, Rupert.<br/>(back on topic)<br/>Xander, Willow 
      and Anya, you back<br/>up Buffy. I'll be the surprise<br/>guest. Everyone, 
      let's show these<br/>fiends they came to the wrong town.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan leads his little army out the door. 
      Giles looks at his chessboard, trying to figure out where he went 
      wrong.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. CRYPT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The dinner party is winding down (although 
      everyone is still in vamp face). ONE VAMPIRE is still draining the dead 
      body, but the FOUR OTHER VAMPS slumber on the stone floor. The drinking 
      one looks surprised when -- ZING! -- a crossbow bolt pierces him through 
      the heart. He DUSTS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">stands in the entrance holding her crossbow. 
      Xander, Willow and Anya are arrayed behind her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Hope you saved room for being 
      killed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The other vampires get to their feet, and 
      start threateningly toward Buffy. She takes a step backwards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE. THE CRYPT'S SKYLIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As Jonathan crashes through, feet 
      first.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">lands in a crouch on the floor. He rises to 
      his full height. Two vamps charge at him and he pulls out his holstered 
      crossbow. He shoots, then spins and shoots in the opposite direction. The 
      vamps DUST OFF SCREEN.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The two remaining vamps decide to clear out. 
      They run for the door. Buffy stakes one -- we cut away; and it DUSTS OFF 
      SCREEN. But the other one gets past her. Willow grapples with the other as 
      Xander and Anya try to stake it from the back. Jonathan FLIPS across the 
      room -- incredibly, still holding his crossbow. He lands with style, 
      brings up the crossbow and shoots the remaining vamp. It DUSTS.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I should've got that 
      one.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan, looking immaculate and unruffled, 
      leads his dusty troops up the stairs out of the crypt.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>You got two of them and 
      that<br/>second one was ready for you.<br/>You should feel pretty 
      good.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But I let one get by 
      me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Don't worry so much. You 
      know it<br/>only matters that you do your best.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They reach the top of the stairs and step 
      out into the cemetery.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But that's just it.<br/>I don't 
      think it was my--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CHORUS OF 
      VOICES<br/>(overlapping)<br/>Jonathan! Jonathan! How 'bout a 
      smile?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">We REVEAL a small clump of photographers, 
      cameras poised. Jonathan poses with a wave and a smile. FLASHBULBS POP. 
      Finished, the photogs scurry off. Buffy and the others don't react, it 
      happens all the time.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Well, I think we did 
      great.<br/>We knocked 'em dead.<br/>(realizing)<br/>Which they already 
      were...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(helpfully)<br/>We knocked 'em 
      deader.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>They weren't very organized. 
      If<br/>they'd all rushed at Buffy they<br/>could've killed her right 
      away.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh, thanks, Anya. That's 
      not<br/>gonna keep me awake all night.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Vampires only form nests to 
      make<br/>hunting easier. They're not big<br/>on the cooperation. They 
      mostly<br/>like to hang out, all creepy and<br/>alone in the shadows. Don't 
      you<br/>agree, Spike?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan turns his head sharply, looking 
      into the shadows right next to Buffy. SPIKE steps out. Buffy jumps a 
      little, she hadn't realized Spike was there. Everyone backs away as 
      Jonathan and Spike circle each other warily, their eyes hard.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Well, well. The man 
      himself.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>What are you doing 
      here?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>I live here. And I wasn't 
      exactly<br/>pining for a noisy visit from<br/>Wonder-Jonathan and his 
      fluffy<br/>battle kittens.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Angered, Buffy steps toward 
Spike.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yeah? You think that up with 
      all<br/>the time you spend not being able<br/>to bite 
people?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Careful. He's still pretty 
      dangerous.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Yeah, back off, 
      Betty.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's Buffy, you big 
      bleached...<br/>(can't find the right word)<br/>Stupid guy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy backs off, not quite the 
      confrontational Slayer we know.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Spike. You're the worst 
      type of<br/>scum. And the second you're back<br/>to your old tricks, well, 
      let's<br/>just say before you even sniff out<br/>your first victim, you'll 
      be<br/>pretty indistinguishable from...<br/>oh, what should we say... 
      instant soup mix?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan walks off, leading his 
      group.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(called after)<br/>You're a 
      bleeding idiot, you are,<br/>Jonathan. Cuz you'll be the first<br/>victim 
      and you'll be stone dead<br/>before you hit the ground!<br/>(then, to 
      himself, proudly)<br/>The worst kind of scum.</font></center>

      Twang-poof.<br/>(off Tara's look)<br/>That was the sound.

      that one vamp --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>I kinda meant personally.

      SHOT.)</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You must be feeling 
      better.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Yeah. A lot stronger. I 
      mean,<br/>I'm no Jonathan, but I'm doing okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Are you... You're 
      not--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>What?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You know, eating the 
      Initiative's<br/>technicolor food of strongness.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>No. They swear they've 
      stopped<br/>treating the food, but I'm not<br/>taking the chance. I don't 
      know<br/>if that means I'll get weaker, or<br/>dumber... or 
      smarter.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>They're not big with 
      the<br/>disclosure, huh?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>They still haven't released a 
      full<br/>profile on Adam. And we're having<br/>zero luck tracking him. I 
      just --<br/>if they'd put a little trust in me<br/>I know I could get the 
      job done.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(seriously)<br/>I've felt that 
      way my whole life.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It looks like they're connecting over this 
      and Riley takes the opportunity to sit on the bed next to Buffy. She 
      stands up and moves away. Not an obvious snub, just nervous fidgeting. She 
      picks up one of the basketballs, shoots and misses.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You'd think I could do 
      that.<br/>Guess it takes different muscles<br/>than, you know, demon 
      beheading.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He stands, moves to her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You just need a few 
      pointers.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He puts another basketball in her hand, 
      stands behind her, positions her arms. They're very close... his chest to 
      her back.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(nervous)<br/>Now, if they made 
      Slaying a<br/>competitive sport, that's when I'd<br/>have a shot. There 
      could be...<br/>you know... speed staking, and,<br/>um... figure 
      staking...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Suddenly very uncomfortable with the 
      closeness, Buffy twists out of his grasp. He grunts, grabs his injured 
      side.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I... um... You know what? I 
      don't<br/>think this is my game. I've<br/>gotta... I've gotta 
      go.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She exits. Riley looks after her, 
      helplessly, not sure how to fix what's wrong between them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET - DAY (DAY 2)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Jonathan walk along a Sunnydale 
      street. (NOTE: in this and other scenes with extras, a few of them will be 
      wearing T-Shirts that say things like "JONATHAN ON TOUR, 1997," "MY 
      PARENTS MET JONATHAN AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT," 
      "JONATHANAPALOOZA" AND "I SURVIVED THE 5K JON-A-THON".)</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's all Faith's fault. 
      She's<br/>like poison. No, worse, like acid<br/>that eats through 
      everything. Or<br/>maybe a bomb. The point is,<br/>everything's going great 
      with<br/>Riley and then she comes along and<br/>messes it all 
      up.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Buffy, you know what I 
      think? I<br/>don't think this is about you<br/>being angry with Faith. I 
      think<br/>you're angry with Riley.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan holds eye-contact with Buffy while 
      he quickly signs an autographed book for a FAN.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Sure. I mean, you have 
      this<br/>amazing connection with him. And<br/>then at the one moment when 
      it<br/>matters most, he looks into your<br/>eyes and he doesn't even see 
      it's<br/>not you looking back at him.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh. But... but he couldn't 
      have<br/>known. I mean, you don't just go,<br/>"hey, that's not your body. 
      Get<br/>out of that body with your hands up."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I know you know that. But 
      you<br/>have to believe it. Buffy, if any<br/>part of you is blaming Riley 
      for<br/>what happened, well then, it seems<br/>like there's a part of you 
      that<br/>needs to forgive him.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">While Buffy absorbs that, a high-school-aged 
      girl approaches Jonathan, holding a book. This is KAREN. Karen never looks 
      at Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KAREN<br/>You're Jonathan Levinson. Oh 
      my<br/>God. My name is Karen and I think<br/>you're... you're wonderful. Oh 
      my god.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Hi Karen. Thank you. Is 
      that my<br/>book...? I could...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KAREN<br/>Yeah. Please. I didn't 
      wanna<br/>bother you... It's Karen with a 'K'.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan signs her COPY OF HIS 
      AUTOBIOGRAPHY, "OH, JONATHAN!" Buffy and Jonathan walk again, leaving 
      Karen looking at the autograph.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KAREN<br/>(called after)<br/>Thank you! 
      So much! Thanks!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>What do you think, Buff? If 
      I'm<br/>wrong, smack me. Karen-with-a-K<br/>will lend you a book and 
      it's<br/>pretty heavy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Maybe I have been blaming 
      him?<br/>How do I get past it? What, what<br/>if it's too late? What if, 
      after<br/>all this, what if he doesn't want<br/>me anymore?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>He does. It may not be 
      easy,<br/>Buffy, but you guys are special<br/>together. That's worth a 
      little<br/>hard work.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But I don't know how to talk 
      to<br/>him. How do I; how do I make it<br/>okay again?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">LOW ANGLE ON: JONATHAN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">From this angle we can see that towering 
      over him is a HUGE BILLBOARD FEATURING A SMILING JONATHAN HOLDING A 
      RUNNING SHOE. Jonathan smiles, mirroring the image.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>If you really want 
      it,<br/>you can make anything happen.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INITIATIVE - NIGHT (DAY 2)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley stands next to GRAHAM among a group of 
      soldiers at a briefing in the Initiative. They stand around a central 
      table and listen to a briefing conducted by the uniformed COLONEL 
      HAVILAND, the no-nonsense new head of The Initiative.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">COLONEL HAVILAND<br/>For those of you 
      who haven't<br/>heard, my name is Colonel George<br/>Haviland. I'm 
      commanding officer<br/>here until such time as the<br/>facility-review is 
      completed.<br/>This review does not mean that our<br/>primary mission has 
      changed in any<br/>way. Recovery of the hostile<br/>known as Adam is our 
      first and<br/>most important job. one to which<br/>I am committing every 
      resource at<br/>my disposal. That means you, men.<br/>So, to this end I've 
      asked our<br/>tactical consultant here to<br/>address us today. Mr. 
      Levinson...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan steps into frame for the first 
      time.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Thank you, 
      Colonel.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He strides to the table and unfurls a large 
      ELECTRONIC DESIGN SCHEMATIC onto it with a clean and efficient 
      gesture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Graham, hushed to Riley:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GRAHAM<br/>About time we brought out the 
      big guns.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Men, before we can locate 
      Adam,<br/>we need to understand him better.<br/>And there's something that 
      has<br/>bothered me almost from the start.<br/>(pause for effect)<br/>He 
      doesn't eat. We have known him<br/>to kill, but never to eat the<br/>kill. 
      So I pulled some of<br/>Professor Walsh's original design<br/>schematics. 
      And I found<br/>something. His power source is<br/>not biological at 
      all.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan points at something on the 
      schematics.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>It's here. The design 
      attempts to<br/>hide it, but I believe it's a<br/>small reservoir of Uranium 
      235.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Sir? How long will it 
      last?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Essentially, forever. It 
      also<br/>means that cutting off his head<br/>is meaningless. Killing Adam 
      is<br/>going to mean annihilating him completely.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Alarmed, the men exchange looks. Jonathan 
      waits to make sure his words have sunk in before he gets to the practical 
      part of his talk:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>But first, we have to find 
      him.<br/>The uranium is encased in lead<br/>sheeting. This'll make it hard 
      to<br/>track Adam even once I've equipped<br/>you all with Geiger counters. 
      But<br/>I think it's our best bet. Let's<br/>talk search quadrants. This is 
      a<br/>well-trained group and I believe<br/>in you. Trust me, we're 
      just<br/>about ready to take this guy by surprise.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. JONATHAN'S HOUSE --NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It's the beautiful home from the teaser. 
      Karen, the autograph-seeking girl, stands outside, training her binoculars 
      through the windows. She lowers them and paces, practicing the 
      following:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KAREN<br/>Hello Jonathan. I don't know 
      if<br/>you remember me-- Hi. Sorry<br/>about coming to your house 
      like<br/>this--. Hello. It's Karen.<br/>Remember me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She raises the binocs again.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KAREN<br/>(frustrated)<br/>Where are you 
      at, anyway?<br/>Are you like, never at home?</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: VIEW THROUGH THE BINOCS</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A magnified view of a window is suddenly 
      obscured -- goes to total black.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KAREN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JUMPS. SHE DROPS the binocs to see a MONSTER 
      standing directly in front of her. She gasps. It is a hunched nightmare, 
      supporting itself on thick forearms that end in claws. It's covered with 
      clumps of thin hair and scabs and acne-like pustules. It also has a 
      distinctive symbol on its forehead. She SCREAMS. The Monster 
      ROARS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KAREN SCREAMS and stumbles back away from 
      the MONSTER. It rears up and smashes Karen with one of its heavy arms. She 
      slides to the ground and it pins her there. Terrified, she hits it with 
      the binoculars and manages to scramble free. It slashes at her with a 
      claw, tearing her shirt and cutting her arm. She runs, almost falls, and 
      finally gets away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. INITIATIVE - NIGHT (DAY 2)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">After the briefing, the troops have 
      dispersed. Riley and Jonathan, left alone, lean against the table, talking

<p>

      Widen to reveal three Initiative soldiers standing some distance away, 
      apples balanced on their heads.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. THE BRONZE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Drums pound. A band plays on stage. Willow 
      and Tara are among the dancing couples. Buffy, Riley, Xander and Anya 
      share a table. Buffy and Riley look ill at ease as Xander and Anya 
      squabble:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>I did not.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Last night. With me. You said

<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Nuh-uh. It was like 
      "aaaah."</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Maybe it was "aaaaanathan," 
      still<br/>not fluffing up the ol' ego.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley leans over toward Buffy, their words 
      unheard by the still-squabbling Xander and Anya. He tries to get a 
      conversation started:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>They're quite a couple, aren't 
      they?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>If it turns into a 
      fistfight,<br/>I've got a fifty on Anya.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I wonder if they'll 
      last.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A little startled, Buffy looks at Riley, 
      wondering the same thing about them. Riley looks away, aware the 
      conversation got away from him. Buffy decides the time has come to have 
      the talk:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Riley... I... 
      think...<br/>(chickening out)<br/>Willow's having a good 
      time.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Uh-huh. I haven't really 
      talked<br/>much to her friend yet.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Tara. She's nice. Kinda 
      shy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Uh-huh.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Just then, the band plays a little fanfare, 
      cutting them off. Buffy and Riley look relieved. Jonathan, wearing a white 
      dinner jacket and holding a highball, steps into the spotlight. The place 
      erupts in applause. Girls crowd around the stage at Jonathan's 
      feet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow and Tara return to the table to 
      watch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan signals to someone offstage who 
      tosses him a mic.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Good evening everyone. This 
      song<br/>is dedicated to some friends of<br/>mine. A very special couple 
      who<br/>have been going through a tough time.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The music swells and Jonathan sings. (An old 
      standard: "More Than You Know" or "The Very Thought of You" or "You Made 
      Me Love You"). Buffy is surprised when Riley stands and offers his hand. 
      She takes it and follows him out onto the dance floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ON THE FLOOR:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she looks at Riley, all sounds fall away 
      except for Jonathan's voice. He opens his arms. She hesitates, then steps 
      into them. They dance. After a while:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Buffy, I want you to 
      know--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Do we have to have the 
      talk?<br/>No talk. More dance.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>I just want to say I'm sorry 
      and<br/>that it's only you that I want--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I know. I know all of 
      that.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>You do? Since 
      when?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Since you put your arms around 
      me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She lays her head on his shoulder and his 
      arms tighten around her. It really is finally okay.</font></p>

      over.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Good thing. Finding new 
      boyfriends<br/>for her is exhausting. I don't know<br/>if I've got another 
      one in me.</font></center>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TARA<br/>(as the band starts up 
      again)<br/>Oh my God. He's gonna do<br/>something off the new 
      album.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The band begins to play a zippy SWING 
      NUMBER. (Something like "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" or "Take the A Train.") 
      Jonathan picks up A TRUMPET and launches into it with smokin' intensity. 
      The crowd goes crazy -- dancers are swinging and Jonathan's horn is 
      wailing...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON ANYA:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Her eyes are locked on Jonathan. Without 
      moving:</font></p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER (O.S.)<br/>Yeah?</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Let's go have sex 
      now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WIDEN TO REVEAL: XANDER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He is similarly transfixed.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Yeah. Okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The two of them head for the door, still 
      looking at Jonathan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They have just left when KAREN bursts into 
      the room, her arm bloodied, her shirt torn, tears streaming down her face. 
      She stumbles toward the stage, bumping into some patrons, including Buffy. 
      Buffy reaches out, tries to stop her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What happened to you? Can I 
      help?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Karen pushes past Buffy, her eyes fixed 
      on Jonathan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan waves the band to silence. The room 
      falls quiet except for Karen's sobs. Jonathan jumps down from the stage. 
      He takes her hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(gently)<br/>Karen? That's 
      your name isn't it?<br/>I signed my book for you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks at him with blank, hopeless 
      eyes.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Tell me what hurt you, 
      Karen.<br/>I can help.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. JONATHAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, Riley approach the place by 
      Jonathan's house where Karen was attacked. Jonathan (still wearing his 
      dinner jacket, but his bow tie is untied) trails behind, his arm around 
      the still-shaking Karen. Four COPS are there when Buffy and Riley step 
      up.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(to a cop)<br/>What's going on? 
      Why are you here?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan and Karen arrive. The Sergeant 
      ignores Buffy, turns to Jonathan.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SERGEANT<br/>Mr. Levinson. Someone on 
      your<br/>staff reported a disturbance.<br/>When I realized it was your 
      house<br/>I thought I'd better come down in person...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>That's all right, 
      Sergeant.<br/>I have it under control.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan starts examining the trampled 
      ground where the broken binoculars still lie.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SERGEANT<br/>Of course sir. Glad to 
      see<br/>you're all right, sir.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As the cops exit, Buffy picks up the 
      binoculars.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>There's something on 
      these.<br/>Maybe she hurt it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I saw that. I'm 
      afraid<br/>it's just condensation.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(embarrassed)<br/>Oh. It 
      doesn't seem like-- yeah, sorry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan goes to Karen and puts a gentle 
      hand on her arm.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Karen, I know you're 
      scared, but<br/>I need to hear your description again.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KAREN<br/>It was ugly. Big ugly. All 
      bent<br/>over sort of, with these huge<br/>arms, and, and, like scabs and 
      stuff.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>That must have been 
      very<br/>frightening. I'm so sorry you--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KAREN<br/>Oh! I forgot! It had a 
      mark.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>A mark?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KAREN<br/>On its forehead. Like a 
      symbol.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Riley takes a pen and small notebook from 
      his pocket and hands it to Karen. She draws the mark. Jonathan looks at 
      it. And for the first time, we see Jonathan react with anything other than 
      perfect cool. He blinks and hesitates.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Well. This is a 
      clue.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy notices the hesitation.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Jonathan?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan seems to recover, snapping back to 
      his "normal" self. He folds up the sketch, tucks it into his 
      pocket.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I've heard of this. Not a 
      demon,<br/>just a monster. Not much more<br/>than an animal. Sticks to 
      the<br/>woods, doesn't come near populated areas.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But it did this time. It 
      might<br/>again. We should probably patrol.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>If you want me to mobilize a 
      squad --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Actually, I think Karen 
      simply startled it --<br/>(to Karen, comforting)<br/>Probably more afraid of 
      you than you were of it.<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>I'll patrol, but you don't have 
      to worry about it.<br/>I can handle it on my own. Now, let's see 
      about<br/>getting Karen a ride home...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">His voice grows more distant as we move 
      to:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: EDGE OF THE SCENE</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Someone leans casually against a tree, 
      watching the entire scene from the shadows. He's named JAPE, and he's a 
      vampire, but we don't know that yet, because he's not in vamp-face right 
      now. He smirks at the proceedings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">To establish. One light burns deep inside 
      the building.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A dead and eviscerated LIBRARIAN lies on the 
      tile floor. Flies are heard buzzing faintly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Adam sits nearby at a table. He has 
      surrounded himself with a media feast: open books are piled in front of 
      him and three computer monitors flicker in front of him, displaying data 
      and pictures. He absorbs all the information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">PICTURES OF JONATHAN DOMINATE THE MONITORS: 
      JONATHAN ACCEPTING AWARDS, CHATTING ON A TALK SHOW, etc. Jape steps into 
      frame behind Adam. Now he's in VAMP-FACE.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JAPE<br/>Wish you'd get rid of that 
      body.<br/>The smell's making me hungry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>You wouldn't want it. It had 
      a<br/>blood disease. It didn't know,<br/>but it would've been dead 
      within<br/>the year. Humans sense so little<br/>of what they carry 
      inside.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JAPE<br/>Huh. Hey, guess what? 
      There's<br/>something new in town. Attacked<br/>a girl. Caused a little 
      fuss.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jape looks at the monitors, sees the images 
      of Jonathan.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JAPE<br/>He was there. 
      Jonathan.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Adam looks directly at Jape, interested for 
      the first time.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>Jonathan. Tell me. Who is 
      he?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JAPE<br/>You're joking, right? Jonathan 
      is Jonathan.<br/>(points at the monitors)<br/>Look.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>These are lies.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Adam hits a switch and the monitors 
      die.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>None of this is real. The 
      world<br/>has been changed. It's intriguing,<br/>but it's 
      wrong.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JAPE<br/>Feels okay to 
      me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Adam looks away again, no longer interested 
      in Jape. He picks up a book.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>You are under his spell like 
      the others.<br/>I seem to be the only one who's not.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JAPE<br/>Yeah? What makes you so 
      special?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Adam answers, but it's more like he's 
      talking to himself:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>I'm aware. I know every 
      molecule<br/>of myself and everything around<br/>me. No one -- no human, no 
      demon<br/>has ever been as awake and alive<br/>as I am. You're all 
      shadows.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jape's a little creeped out by 
      that.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JAPE<br/>Oh. So what do you do now? 
      You<br/>could kill Jonathan. Or you could<br/>try, I mean, the guy's a 
      dynamo of action.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ADAM<br/>I don't need to do 
      anything.<br/>These majiks are unstable,<br/>corrosive. They will 
      inevitably<br/>lead to chaos. And I'm interested in chaos.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan, wearing an expensive silk robe, 
      stands at his marble mantelpiece and stares into a roaring fire. A lovely 
      Swedish woman, INGA, appears on a balcony that overhangs the room. She's 
      wearing a negligee and she calls down to him:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INGA<br/>Jonathan! Aren't you coming to 
      bed?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Another woman enters frame. Inga's identical 
      twin ILSA, wearing identical revealing nightwear. She stops brushing her 
      hair and also calls out:</font></p>

      late.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I'll be right 
      there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan slips off his silk robe and heads 
      toward the bedroom. ON THE BACK OF HIS LEFT SHOULDER WE SEE THE SAME MARK

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Jonathan did. Said it's some

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh. Cool.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I guess. It was a little...

      scared.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Um, Buffy, this is Jonathan. 
      You<br/>know he doesn't get scared. You<br/>talked about it when you gave 
      him<br/>the Class Protector Award at the Prom.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Right.</font></center>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Tara starts to walk away. As she goes, 
      Willow puts a hand on Tara's shoulder, lets it drift down Tara's arm, 
      gives her hand a warm squeeze before they part. Willow and Buffy walk 
      on.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>So. I saw you and Riley, with

      walks faster.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But she's misjudged the direction of the 
      danger. The Monster steps out from around a corner in front of her and she 
      finds herself face-to-face with it. It reaches out with one of its massive 
      forearms and swats her to the ground, face-down. It pummels her with its 
      arms, tearing at her with its claws.</font></p>

      bruised, she half-crawls, half-runs for the commons, making it there just 
      in time to see a JANITOR DISAPPEAR UP THE STAIRS, TURNING OUT THE LIGHTS 
      AS HE GOES. She starts to yell, but the Monster knocks her to the floor

      3)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy walks and thinks. She doesn't even 
      look at the posters and the marquee of the Sun Cinema, which is showing 
      "BEING JONATHAN LEVINSON." She doesn't look at the health food store with 
      its display of "JONATHAN-SHAPED CHEWABLE VITAMINS". She doesn't look at 
      the two kids sitting on a bench outside the store playing with their 
      JONATHAN ACTION FIGURES.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">KID<br/>I crush you with my 
      super-Jonathan blaster!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then,</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">TIGHT ON BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she walks along one of those rough wood 
      walls that surround construction sites. Behind her we get glimpses of 
      posters. DEEP IN THOUGHT, Buffy passes by them. She walks slower. Then 
      stops.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CUT-WIDER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy is small at the leading edge of the 
      frame now and we see the whole wall. Identical posters stretch out behind 
      her -- all the ones she's already passed by. Each one shows JONATHAN'S 
      FACE AND THE WORDS "JONATHAN.COM." She turns and looks back at them, lets 
      herself really see them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. XANDER'S BASEMENT - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy faces Anya across the doorway at the 
      base of the outside stairs.</font></p>

      here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They stand there for a beat.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>You're not going away.<br/>Why 
      aren't you going away?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well, I kind of wanted to look 
      at<br/>some of Xander's stuff...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Oh.<br/>(practiced and 
      flat)<br/>Please come in, make yourself<br/>at home. And so 
      on.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy enters. Anya flops down on the sofa, 
      picks up her copy of "Oh, Jonathan!" and reads, mouthing the words softly 
      to herself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy wanders around the room, looking at 
      Xander's collection of Jonathanabilia: JONATHAN COLLECTABLE CARDS. A 
      JONATHAN MUSIC-CD. A JONATHAN COMIC BOOK IN A PLASTIC SLEEVE - we glimpse 
      the title "TARGET: JONATHAN."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy crosses to the sofa, and sits down 
      with Anya.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Oh, you're still here. 
      Um...<br/>that's nice.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Can I ask you something? Does 
      it<br/>ever seem, I don't know, weird to<br/>you that Jonathan is so good at 
      everything?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>He's Jonathan.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She goes back to her book. Buffy takes the

      where<br/>he invents the internet!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Anya, he fights better than I 
      do.<br/>And I'm the Slayer. The Slayer --<br/>that's supposed to mean 
      something, right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Oh. Um buck up, you. You 
      kill<br/>the best. Go you. Kill kill.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Actually, not needing 
      the<br/>validation. But, thanks. It's<br/>just... he's too perfect 
      and...<br/>I don't know...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">A beat.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>So I can have my book 
      back--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Anya, when you were a 
      demon,<br/>you granted wishes, right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Vengeance wishes on

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But someone could wish the 
      whole<br/>world to be different? That's possible?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Sure. Alternate realities. 
      You<br/>could have, like, a world without<br/>shrimp. Or with, you 
      know,<br/>nothing but shrimp. You could<br/>even make a freaky world 
      where<br/>Jonathan's some kind of not-<br/>perfect mouth-breather if 
      that's<br/>what's blowing your skirt up tonight.<br/>Just don't ask me to 
      live there.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Now. If you'll just give me 
      back<br/>my book you can be on your way<br/>somewhere else.</font></center>
<p></p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I'm just saying it doesn't

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Yeah. When is Jonathan gonna

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>This is the 
      meeting.</font></center>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Buffy has something to 
      say.<br/>Let's hear what it is. Go ahead.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Well, I wanted to kind of... 
      see<br/>if anyone else thinks Jonathan's,<br/>kind of, too 
      perfect.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>No. He's not. He's just 
      perfect<br/>enough. He crushed the bones of<br/>the Master, he blew up a big 
      snake<br/>made out of Mayor, and he coached<br/>the U.S. Women's Soccer Team 
      to a<br/>stunning World Cup victory. We<br/>saw him doing those 
      things!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>But see, I'm not sure we can 
      trust<br/>our memories. Anya, tell them<br/>about the alternate 
      universes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Oh. Okay, well, say you 
      really<br/>liked shrimp a lot. Or, we could<br/>say that you didn't like 
      shrimp at<br/>all. "Blah, I wish there weren't<br/>any shrimp," you say to 
      yourself--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No, no. She's not saying 
      it<br/>right. I just think he did<br/>something so he's manipulating 
      the<br/>world, and we're all, you know, like pawns.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>(amusing herself)<br/>Or

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Yes, of course, I just -- I

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(hurt)<br/>But, I'm not 
      --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>It sounds like

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy deflates -- the last

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>But I'm starting to know this

      I<br/>think -- for once -- we should<br/>follow her lead.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She looks at him, moved. Then:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay. The other day, I think 
      I<br/>saw him ignore evidence. I think<br/>he let Tara get 
      hurt.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>On purpose?</font></center>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No, no...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>(concerned)<br/>How did he

<p></p>
<p>

      it.<br/>Jonathan saw it and he kind of... blinked.</font></center>
<p></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>He blinked. The man moistens 
      his<br/>eyeballs and we're having a meeting about it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>He knew something about that 
      Monster.<br/>He was reacting to the mark-- Wait.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They wait a long beat as she thinks. Then 
      another. Finally:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>How long do we usually wait for 
      these things?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I remember something. Giles, 
      do<br/>you have a Jonathan Swimsuit Calendar?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>No.<br/>(a 
      beat)<br/>Yes.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He opens a drawer, pulls out the Jonathan 
      Swimsuit Calendar.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>It was a gift.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy pages through it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(quickly)<br/>No. No. Wow. No. 
      There!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She stops on a revealing photograph of 
      Jonathan in which part of the mark on his shoulder is visible. Willow 
      gasps.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Yeah. Pretty darn

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>The other kind of oh. That's 
      it.<br/>That's what Tara drew.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Why would Jonathan have the

<p></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN (O.S.)<br/>Is this a private 
      conversation?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They all turn. Jonathan stands casually near 
      the door...</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Or can Mister July sit 
      in?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(caught)<br/>Jonathan!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>Hi. Buffy was just saying how 
      you<br/>had a Monster cut up Willow's friend.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Buffy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No. It's just, the mark. 
      You<br/>said it was safe and it wasn't.<br/>(backing off)<br/>I'm sorry. I 
      just don't understand.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Then I'll explain. Buffy is 
      right.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">General disbelief.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>No!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I do have a history with 
      the<br/>creature, the Monster. The<br/>problem is, every time I face 
      it,<br/>my mind becomes, sort of,<br/>confused. There's some kind 
      of<br/>power it possesses.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Oh! Oh! He's your 
      Kryptonite!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan smiles sadly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Maybe. I just know it takes 
      all<br/>my energy to try to fight the<br/>confusion. That's why I had 
      his<br/>mark tattooed on me. So I<br/>wouldn't underestimate him 
      next<br/>time. But it didn't work, and<br/>people got hurt. It's 
      terrible.<br/>But I swear to you all, it wasn't malicious.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>This does explain 
      everything.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I knew he wouldn't do 
      anything on purpose.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Me too. And that whole 
      alternate<br/>universe thing was just freaky.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The camera stays close on Buffy thinking as 
      the conversation continues. She's still troubled.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Jonathan. Let's go after 
      the<br/>Monster right now. You and me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan starts to look a little 
      strained.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I'm sure it's left town by 
      now.<br/>That's been its pattern.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>We can try.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>(forced)<br/>Sure. Let's do 
      that.</font></center>

      the<br/>little sidekick out for a walk, are we?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

Spike.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Ooh. Semi-harsh language 
      from<br/>Betty. You're feisty when the big<br/>guy's standing beside 
      you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike runs a finger down the side of Buffy's 
      face, then runs it caressingly across her throat.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Someday, Sweet Slayer, I'd 
      love to<br/>take you on. See you face the<br/>evil alone for 
      once.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan SLAPS Spike's hand away from Buffy 
      roughly, then PUSHES SPIKE up against the crypt wall. Spike twists, 
      helpless against Jonathan's strength.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Every demon in this town 
      is<br/>gunning for you right now. So I<br/>figure you're probably

      you seen it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>No. But then again, I'm

      out of him.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy considers that for a moment. Then SHE 
      grabs Spike and throws him up against the wall and holds him 
      there.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Ow! What are you doing? 
      You<br/>aren't supposed to do that.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy leans in close, speaks softly, 
      intimately.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Spike, you're relying on

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>What are you 
      saying?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Just that the butchers in 
      this<br/>town respect Jonathan's<br/>reputation. If they do him a<br/>favor 
      you might get pretty thirsty.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Look, I don't know much, 
      okay?<br/>There's some vampires got kicked<br/>out of a cave in the hills 
      behind<br/>Brookside park. Don't know what<br/>did the kicking out, but it 
      was<br/>prob'ly pretty big--</font></center>

      Augmentation spell.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(embarrassed)<br/>What... um... 
      what did he have... augmented?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Him. And how we see him. 
      This<br/>spell turns the sorcerer into a,<br/>into a sort of paragon. The

      drawback.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>A drawback?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>In order to balance the new 
      force<br/>of good, the spell has to create<br/>the opposing force of evil. 
      The<br/>worst of everything. Everyone's nightmare.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANYA<br/>He created the

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>So we're saying he did a

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>That is so

<p>

      are<br/>going after this nightmare thing.<br/>Are they going to be 
      okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Well, it seems that the 
      well-being<br/>of this creature is linked to<br/>Jonathan. If it dies, the 
      spell<br/>is broken and Jonathan reverts to<br/>whatever he was 
      before.</font></center>
<p></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and Jonathan enter a drippy creepy 
      cave. They make their way slowly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">They walk cautiously to the edge of a deep

      that to happen.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">It would be easy to push Buffy over. He 
      reaches for her. His hand closes around her wrist. And he... pulls her 
      gently back away from the edge.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Well, actually, it should be 
      more<br/>or less the same, except that<br/>Jonathan won't be Jonathan. 
      Not<br/>our Jonathan, anyway.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>No. No. No. No. World 
      without<br/>sunshine! World without joy!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>But, wait. It only changes 
      back<br/>if Buffy kills this thing, right?<br/>I mean, if she loses, we 
      could be<br/>stuck in this... wrong world forever.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Things looking up. I mean,

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As we left things. Jonathan lies unconscious 
      on the cave floor. Buffy stands alone against the Monster. (NOTE: THE 
      CRUCIAL DYNAMIC OF THIS FIGHT IS THAT JONATHAN IS A STRONG FIGHTER EVERY 
      TIME THE MONSTER IS WINNING. JONATHAN IS WEAK<br/>AND SCARED EVERY TIME THE 
      MONSTER IS LOSING.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: JONATHAN</font></p>

      at:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: BUFFY AND THE MONSTER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy kicks the Monster -- not hard enough. 
      It doesn't budge. Instead, the Monster catches Buffy with a heavy clawed 
      arm and she falls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: JONATHAN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Invigorated by the Monster's momentary 
      advantage, Jonathan flips up to his feet and helps Buffy to her 
      feet.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(relieved)<br/>Jonathan! What 
      do we do?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I think you're gonna have 
      to<br/>handle this one solo.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What? But I -- 
      how?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>You'll know. You used to. 
      And<br/>the more you hurt it, the more<br/>I'll lose my --</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Monster charges Buffy. Buffy sweeps its 
      feet from under it with a kick and it falls.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What? Lose your 
      what?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: JONATHAN YELPS AND RUNS 
      AWAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He's sweaty and freaked out and even his 
      CLOTHES seem rumpled and ill-fitting. This guy has lost his 
      cool.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Oh.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: THE MONSTER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Back on its feet, looking strong. It 
      ROARS!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: JONATHAN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Stops running and turns around -- the 
      Monster's strength gives him strength. Tailored and suave, he breaks a 
      stalactite off the ceiling, brandishes it like a sword and leaps back into 
      the fight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He strikes the Monster with it. The Monster 
      is driven back. Triggered by the Monster's weakness, Jonathan yelps and 
      drops the stalactite, then trips over it as he tries to run 
      away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She takes advantage of the Monster's current 
      state. She moves in, hitting it with a flurry of punches, fighting with 
      increasing confidence and style.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I remember this. This is 
      good.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Monster fights back, hitting her 
      hard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: JONATHAN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Leaps to his feet... charges into the fight 
      once more!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">vaults over a stalagmite, slamming into the 
      Monster and driving it back almost to the lip of the chasm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: JONATHAN</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Runs screaming from the fight again. 
      Trembling and scared, he hugs himself, huddled against the wall of the 
      cave.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: THE MONSTER</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Lands a slashing blow that catches Buffy 
      across the shoulder and throws her to the ground. SHE'S DANGLING ON THE 
      EDGE OF THE CHASM, ONE ARM HANGING INTO THE VOID. The Monster presses down 
      on her head with one massive clawed arm... threatening to crush her 
      skull.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WIDER SHOT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Suddenly, JONATHAN GETS TO HIS FEET... AND 
      LAUNCHES HIMSELF INTO A HUGE FLYING TACKLE. HE HITS THE 
MONSTER.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Jonathan and the Monster are both carried 
      over the edge, falling into the chasm.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">ANGLE: BUFFY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">lying on the edge, just manages to catch the 
      hem of Jonathan's pants-leg between her fingers moments before we hear the 
      bone-splintering crunch of the Monster hitting the bottom of the 
      pit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT STREET, BILLBOARD - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With a magical WHOOSH, and a sweeping tide 
      of ELECTRICAL BLUE LIGHT, the world reverts to the Sunnydale we know. The 
      billboard is swept by the line of blue fire. Now instead of Jonathan, a 
      smiling woman holds the shoe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET, SUN CINEMA - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The BLUE LIGHT sweeps the marquee. "SNOW 
      FALLING ON JONATHAN" becomes "CLOSED FOR REPAIRS."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. STREET, WALL OF POSTERS - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The BLUE LIGHT races along the wall of 
      posters. The endless row of Jonathan faces becomes an endless row of 
      posters advertising "Dingoes Ate My Baby."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. CAMPUS - DAY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, Xander, Anya, Willow, Riley and Tara 
      sit at the base of a tree on campus. Tara is still bruised, but looks 
      otherwise recovered.</font></p>

      it.</font></center>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Well, the swimsuit 
      calendar's<br/>sticking in my mind.<br/>(off Buffy's look)<br/>Not in a good 
      way.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>I'll always remember the way 
      he<br/>made me feel about me. Valued and<br/>respected. Sort of tingly. 
      And<br/>now I'm just... empty.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Poor Xander, I guess he hurt

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>Did anyone else feel way too 
      tall?<br/>I felt way too tall...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As the others continue to talk, Buffy sees 
      Jonathan standing a little distance away, loitering, trying to catch her 
      eye. She crosses to him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>I, I wasn't sure you'd come 
      over.<br/>Everyone's mostly forgetting, but<br/>I think some people are 
      kinda angry.</font></center>

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>Nobody's even talking to

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Why'd you do it anyway? No, I 
      get<br/>why. How did you do it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JONATHAN<br/>After the... thing... with 
      the<br/>bell tower and the gun? I went to<br/>counselling. Other kids 
      with<br/>problems. One of 'em had this<br/>spell. He glossed right over 
      the<br/>Monster. Well, anyway. I just...<br/>I just wanted to apologize. 
      No<br/>one was supposed to get hurt.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Jonathan, you get why they're 
      mad,<br/>right? Not just the Monster.<br/>People didn't like being, 
      you<br/>know, the actors in your little<br/>sock puppet 
      theater.</font></center>

      that<br/>I don't really remember, I think<br/>it was right. I think it
