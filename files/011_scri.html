<p>EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING 
      <p>Students arriving. It's another fine day on the Hellmouth. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA (V.O.)<br/>I just love springtime...</center>
<p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>The walls are covered with signs for the "Spring Fling," the sophomore 
      dance to be held at the Bronze. Standing by a sign reminding, "Cast Your 
      vote on Thursday for May Queen!" are CORDELIA, HARMONY and hunk-du-jour, 
      MITCH FARGO. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Me in bright spring fashions... 
      <p>MITCH<br/>Spring training... 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Me at the end-of-school dance... 
      <p>HARMONY <br/>The end of school... 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Definitely my favorite time of <br/>year!</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>INT. HALLWAY LEADING TO THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>as they near the Library, walking and talking through the flow of 
      students. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>... I am, of course, having my<br/>dress specially 
      made. Off-the-rack<br/>gives me hives. 
      <p>MITCH<br/>Let me guess. Blue, like your<br/>eyes. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>My eyes are hazel, Helen Keller. 
      <p>HARMONY<br/>You two will look so fine together<br/>in the May Queen 
      photo. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(immense false modesty)<br/>Well, technically, I haven't 
      been<br/>elected May Queen yet.</p></p></p></p></center>
<p>A beat as they look at each other, then they all laugh. 
      <p>Just then Buffy bursts out the Library doors, SLAMMING into Cordelia 
      and Mitch. Her backpack spills -- books, papers... and medieval weaponry. 
      Several students stop to rubberneck the "accident." Everyone stares at the 
      weaponry. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Behold the weirdness.</center>
<p>Buffy quickly starts stashing the arsenal back in the pack. 
      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>You're probably wondering what I'm <br/>doing with this 
      stuff. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>Wow, I'm <b>not</b>. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>It's actually... show-and-tell!<br/>For history class. Mr. 
      Giles has<br/>this, like, hobby. A hobby of<br/>collecting stuff. Which he 
      lent<br/>me. For show-and-tell. Did I<br/>mention it's for history 
      class?</p></p></center>
<p>Students in the crowd stare at her, silent. 
      <p>
<center>HARMONY<br/>She is always hanging with the <br/>creepy librarian in 
      that creepy<br/>library. 
      <p>MITCH<br/>Ew, libraries. All those books.<br/>What's up with 
      that?</p></center>
<p>With a few chuckles, the crowd disperses. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>(to Mitch as they leave)<br/>Did I ever tell you about 
      when<br/>Buffy <b>attacked me</b>? With a <b>spear</b><br/>when I came out 
      of the ladies' at<br/>the Bronze. I still re-live the<br/>trauma every time 
      I see a pencil.<br/>I can only use felt-tip now...</center>
<p>Still on her knees, Buffy watches them go, hurt. 
      <p>
<center>TEACHER'S VOICE (V.O.)<br/>If you prick us, do we not 
      bleed?</center>
<p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. ENGLISH CLASSROOM - MINUTES LATER 
      <p>The teacher is MS. MILLER. She gamely tries to unlock the mysteries of 
      Shakespeare for XANDER, WILLOW, Harmony, Cordelia and others. She reads 
      with great enthusiasm - 
      <p>
<center>MS. MILLER<br/>"If you tickle us, do we not laugh?<br/>If you poison 
      us, do we not die?<br/>And if you wrong us, shall we 
      not<br/>revenge?"<br/>(beat)<br/>OK, so talk to me, people. How<br/>does what 
      Shylock says here, about<br/>being a Jew, relate to our<br/>discussion about 
      the anger of<br/>the outcast at society?</center>
<p>Cordelia's hand shoots up like a rocket. Willow also raises her hand. 
      But Cordelia waves hers insistently and Ms. Miller points at her. Willow 
      lowers her hand, disappointed. 
      <p>
<center>MS. MILLER<br/>Cordelia, what's Shylock saying? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>How about, "color me totally<br/>self-involved". 
      <p>MS. MILLER<br/>Care to elaborate? 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>With Shylock it's whine, whine,<br/>whine, like the whole 
      world is<br/>about him! He acts like it's<br/>justice, him getting a pound 
      of <br/>Antonio's flesh. It's not justice,<br/>it's yicky. 
      <p>MS. MILLER<br/>But has Shylock suffered? What's<br/>his place in Venice 
      Society? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Well, everyone looks down on him -- 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>That's such a twinkie defense!<br/>Shylock should get over 
      himself.<br/>People who think their problems are<br/>so huge craze me. Like 
      the time I<br/>sort of ran over this girl on her<br/>bike, and it was the 
      most<br/>traumatizing even of my <b>life</b>,<br/>and she's trying to make 
      it al<br/>about <b>her</b> leg! Like my pain<br/>meant <b>nothing</b>!... 
      <p>MS. MILLER<br/>Cordelia's raised an interesting <br/>point here 
      --<br/>(the BELL RINGS)<br/>Which we will pursue next time.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></center>
<p>The students start out. Cordelia approaches Ms. Miller. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Ms. Miller? 
      <p>MS. MILLER<br/>Some good observations today,<br/>Cordelia. Always 
      exciting to know<br/>someone's actually done the <br/>reading.</p></center>
<p>Willow, the last out, scowls a bit at this. SHE did the reading... 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>I wanted to talk to you about my<br/>final paper. I'm 
      real unfocused.<br/>I have all these points, and I'm <br/>pretty sure they 
      all contradict<br/>each other. 
      <p>MS. MILLER<br/>I have your outline here<br/>somewhere... Why don't you 
      stop in<br/>after school tomorrow, we can go<br/>over it. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>That's great, thanks.</p></p></center>
<p>ANGLE: THROUGH THE CLASSROOM WINDOW 
      <p>We are in the hall, in someone's POV. As Cordelia heads for the door, 
      Ms. Miller says: 
      <p>
<center>MS. MILLER<br/>I'll see you then.</center>
<p>And the POV suddenly whips around, looking down the hall. We see Willow 
      just exciting, with Xander. The POV moves back suddenly as Cordelia comes 
      out the door. Not noticing whoever it is, she starts down the hall 
      herself, away from camera. 
      <p>
<div align="right">CUT TO:</div>
<p>INT. BOYS' LOCKER ROOM - MINUTES LATER 
      <p>Baseball gear lies scattered about as Mitch pulls on his pants. Two 
      BUDS pass by on their way out. 
      <p>
<center>BUD #1<br/>You going to the Bronze? 
      <p>MITCH<br/>Later. I'm picking out my tux<br/>first. Got to look sharp for 
      the<br/>big 'dig. 
      <p>BUD #1<br/>That's right. Gotta look good to<br/>be on Cordelia's arm. 
      <p>MITCH<br/>It's not her arm I'm looking to be<br/>on.</p></p></p></center>
<p>ANGLE: THE SPOOKY POV - AMONG THE LOCKERS 
      <p>Somewhere near the back, watching as the two Buds wave goodbye. There's 
      something rather ballsy about the POV -- whoever it is doesn't seem too 
      concerned with concealment. The Buds pass right by without taking notice 
      as they exit. 
      <p>ANGLE: MITCH AT HIS LOCKER 
      <p>He pulls on his shirt. 
      <p>SPOOKEY POV 
      <p>Stalks through the lockers, toward Mitch... 
      <p>BACK TO MITCH 
      <p>He hears a GIGGLE. It's eerie. 
      <p>
<center>MITCH<br/>Who's there?</center>
<p>No response. No movement. Nothing. Mitch reaches for his jacket when he 
      hears the GIGGLE again -- low, maniacal. 
      <p>
<center>MITCH<br/>Okay, fun time's over. Come out!</center>
<p>Still nothing there. But that doesn't console Mitch. Slowly he reaches 
      for a baseball bat nearby... 
      <p>Suddenly <b>the baseball bat rises into the air on its own and WHACKS 
      Mitch</b>! 
      <p>Mitch stumbles against the lockers. He looks up to see: 
      <p>ANGLE: MITCH'S POV 
      <p>The bat is floating in midair. Pulls back to swing -- 
      <p>He ducks, and the bat SLAMS into metal. Mitch scrambles away, dazed 
      from the hit, and the bat tags him again, sending him to the ground. 
      <p>The last thing we see is the end of the bat raise up and slam down out 
      of the frame.

      <p>Buffy is by herself, putting her books away as Cordelia saunters down 
      the hall handing out little chocolates. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>(handing a chocolate to a<br/>student)<br/>Remember who 
      to vote for for May <br/>Queen. As in, me.</center>
<p>She reaches Harmony, shows her a chocolate. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Isnít this the BOMB? Iím SUCH the<br/>campaign

      <p>BUFFY<br/>At my old school. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So, the good kind of moron would do<br/>that. The non-moron, I

      <p>BUFFY<br/>I mean, we didnít call it May<br/>Queen, but we had the dance,

<p>Willow suddenly bursts into hysteric laughter again.

<p>Xander joins Willow in laughing. Buffy looks off, lost in thought. 
      Sees:

      <p>
<center>BUFFY<br/>Mitch, what happened? 
      <p>MITCH<br/>I donít know... I heard something,<br/>I tried to grab a bat... 
      and it hit<br/>me. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>What hit you?

      <p>MR. SNYDER<br/>I donít think Mitch needs his comb<br/>right now. I think

<p>Xander and Willow have been witnessing this exchange. They walk past

<p>Buffy sneaks around them and into -- 
      <p>INT. THE BOYSí LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
      <p>Itís empty. Buffy goes toward the lockers, sees the VICIOUS DENTS on 
      the locker doors. She stops, looks down. 
      <p>ANGLE: THE BAT 
      <p>is on the floor. There is blood on it. Buffy hesitantly nudges it with 
      her foot. It rolls innocently. 
      <p>Nearby, four lockers in a row are open. The last is Mitchís. Curious, 
      Buffy crosses to it. Looks inside. Thereís nothing of interest and she 
      closes it. 
      <p>Thereís an ďKĒ spray-painted on it in red. She looks at is, puzzled, 
      then looks at the three adjacent doors. Slowly, she shuts them all. 
      <p>They spell out, LOOK.

      on that one. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Well, assuming the bat itself is<br/>not possessed, there are a 
      few<br/>possibilities that bear<br/>investigating. Someone 
      with<br/>telekinesis, the power to move<br/>objects at will... some 
      invisible<br/>creature... or possibly a<br/>poltergeist. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>A ghost? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes. An angry one. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Angry is right. It was a real<br/>scene in that locker room. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>So, if itís a ghost, then weíre<br/>talking about a dead kid? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>I suppose so. Willow, why donít <br/>you compile a list of kids 
      whoíve<br/>died here who might have turned<br/>into ghosts. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Weíre on a Hellmouth. Itís gonna<br/>be a long list.

<center>WILLOW<br/>Dead kids. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Yikes. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>I was gonna pull up ďmissingĒ too,<br/>but I didnít have 
      enough time. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Whatís the word on Harmony? 
      <p>GILES<br/>I believe it was a compound<br/>fracture. Not wonderful fun. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>This is a fairly testy ghost weíve <br/>got. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Maybe. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>You think ďTestyĒ is too strong a<br/>word? ĎCause I felt I 
      was<br/>understating -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Giles, have you ever touched a <br/>ghost? 
      <p>GILES<br/>No I havenít. Iíve seen one, in<br/>Dartmoor. A murdered 
      countess,<br/>very beautiful. She used to float<br/>along the foothills, 
      moaning the<br/>most piteous -- Iíve gone away<br/>again, havenít I? 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>Itís funny when he does that. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>We were talking about touching. 
      <p>GILES<br/>Yes. Well, from what Iíve read,<br/>having a ghost pass through 
      you is<br/>a singular experience. Itís a<br/>cold, amorphous feeling, makes 
      your<br/>hair stand up. 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Okay, this is my problem. I<br/>touched the thing. It didnít 
      go<br/>through me, it bumped into me. And<br/>it wasnít cold. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>So that means, what -- that weíre<br/>talking about an 
      invisible person? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>A girl. She spoke. She said Harmony<br/>deserved what she got. 
      <p>GILES<br/>A girl on campus with the power to<br/>turn invisible. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Man, that is so cool.

      <p>XANDER<br/>Iíd give anything to be able to <br/>turn invisible.<br/>(off

      <p>GILES<br/>It probably is having an awfully heady <br/>experience, having 
      that ability. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>So howíd she get it? Is she a<br/>witch? ĎCause we can fight 
      a<br/>witch. 
      <p>XANDER<br/>Greek myths talk about cloaks of<br/>invisibility, but theyíre 
      usually<br/>just for the gods.<br/>(off their looks)<br/>Research boy comes

      <p>BUFFY<br/>This girlís sort of petty, for a<br/>God.

      <p>XANDER<br/>Harmony and Mitch. And the common<br/>denominator there -- 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>Is Cordelia. 
      <p>WILLOW<br/>So what now? 
      <p>BUFFY<br/>First thing tomorrow, pull up that<br/>missing kids list. Maybe 
      this<br/>girlís made herself invisible for<br/>long enough for someone to 
      notice<br/>sheís gone.

      <p>ANGEL<br/>I know youíve been researching the<br/>Master. 
      <p>GILES<br/>The Vampire King. Yes, Iím trying <br/>to learn all I can about 
      him. For<br/>the day when Buffy must face him.<br/>I havenít learned much,

      donít know<br/>what. Youíve read all the Slayer<br/>lore there is, right? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Iíve studied all the extant<br/>volumes, of course. But the 
      most<br/>important books of Slayer prophecy<br/>have been lost. The 
      Tiberius<br/>Manifesto, the Pergamum Codex.

      <p>ANGEL<br/>Not lost. Misplaced. I can get<br/>it. 
      <p>GILES<br/>That would be very helpful. <br/>(holding up a book)<br/>My own

      <p>Buffy emerges into the larger space on the opposite side from where she 
      came in through the Band Room ceiling. She sees the rope, the leather 
      satchel, Cordeliaís unconscious body dressed for May Queen.

      <p>The satchel drops to the ground with a thud. We HEAR Marcie drop next 
      to it, then the bag opens. 
      <p>Buffy tries to prop herself up, still dazed, when she sees:

      <p>ANGLE: BUFFYíS POV 
      <p>Cordelia, sitting tied to a chair with Marcieís thick nylon rope. 
      Actually itís a throne -- they are onstage at the bronze. 
      <p>Buffy tries to get up and realizes that she too is tied -- to the other 
      throne. She struggles a bit but the bonds are tight, strong. Giving up, 
      she looks in front of her for the first time. 
      <p>ANGLE: CORDELIA 
      <p>is already awake, and staring ahead of her as well. She glances over at

      <p>For the first time, we see the full tableau: two thrones, facing away

      shutoff valve. The HISSING subsides slightly. He staggers to Willow, 
      choking. Xander follows suit. 
      <p>
<center>GILES<br/>That should give us a few minutes,<br/>but if we cannot

      <p>
<center>MARCIEíS VOICE<br/>Iím disappointed. I really hoped<br/>you would

      <p>MARCIEíS VOICE<br/>No, you donít get it. Youíre not<br/>the student. 
      Youíre the lesson.</p></p></p></center>
<p>Neither of the girls is real excited to hear that. The cart stops 
      between them, both girls looking at it. Cordeliaís voice has a new level 
      of hesitance in it as she says: 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>What have you done to my face? 
      <p>MARCIEíS VOICE<br/>Your face. Thatís what itís all<br/>about, isnít it? 
      Your beautiful<br/>face. Thatís what makes you shine<br/>just a little bit 
      brighter than the <br/>rest of us. We all want what you<br/>have. To be 
      noticed. To be<br/>remembered. To be seen. 
      <p>CORDELIA<br/>(near panic)<br/>What are you doing? 
      <p>MARCIEíS VOICE<br/>Iím fulfilling your fondest wish.</p></p></p></center>
<p>She whips the towel off the cart to reveal a line of surgical 
      instruments, each more byzantine and horrific than the last.

      <p>WILLOW<br/>Whatíre a few sparks among friends? 
      <p>GILES<br/>Sparks... Sparks are caused by<br/>metal on metal...</p></p></center>
<p>Giles quickly takes off his jacket and wraps it around the large pipe 
      Xander was using. 
      <p>Coughing fiercely, the three stagger to their feet, holding the pipe 
      like a battering ram against the door lock.

<p>ANGLE: A SCALPEL 
      <p>is lifted into the air. For a moment the two girls just stare at it, 
      wondering which way it will head. 
      <p>It moves toward Cordelia. 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>Noo... 
      <p>MARCIEíS VOICE<br/>You should be grateful. People who<br/>pass you in the

<p>As she speaks, Buffy looks down at: 
      <p>ANGLE: A SCALPEL 
      <p>on the edge of the tray. Itís almost near enough to reach, and Buffy 
      strains her hand -- tied to the arm of the chair -- towards it. 
      <p>Cordelia sees what Buffy is doing, looks back ahead of her. The scalpel

      <p>looking at Cordelia, it hears a small CLATTER and the camera WHIPS over 
      to see what Buffy is up to. She is sitting, hand nowhere near the tray, 
      looking defeated. 
      <p>Cordelia tries to draw Marcieís attention back to her, saying: 
      <p>
<center>CORDELIA<br/>I do know how you feel, how<br/>lonely...</center>
<p>The POV goes back to Cordy. 
      <p>ANGLE: BUFFYíS HAND 
      <p>sitting on the arm of the throne. She moves it slightly to reveal the 
      scalpel under it. She palms it and begins sawing away at her bonds.
