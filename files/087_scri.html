      1)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Bright with fluorescent light. A 
      tired-looking Joyce is propped up in her hospital bed wearing pajamas. 
      Buffy and Dawn cuddle up on either side of her, wearing their street 
      clothes. All three pick at a tray of hospital food. They're trying to make 
      the best of a scary situation.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Listen, you two, I know this 
      creamed <br/>spinach is pretty delicious, but I promise <br/>I won't be 
      offended if you go out and <br/>get some real food.---</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Are you kidding me? This is 
      the good <br/>life. Relaxing in bed while people <br/>bring you food on 
      trays--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>And I like the 
      Jell-O.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Help yourself. There's 
      something <br/>about a food that moves all by <br/>itself that gives me the 
      heebie-jeebies.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn and Buffy both pick up small cubes of 
      Jell-O with their fingers, pop them in their mouth.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(mouth full)<br/>Mmm. Good 'n 
      wiggly.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>This girl at school? She told 
      me that <br/>gelatin is made from ground-up cow's<br/>feet and that every 
      time you eat Jell-O <br/>there's some cow out there limping <br/>around 
      without any feet. But I told <br/>her that I'm sure the cow is dead 
      <br/>before they cut its feet off, right?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(deadpan, to Joyce)<br/>You're 
      the one who insisted on<br/>teaching her to talk.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce smiles, enjoying her daughters. DR. 
      AARON KRIEGEL enters, 50ish, doctor-looking.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Oh hello, Dr. Kriegel. You've 
      met<br/>my girls, Buffy and Dawn.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. KRIEGEL<br/>Yes, of course. You two 
      are becoming <br/>part of the regular crew around here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Just keeping her 
      company.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. KRIEGEL<br/>Good for you. Just be 
      careful you<br/>don't wear her out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Don't worry about that. I woke 
      up <br/>exhausted, there's really no more <br/>exhausted to 
      get.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. KRIEGEL<br/>Well, maybe some good 
      news will <br/>help. The bloodwork has come back <br/>from the lab and 
      everything seems fine. <br/>So, we've gone ahead and scheduled <br/>your 
      surgery for the day after <br/>tomorrow at ten in the a.m. How does 
      <br/>that sound to you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>I think they have me scheduled 
      for <br/>volleyball, but I'll work around it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DR. KRIEGEL<br/>Alright then. Joyce, you 
      take care. <br/>Make sure to get some good solid rest. <br/>And I mean 
      that.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He smiles at them, and exits. Joyce's face 
      slowly drops.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>The day after tomorrow? I 
      don't know if <br/>I can stand to be stuck here for two more <br/>days just 
      waiting.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Waiting? Gimme a break- 
      We've<br/>got tons to do-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Yeah, we've got soap operas to 
      watch <br/>and trashy magazines to read ...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy looks around, spots the 
      bed-controls.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Ooh, and an adjustable bed to 
      fiddle <br/>with. That alone'll keep me going for <br/>the next four hours 
      or so.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Now Buffy, I really don't need 
      you to <br/>stay here all night. I know you've got <br/>patrolling to 
      do.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Not tonight. Tonight I have 
      Mom <br/>taking-care-of to do. Besides, Riley <br/>is filling in for me with 
      the others. <br/>I'm sure they've got everything under 
      <br/>control.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow, Xander, Giles are in the middle of 
      an intense fight with TWO WOMEN VAMPIRES. The Scoobies are working hard, 
      decidedly overmatched, and growing tired.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow moves to stake one of them, but 
      before she can deliver the fatal blow, the second vamp grabs her by the 
      waist and flings her to the ground. Giles and Xander each take on a 
      vampire, dodging the blows dealt as best they can.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow scrambles up from the ground and 
      DUSTS Giles' vamp from behind. An exhausted Giles rests with hands on 
      knees for just a second, nodding at Willow by way of thanks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then, together, they go to help Xander. And 
      just in time too, because Xander has been cornered up against a 
      tomb.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles raises his stake, charges at the vamp. 
      The vamp DUCKS OUT OF THE WAY. Giles almost stakes Xander.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Hey! Human chest! Human 
      chest!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Sorry.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow has lunged after the vamp, and 
      POOF... she stakes her second one of the night. It DUSTS.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>My god, a rough 
      night.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Whoa, I did two of 'em! Yay 
      on me! <br/>Pretty cool except for the part where I <br/>was really 
      terrified and now my knees <br/>are all dizzy.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Giles and Xander take Willow by the arms. 
      They start walking out of the graveyard together.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">XANDER<br/>Not so much a big 
      success-night for me, <br/>but I think I should get points just for 
      <br/>showing up. Unlike some Riley Finns <br/>who shall remain 
      unnamed.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">GILES<br/>Yes, that was disappointing. 
      Things <br/>would've been much easier with him here.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Oh piffle. Who needs him when 
      I'm<br/>slaying two at a time-- woops!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She stumbles and the others hold her 
      up.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Okay, it might have been good 
      if<br/>he'd showed.</font></center>

      stained bare mattress, a STRUNG OUT-LOOKING VAMPIRE CHICK wearing ratty 
      pants and a bra has her fangs imbedded in his arm. A few dollar bills are

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce sits up in bed, a book on her lap. 
      Willow enters and crosses to Buffy and Dawn who sit at a small table near 
      the window.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Care package! Special 
      delivery for <br/>the Summers girls.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow plops a large tote bag on the table. 
      She's high energy, eager to bring cheer to the others.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Now let's see what I have in 
      this sack <br/>of mine...Oh, I feel just like Santa Claus. <br/>Except 
      thinner, and younger, and female, <br/>and well, Jewish.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn pokes into the bag.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>What's that, a vacuum 
      cleaner?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Hey, watch it, Missy, or it's 
      coal in <br/>the socks for you. This is something <br/>extra-special for 
      your mother. 'Cause <br/>I knew she would need a ...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she pulls out several disconnected 
      pieces-of plastic and tubing:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Beer hat! See, it's got cup 
      holders and <br/>straws that go straight to your mouth and <br/>you can fill 
      it with other things than beer... <br/>and somehow when I was in the store 
      this <br/>seemed like the most important idea and <br/>now there's this 
      whole part where I'm crazy...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>It's perfect. Thank you, 
      Willow.<br/>You're so sweet.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce puts the beer hat next to her on the

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>Let me see, who's next? Dawn, 
      I believe <br/>I have something in here for you.</font></center>

      busy ...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As she extends a book to Dawn. The cover 
      reads "SPELLS: AN INTRODUCTION". Dawn's face lights up:</font></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Spells! Wow, cool. Thanks 
      Willow.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She immediately begins reading.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You got her a book of spells. 
      The girl <br/>who can break things by looking at <br/>them now has a book to 
      teach her <br/>how to, you know... break things by <br/>looking at 
      them.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>It doesn't actually have the 
      spells. It's <br/>just history, anecdotes, stuff like that. <br/>Oh Buffy. 
      Here. I have this for you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She pulls a textbook out of her tote bag for

      in tiny <br/>Jewish Santa anymore.</font></center>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Willow smiles apologetically and hands 
      something else to Buffy.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>And a yo-yo.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy accepts the yo-yo and the

<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>(re: the textbook)<br/>The 
      book is just in case you get a chance <br/>to look it over. We're doing 
      World War <br/>One now. The last exam was really pretty <br/>easy, all 
      underlying causes and trench foot. <br/>It should be no hassle to make 
      up--</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Will. Thank you. But to tell 
      you the <br/>truth, school is just about the last thing <br/>on my mind 
      right now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>I know.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I mean, I don't even know if 
      I'll<br/>take that exam.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>(loudly) <br/>I'd rip it in 
      half and then put it<br/>in bed with me.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy, Willow, and Dawn all look at Joyce: 
      what did she just say?</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Mom?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce looks at her innocently, apparently 
      not aware of what she just said.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>I think I'll take a rest 
      now.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The girls are a bit wigged. Joyce smiles at 
      them and nestles into her pillow, closing her eyes. Dawn and Willow look 
      to Buffy: 'What the hell?'</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Okay. We'll be right outside 
      if you <br/>need us.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce nods into her pillow and the girls 
      exit, flipping off the light.</font></p>

      fine.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>What was she talking 
      about?<br/>I mean, that was weird.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's okay. The doctor warned 
      me about <br/>it. I should've told you. It's just the... <br/>it's the thing 
      in her brain, it sort of... <br/>presses on something and it can make 
      <br/>her say weird things.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Does she know she's saying 
      it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Not really. I guess it's sort 
      of like a flash. <br/>You saw, the second after she said it, she <br/>was 
      normal.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">WILLOW<br/>And after the operation... no 
      more pressing... <br/>all normal, all the time.</font></center>
<p></p>

<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Is that

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As they cross paths, we shift directions and

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Getting a better look at the patient, we 
      recognize him as the older NIGHTWATCHMAN whose brain was sucked by Glory

      say<br/>a picnic is in order.</font></center>

      frames.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Nurse Lampkin goes to the door and TURNS OFF

      restraints, bucking the bed, but they do not give.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Skinny Patient watches from the adjacent

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn only hesitates a second before taking 
      action: she grabs the COAT-RACK by her door and hefts it like a bayonet, 
      charging at the Creature.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. JOYCE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn jabs the coat-rack at the Creature, 
      hitting it squarely and knocking it off the bed. It falls back onto the 
      floor, out of sight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn looks to her mother, who's desperately 
      trying to pull the sticky bile off her face so she can breathe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Creature suddenly JUMPS back onto the 
      bed, scampering across Joyce's legs, and SPRINGS at Dawn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn runs back into her room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. DAWN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUING - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn races through her room and out into the 
      hall.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where she's about to bolt for the stairs 
      when THE CREATURE bounds from Joyce's bedroom and blocks her path. Dawn's 
      only recourse is to head for the bathroom. Which she does.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS - 
NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn tries to shut the door but the Creature 
      has gotten a claw in. Dawn struggles to close it, throwing all her weight 
      against the door. But the Creature doesn't relent. Dawn tries to call for 
      help:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>Buffy! Buffy!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But she's out of breath and her plea is 
      barely audible. She pushes on the door, trying to keep the Creature at 
      bay.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy has cried herself out. She turns the 
      water to cold and splashes it on her face. Breathing deeply to calm 
      herself. Then she turns the faucet off. She begins to scrub the dishes 
      with a new vigor, as if focusing on cleaning will keep her mind from 
      thinking about anything else.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn races through the bathroom into Joyce's 
      bedroom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. JOYCE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dawn comes through the bathroom door, 
      SLAMMING it shut. She pushes up the nearby exer-cycle, barricading the 
      door. She runs around her mother's bed and SLAMS the door to her bedroom. 
      She YELLS through the door to the hallway:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>(with all her 
      strength)<br/>BUFFY! !</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">And SLAMS that door too.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Dawn?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN/STAIRS - SAME TIME - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">This Buffy hears. Immediately, she runs out 
      of the kitchen and charges up the stairs.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN (O.S..)<br/>(through the 
      door)<br/>Buffy!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy goes to the door of Joyce's bedroom, 
      opens it.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What is it?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN (O.S.)<br/>There's something out 
      there Buffy.<br/>It's after Mom!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Make it stop looking at me 
      Buffy... <br/>it chokes me ...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY -<br/>(shutting the door)<br/>You 
      two stay in there.<br/>Do not leave that-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Suddenly, WHOMP! The Creature drops on Buffy 
      from above, knocking her to her back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY WRESTLES WITH IT. They get to the edge 
      of the staircase and then begin to tumble down, still fighting, entwined 
      in each other's arms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy and the Creature come tumbling down. 
      They land hard and Buffy loses her grip on the Creature. It scrambles 
      away, quick as lightning. Buffy gets to her feet and pauses, listening 
      hard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. JOYCE'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce and Dawn hold each other tight, 
      terrified. Dawn grips an African sculpture - ready to use it as a weapon 
      if<br/>necessary. Joyce, lucid for the moment, tries her best to comfort 
      her.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>It's okay, my baby. It's 
      okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy enters, silent and coiled. Her eyes 
      scan the room, darting from shadow to shadow: where is the 
      Creature?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy enters the darkened kitchen. Her eyes 
      continue to scan, flicking from corner to corner. Smoothly, she pulls a 
      CARVING KNIFE from a knife block and cocks her arm back, ready.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She walks towards the stove, her eyes 
      missing nothing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SUDDENLY, SOMETHING SPRINGS OUT from the 
      basement behind her!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy whirls, knife ready... only to find 
      Spike, who holds something in one of his hands. Buffy glares at 
      him.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Spike.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike - caught - tries to play it 
      cool.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Yeah. Listen, did you hear a 
      noise?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>(cold)<br/>What the hell are 
      you<br/>doing in my house?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Right then, you caught me. 
      Your <br/>basement's full of junk and, me<br/>being in need of... junk 
      ...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You were 
      stealing?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>Well, yeah. Can't exactly work 
      the counter <br/>at Burger Barn, now can I?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But Buffy's not listening. She notices what 
      Spike is slipping into his jacket - photos of some kind. They almost look 
      like photos of <u>her</u>.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Wait. Are those pictures 
      of-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">But she doesn't get to finish before - 
      WHOMP! - the Creature drops on Spike from above, knocking him to the 
      ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike lets out a SCREAM! He wriggles under 
      the Creature, KICKING at it with his arms and legs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy readies her knife, waiting for a clear 
      shot at the Creature. But before she gets her chance, one of Spike's 
      thrashing legs KICKS THE KNIFE OUT OF HER HAND. It goes skittering across 
      the kitchen floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Without a weapon, Buffy has no choice but to 
      tackle the Creature. She and the Creature tumble out of the kitchen and 
      into the dining room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Meanwhile, Spike goes after the knife, he 
      grabs it and follows Buffy into the:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BUFFY'S DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS- 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Where Buffy and the Creature FIGHT, crashing 
      into the dining room furniture - making much mayhem.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>(re: 
      knife)<br/>Buffy!</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Spike tosses Buffy the carving knife. She 
      catches it deftly, just as the Creature POUNCES ON HER. Buffy lies on her 
      back with the Creature atop her. She holds the knife with two hands, 
      pointing the blade inwards, and THRUSTS IT TOWARDS HER OWN CHEST, as if 
      she were committing Hari-kari.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The blade impales the Creature. It stops 
      moving. Buffy lies there, the Creature heavy on her chest, goop oozing 
      from its body. A horrified beat ...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Then Spike extends a hand to Buffy, offering 
      to help her up. She accepts and stands up, covered in filth, exhausted. 
      It's going to be okay. When:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BANG! BANG! Suddenly, the front and back 
      doors are kicked in simultaneously. Spike and Buffy react as Riley and the 
      Black Ops charge into the house, weapons drawn. A few (which we will 
      assume includes GRAHAM) fan into the living room while the others enter 
      the dining room with Riley.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">His eyes take in everything: Buffy and 
      Spike; the wrecked dining room soaked with ooze; and the Creature, dead on 
      the floor.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">RILEY<br/>(to Buffy)<br/>Are you 
      okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">She doesn't answer. She just runs up the 
      stairs, Spike looks at Riley.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SPIKE<br/>You just missed a real nice 
      time.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Black Ops holster their guns.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. JOYCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy enters the room and runs to Joyce and 
      Dawn. She climbs onto the bed with them and the three embrace, holding 
      each other tightly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's gone. I killed 
      it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Oh, God...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DAWN<br/>It's gone? You 
      promise?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I promise. Everything's 
      alright.<br/>Everything's alright ...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The three continue to rock and hold each 
      other, wanting to believe it.</font></p>
<p align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="-1">FADE TO:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The street lamps that surround the parking 
      lot cast their yellowed light into the night. Ben walks briskly across the 
      shadowy parking lot. He looks a little messed up, sweat beaded on his 
      forehead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">As he walks, Ben reaches into his coat 
      pocket and removes a prescription bottle. He shakily opens it and pops a 
      few pills.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">He approaches his car and fumbles in his 
      pants pockets for the keys, looking over his shoulder to see if anyone is 
      behind him. There's no one. Ben finds his keys and hurriedly unlocks the 
      car door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. BEN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS - 
      NIGHT</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ben slides in, closes the door, and locks it 
      from the inside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">SUDDENLY, A VOICE:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DREG<br/>A body might ask what 
      <u>exactly</u> it<br/>is you think you're doing.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ben spins around. There in the back seat, is 
      a molting creature in a hooded garment: DREG, Glory's minion from episode 
      8.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DREG<br/>He might ask what all this was 
      meant<br/>to accomplish. Because to a humble <br/>postulant it looks like 
      chaos. Like <br/>unnecessary attention drawn where<br/>it ought not 
      be-</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Ben stares at Dreg. Says in a deadly 
      voice.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>Get out.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DREG<br/>Sir.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Dreg opens the passenger-side door but 
      pauses, turning to Ben:</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">DREG<br/>Forgive me. I just want to 
      understand. <br/>Why summon the Queller?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BEN<br/>Why do you think? Because I'm 
      cleaning <br/>up Glory's mess. Just like I've done my <br/>whole damn 
      life.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">With that he pushes Dreg out onto the 
      pavement and yanks shut the passenger-side door. He twists the key in the 
      ignition and tears off into the night, tires screeching.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">INT. JOYCE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING (DAY 
      3)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce is back in her hospital bed. Buffy 
      sits at her side, holding her mother's hand. A NURSE swabs Joyce's arm 
      with alcohol and inserts an intravenous needle. Joyce winces, keeps her 
      focus on Buffy. As the Nurse starts to exit.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Buffy?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Um hum?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>I…</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Nurse exits and Joyce draws closer to 
      her daughter.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>I want to ask you something... 
      And if I'm <br/>being crazy - you just tell me. Okay?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>You got it.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>The other day... Actually, I'm 
      not sure <br/>when. The days all seem to bleed <br/>together 
      ...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>It's not 
      important.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>No, I guess it isn't. I do 
      know I was <br/>pretty out of it. And I had - not a <br/>dream exactly. More 
      like, I had this <br/>knowledge. It just came to me - like <br/>truth, you 
      know? Even though it didn't <br/>seem possible. Even though I shouldn't 
      <br/>think such things.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>What, Mom? It's 
      okay.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce says the next with 
      difficulty.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>That 
      Dawn...<br/>(pained)<br/>She's not mine, is she?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy takes this in for a long beat. 
      Finally-</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>No.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce labors to understand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>She's - she does belong to us 
      though.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>Yes. She does.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>And she's important. To the 
      world. <br/>Precious ...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy nods. Joyce takes her hand.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>As precious as you are to 
      me?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy nods again - trying to hold it 
      together.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Then we have to take care of 
      her. <br/>Promise me, Buffy - if anything <br/>happens to me, if I don't 
      come<br/>through this-</font></center>

<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>No. Let me finish. No matter 
      what <br/>she is, she still feels like my daughter, <br/>and I have to know 
      you'll keep her safe. <br/>You'll love her like I love you.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Buffy fights tears.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">BUFFY<br/>I promise.</font></center>
<p></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>Good. Good...</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Joyce seems to relax a bit. Lays back and 
      pulls her daughter to her. Holds her tenderly.</font></p>
<p>
<center><font face="Verdana" size="-1">JOYCE<br/>My sweet, brave Buffy.<br/>What 
      would I do without you?</font></center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">CLOSE ON BUFFY</font></p>
