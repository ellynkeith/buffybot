<p><b>1     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
    Jonathan is packing up his bag, when Andrew comes to him and puts his right 
    hand on Jonathan's shoulder. Jonathan looks up at Andrew, stands. Jonathan's 
    eyes widen as Andrew takes his left hand and stabs him in the belly with a 
    dagger. Jonathan looks at Andrew, hurt. Jonathan collapses onto the metal 
    object that they unearthed. He bleeds profusely, with his blood filling the 
    grooves in the object.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER (V.O.)</b><br/>
  You killed your best friend.</p>

<p><b>3     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike is tied to the wheel-like construct with all four corners of his body 
    pulled in opposite directions. Spike's body has symbols carved into his chest. 
    Spike/First morphs into Buffy's form. A Harbinger cranks a wheel attached 
    to a mechanism that hoists the wheel Spike's tied to into the air. Spike is 
    now hanging from the wheel about ten feet from the ground, bleeding steadily 
    from his ritualized symbol-shaped cuts.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I bet that's what the First needed Spike for.</p>
<p><i>Spike's blood is falling on the Seal of Danthazar that's right below him. 
    It's pooling in the grooves and being absorbed into the seal. The seal starts 
    to glow. One by one, the pointed tips of the pentagram at its center fold 
    up, forming a pyramid. Light comes out from under it. </i></p>

  We don't have time to baby-sit a hostage.</p>

<p><b>5     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    After covering up the seal, Buffy and Dawn walk out of the Seal of Danthazar 
    room. Principal Wood passes them in the basement hallway, carrying a shovel, 
    looking a little disheveled.</b></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Apparently somebody left this in the courtyard, and I was just returning it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  That's some full-service principaling.</p>

  I try.</p>

<p><b>6     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Spike is sitting on a cot, his wrists chained to the wall. Suddenly, his face 
    contorts and he twitches.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Ow ow ow! (leans back, thrashes against the wall, holds his hands to his head, 
  writhing in intense pain)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  There's gotta be a reason why the chip is going all wonky.</p>

<p><b>7     INT.     THE INITIATIVE 
    SUNNYDALE HEADQUARTERS - DAY<br/>
    Buffy's standing outside the examination room where Spike is lying on a table. 
    The lead soldier comes up to her. She turns to look at him.</b></p>
<p><b>SOLDIER</b><br/>
  This chip...we can either repair it... or remove it.</p>

    Giles enters the flat and sees Robson, who's found near a chair in the next 
    room. Giles goes to his side.</b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Robson!</p>
<p><b>XANDER (V.O.)</b><br/>
  Robson blacked out, but the last thing he remembers is Giles's head about to 
  get real familiar with a Bringer's very sharp axe.</p>
<p><b>ROBSON</b><br/>
  (eyes flash open) It's started... </p>
<p><i>A Bringer steps up behind Giles, carrying an axe.</i></p>

<p><b>9     INT.     FLAT IN 
    ENGLAND - DAY<br/>
    Resume. Giles is talking to Robson while a Bringer sneaks up behind him, wielding 
    an axe.</b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  I understand. I'll take care of i—</p>
<p><i>One of the robed men sneaks up behind Giles wielding a battle-axe. He swings 
    it at Giles. Giles grabs the shaft of the axe right before the blade touches 
    him. He stands, punches the Bringer in the stomach, and takes control of the 
    axe. Holding the axe handle with a hand on either end, he knocks the Bringer 
    in the chin, sending him backwards into a chair. Giles swings the axe at the 
    Bringer's neck, chopping off its head.</i></p>

    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT<br/>
    Giles is telling his story to the girls as they patrol. Buffy, Kennedy, Amanda 
    and a new slayer in training are with him.</b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  It was, uh, extraordinary good luck, of course. And—and, uh, training—years 
  of training. Chao-Ahn, keep up. You're new here, Chao-Ahn, so take note. Remember 
  about training. But I honestly feel the largest part of it was instinct. Instinct 
  and-and reflexes. There's a sort of wary watchfulness I've developed over the 
  years. It's like another sense—</p>
<p><i>From out of nowhere, someone attacks Giles, knocking him to the ground. 
    It's Spike.</i></p>

<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>11     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Buffy's sitting at her vanity, putting on large gold hoop earrings. She's 
    wearing a thin v-necked red sweater. Giles walks down the hall toward her 
    room and stops at the doorway.</b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  You know this is very dangerous.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Ah, you just heard the horror stories. Wear hoops, they'll catch on something, 
  rip your lobe off. Lobes flying everywhere.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  (rolls eyes) That's not what I'm talking about.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You mean Spike not having a chip. Free range Spike?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  I have to ask—why on Earth did you make that decision?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Guess it was instinct, like you were talking about.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  I made that up! (walks into the room) I knew the Bringer was there because his 
  shoes squeaked. (sits on her vanity) Buffy, it's crucial that we keep these 
  girls safe. I can't count the dangers—the First, the Bringers, random demons, 
  and now Spike?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  And the Principal.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  What?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Oh, nothing much. He was in the school basement, holding a shovel, acting evasive. 
  Plus, he's got that whole "too charming to be real" thing going on. 
  I'm looking into it.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  (stands) Oh, well that sounds very responsible of you. Balances out the vampire-on-the-loose 
  issue.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (stands, walks across the room to fold laundry) Nothing's changed, Giles. Spike 
  had a chip before, remember? When the First had him kill and sire all those 
  people.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  We have no idea if his chip was working then. (takes off glasses) A new chip 
  might restrain him should the First attempt to activate him again.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (turns to face Giles) Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from 
  hurting people.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Buffy...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it. But he's never gonna get there if we 
  don't give him the chance. (walks to her closet to put the clothes away)</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  (walks up to Buffy) Buffy, I want more for you. Your feelings for him are coloring 
  your judgement. I can hear it in your voice. (Buffy sighs) And that way lies 
  a future filled with pain. I don't want that for you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    We haven't— (looks uncomfortable) Things have been different since he 
    came back.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  It doesn't matter if you're not physical with each other anymore. There's a 
  connection. You rely on him, he relies on you. That's what's affecting your 
  judgment.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You think I'm losing sight of the big picture, but I'm not. When Spike had that 
  chip, it was like having him in a muzzle. It was wrong. You can't beat evil 
  by doing evil. I know that. (walks out of the room) </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  (calling after her, calmly) Well, I hope you're right. You're gambling with 
  a lot of lives.</p>

    IMPROVEMENT STORE - DAY<br/>
    Xander's standing around in a crowd of customers watching a green-aproned 
    store employee cut a length of pipe with a huge power tool. He looks around 
    and notices a pretty woman looking at the spools of rope on a display. Xander 
    walks over to her, taking off his safety glasses.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Hi, can I help? You seem kind of confused. </p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
  (holding a rope, looks at his clothes) You aren't wearing a green apron.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Confused, but sort of randomly observant.</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
  Sorry, I just mean... you don't work here, right?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  No. Right. Just helpful. I'm Xander.</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
  Lissa. (they shake hands) And I guess I could use some advice. I can't even 
  figure out if I've got the right kind of rope. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  That depends on what you need it for. Something like functional around the house, 
  or, you know, recreational. (Lissa raises her eyebrows and grins) By which I 
  mean, for example, boating or mountain climbing—not for tying someone up for 
  sexy, funky fun. (Lissa giggles) In conclusion, rope can be useful in various 
  ways.</p>
<p><b>WOMAN/LISSA</b><br/>
  I have a kayak.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Again with the random. I like it.</p>
<p><b>LISSA</b><br/>
  Sorry. I need to store my kayak. So I was thinking maybe I could sorta suspend 
  it from the ceiling in the garage with ropes and a pulley or a winch thing.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Not a bad plan. You'll need stronger rope than that. Wanna have coffee with 
  me later?</p>
<p><b>LISSA</b><br/>
  What?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Oh, you're the only one that gets to be random? (Lissa smiles) </p>

<p><b>13     INT.     PRINCIPAL 
    WOOD'S OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    While no one is looking, Buffy walks into the office labeled "Principal. 
    Robin M. Wood" on it and closes the door behind her. She looks through 
    files on his desk, then looks around the room.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Now, if I were a sign of being evil, where would I be? </p>
<p><i>Buffy notices a wall cabinet, and walks up to it. Before she can open it, 
    Principal Wood walks into the office. </i></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Uh, Buffy?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (turns to face him) Principal Wood. It's you.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  You looking for something?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  File folders. And mechanical pencils. Well, I want to write on a file folder 
  with a mechanical pencil.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  The supply cabinet in the outer office has those things.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Oh, this isn't a supply cabinet? My bad. OK. Thanks. (starts to walk out)</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  (steps in her path) Hey, Buffy...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Yeah?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Um, what're you doing tonight?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Preparing for tomorrow's counseling sessions.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  No, really.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Watching a reality show about a millionaire.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
    Well, then, I'd, um— I'd like to take you out to dinner, if that's all 
    right with you. I mean, you don't have to. I'm certainly not saying come to 
    dinner if you enjoy having a job. (chuckles then realizes what he said) You 
    know, I may have to make up a document saying I didn't just say that and have 
    you sign it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (smiles) Sure. I'd be happy to have dinner with you.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Great. I'll draw up the paperwork.</p>
<p><i>Buffy nods and walks out of the office. Principal Wood closes his office 
    door after her, then takes a bloody handkerchief out of his breast pocket. 
    He unfolds the bloody handkerchief, revealing a knife inside. Wiping the blood 
    off the knife, he walks toward the cabinet Buffy had been curious about. Upon 
    opening it, there's just a standard dry-erase board inside until the Principal 
    raises it out of the way to show a hidden compartment behind it where dozens 
    of exotic knives are displayed. He puts the knife he's holding back in it's 
    place and looks over his shoulder toward the door.</i></p>

<h3>ACT II:</h3>
<p><b>14     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Buffy's sitting on the couch while Willow's folding laundry from the laundry 
    basket beside her.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (folding socks) So, he asked you out to dinner?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Yeah. Isn't that weird? I mean, he's a Principal. He's a young, hot Principal 
  with earrings, but he's a Principal. Why do you think he asked me out? I mean, 
  he could be interested, right?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Yeah, sure. You're a frisky vixen.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Or, it could be work-related. Maybe I'm getting promoted for doing such a good 
  job.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (laughs, then notices Buffy's hurt look and gets serious) Oh, right, that—that 
  makes sense too.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Or, maybe he knows that I suspect he's up to something, and he's taking me out 
  to kill me.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (shrugs) Well, you'll have to dress for the ambiguity.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You know, it's not even that he's acting that suspicious. It's just—there he 
  is. On the hell mouth. All day, every day. That's got to be like being showered 
  with evil. Only from underneath.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Not really a shower.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  A bidet. Like a bidet of evil.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Buff, if he's really interested, (smiles) are you interested back?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (blushes) I don't know. He's good-looking, and he's—he's solid, he's smart, 
  he's normal. So, not the wicked energy, which is nice 'cause I don't want to 
  only be attracted to wicked energy. Or what if he is wicked, in which case, 
  is that why I'm attracted to him?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I'm gonna wait for that sentence to come around again before I jump on. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (grins) You know what? Yeah, I mean I think I like him. And he'd be good for 
  me.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (nods) Right. Help you move on.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (defensively) Why does everybody in this house think I'm still in love with 
    Spike?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  No, I-I meant move on from this imposed super-self-reliance. Let somebody get 
  close.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Oh. (the front door opens) Hey, someone's here.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (comes in through the front door, giddy) Guys, guess what happened.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (grins) Buffy got a date!</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (excited) No, I did. (looks at Buffy, frowning) Fine. Way to steal my thunder.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Sorry. If it makes you feel better, it's Principal Wood, and I think he's aligned 
  with the First.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Also, like ten years older than you, right?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (teasing) Which is like 100 years younger than your type!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Yay. Someone who doesn't remember the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I think they're gonna end up making out. (mocking, holds a pair of socks to 
  her chest lovingly) "Oh, Principal Wood," she'll gasp, "I love 
  your lack of wicked energy."</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (throws a pair of socks at Willow) Watch it, or I'm gonna make you talk about 
  your new girlfriend who you hold hands with under the dinner table and think 
  we don't notice. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  How 'bout yours, Xander. Is she evil?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Well, she's interested in me, so there's a good chance, but I'm hoping for 
    the best. We're going for coffee. She has a kayak—</p>
<p><i>Giles and Chao-Ahn come through the front door, loaded with overflowing 
    shopping bags.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (putting down the shopping bags) Dear lord, I hate that mall. The shop assistants 
    are rude. And everything in the Food Court is sticky. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Looks like you found her some stuff. </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Oh, hello. Yes. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  That's gotta be rough. Getting just like pulled out of your home, being told 
  you're a potential slayer, not being able to bring anything.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Yes, and the language barrier is formidable. I was concerned that my Mandarin 
  is a little thin, but as it turns out, she speaks Cantonese, which is thinner. 
  But we muddled through, and, as I suspected, ice cream is a universal language.</p>

  Hey, Will, do you think you can do a computer check on Principal Wood. See if

  Yeah, sure. Want me to check your girl out while I'm at it, Xand?</p>

  Nope. I'm going in blind. I'm gonna be an optimist about this. Why go looking

  You don't need a manual, it's intuitive. (Andrew notices Jonathan/First and 
  backs away into the corner) There's a button marked "Clock Set" for 
  pity's sake. What kind of a nerd are you? (scoffs) No wonder you crashed your 
  jet pack.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  No, get thee behind me. (takes a cross out of his jeans pocket) I rebuke thee. 
  (holds out the cross) Take that, The First!</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST</b><br/>
  (rolls his eyes) Look, you monkey. (walks up to Andrew, sticks out his hand 
  and passes through the cross) Ooh. Ahh. It burns as it ineffectually passes 
  through me. (puts his hand at his side) I'm not corporeal, remember. Also, not 
  a vampire, so—a cross?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>

  First?</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST</b><br/>
  I have an assignment for you.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Um, I follow Buffy's orders now. I'm redeeming myself for... killing you—I 
  mean, for... killing Jonathan.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST</b><br/>
  Really, why? (laughs) So you can earn a spot on her little pep squad? You think 
  she'll ever let you in? You're a murderer.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  (nods) Confidentially, a lot of her people are murderers. Anya and Willow and 
  Spike.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST</b><br/>
  Interesting. And you're the only one she makes seek redemption. Does that seem 
  fair to you?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>

  You know we're headed toward a fight, don't you?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST</b><br/>
  What do you think the world's gonna be like after that? Newsflash. There's not 
  going to be a slayer gang anymore. But there is going to be Evil. And as long 
  as there is Evil, I live. And as long as I live, you can dwell at my side.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  That sounds nice.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST</b><br/>
  Your assignment won't be hard. They're just little girls. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  You want me to hurt the girls?</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST</b><br/>
  Uh, no, not all of them. Not Dawn, not Anya, not Willow, and not your friend 
  Buffy. Just the potential slayers.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  That's—that's horrible. (points) I'm-I'm gonna scream and—and get Buffy in 
  here. </p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST</b><br/>
  She can't see me, and I'm gonna keep talking until you hear what I have to say, 
  so listen up, OK? The girls must die.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  (breathes deeply) I could never do that. All those girls, a-all that blood—I-I 
  didn't like the stabbing before.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST</b><br/>
  You don't have to stab. This'll be easy. Andrew, I want you to think. Willow 
  brought something to this house—something good, something you can use.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  (thinks for a moment, then gestures spokes-model-style) The new microwave?</p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (nervously) Um, something got her... a demon—?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  A vampire. Oh, man, I went through this whole "avenging son" phase 
  in my twenties, but I never found him. So, now I just dust as many of them as 
  I can find. I figure, eventually I'll get him. That's probably why we got jumped 
  outside. I'm not very popular with the bumpy-foreheaded crowd, and I bet you 
  aren't either.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (shakes head) No. Not most of them. Um, so, do you have any slayer powers? (giggles) 
  I'm sorry, I—I'm just so floored. I-I have no idea what to ask.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  No, I don't have powers. No super-strength or mythic responsibilities. I'm just 
  a guy with a few skills 'cause her watcher took me in and raised me.</p>

  (shakes his head) You're gonna pay for more than that. Do you know why? Because 
  the biggest, baddest First Evil in the world's angry with you.</p>

    Willow's still listening in on Andrew's conversation with the First, wearing 
    her headphones again. </b></p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST (O.S.)</b><br/>
  (echoy) You think this was smart?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (gasps, picks up her pen and paper) Wait. I'm hearing something.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST (O.S.)</b><br/>
  You think you can trick me, women?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  (stands, looks around nervously, takes off Willow's headphones) It's not in 
  the headphones. It's out here. </p>
<p><b>JONATHAN/FIRST (O.S.)</b><br/>
  You only hear what I want you to hear. You only see what I want you to see.</p>
<p><i>Jonathan/First appears behind Amanda in a flash of light. His body is very 
    decayed now, glistening and purplish with one side of his face rotting faster 
    where the flesh is opened and the eye is white. Amanda screams and the other 
    girls back away, frightened.</i></p>

    that Spike was hung on when he was drained to open the Seal of Danthazar. 
    Lissa is standing near the pulley.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  See? I knew it.</p>
<p><b>LISSA</b><br/>
  Thanks for your help selecting the ropes. The one I picked wasn't strong enough.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Yeah, that would've been bad. Listen, is this because I'm friends with Buffy?</p>
<p><b>LISSA</b><br/>
  Who's Buffy?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  The slayer.</p>
<p><b>LISSA</b><br/>
  You know the slayer?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (Lissa starts pulling on the rope, lifting the wheel Xander's attached to into 
  the air) This can't just happen. It can't just keep happening that demon women 
  find me attractive. There's gotta be a reason.</p>
<p><b>LISSA</b><br/>
  You just seem like a nice guy, that's all. And I wanted to get to know you.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  And kill me?</p>
<p><b>LISSA</b><br/>

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (with Kennedy sitting on the chair, leaning over Willow's shoulder) So, we're 
  thinking it didn't go too well.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (to Andrew, removing the tape that held the wire to his chest) You should've 
  let me do this fast.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  (wincing) No, no, no. I hate that. Ow.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  You tried to recall the ultimate evil? Why? In a complex effort to royally piss 
  it off?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  Guess we succeeded pretty good, huh?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  God, I never should have gone in wired. (whiny) Redemption is hard.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Getting back to Spike's question, why did you try to recall it?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Ooh!</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  To study it. To see if we could figure something out from what it was saying. 
  Because, guys, we have to face it, we know nothing about the First.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Owie! Ow ow!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Well, we know not to record it. That's something.</p>

    Why did it appear to this one, then? (gestures to Andrew) I thought it was 
    supposed to be pulling my strings.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  It said it wasn't time for you yet. (Dawn pulls off the last piece of tape) 
  Ow. I'm frightened. And my chest hurts where the tape was. (sits down)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  It's OK, Andrew. You did good. You stood up to it. That's really amazing.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Thank you. You're a peach.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Yeah. What did it want you to do, anyway?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Shoot all the girls.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (worried) Shoot girls?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Not you, just the potentials.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (relieved) Oh, well that's something, anyway. (covering for her relief, looks 
  around, sounding concerned again) Something tragic.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  This proves my point. This time is crucial. We should be circling the wagons 
  instead of doing things like going out on dates when—when gunplay is imminent. 
  Willow, call Buffy. Get her back here. We need to dispose of the gun and-and 
  figure out our next move.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I'll go get her.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I'll call. (a cell-phone rings in the background)</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
  Bet that's her. Sometimes you're thinking about calling someone—</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (looking at her phone) No, it's a text message. (reading) Oh, it's from Xander. 
  It's one of our signals.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
  Signals?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Yeah, the system we set up a while back. Like codes. Uh, this one's either "I 
  just got lucky, don't call me for a while" or "my date's a demon who's 
  trying to kill me."</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  You don't remember which?</p>

  It was a long time ago.</p>

<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Buffy will know what to do.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I'll go get her. (starts to go) </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    That's ok. (Spike sighs) We don't even know where she went. (a cell phone 
    rings in the background, zoom in on Buffy's cell phone that says "Willow 
    Calling." Willow picks up Buffy's phone from the table beside her.) That's 
    not good.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I'll go get Buffy. I can probably still track her scent. She'll be worried about

  Oh, my God! Mmm. Oh, my God. That might be the best thing I've ever had in my

  Look, I know what happens if that seal down there gets all excited. I don't 
  think you understand what you're getting yourself into.</p>
<p><b>LISSA</b><br/>
  The seal opens, and a vicious feral vampire creature comes out.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Well, then you do understand. But, uh, what makes you think that's, like, a 
  good idea?</p>
<p><b>LISSA</b><br/>
  The end is coming. The final fight, and everyone is hearing the drumbeat. It's 
  telling us to pick our partners, align ourselves with the good or the evil. 
</p>
<p><i>Lissa reaches behind her to grab a long, thin knife. When she turns back 
    to face Xander, her eyes have changed to a yellow lizard-eyed look. She stabs 
    Xander in the belly.</i></p>

    down in the corner of the back seat.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You sure he's in the high school?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Willow did a locator spell. Usual stuff. </p>

  Ten minutes. (Principal Wood watches the rear view mirror suspiciously) So, 
  how do you two know each other?</p>

    punching her and disarming her by knocking the knife from her hand.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Buffy!</p>
<p><i>Buffy and Lissa are fighting when Spike enters the room. Lissa starts 
    whaling on Spike. She kicks Buffy away, knocking her to the ground. She pushes 
    Spike down and starts strangling him, bringing forth Spike's vampire facade.

  He's a vampire.</p>

  Oh, God! Hurry!</p>
<p><i>Principal Wood stops staring at Spike and goes to aid Xander, cutting 
    the ropes that hold his hands to the wheel, but the seal is already beginning 
    to open. Across the room, Buffy knocks Lissa off of Spike. A Turok-Han is 
    reaching out of the seal as it opens, but Principal Wood escapes its grasp 
    as he finally gets Xander down from the wheel. The seal slams shut, cutting 
    off the arm of the Turok-Han that was reaching out. Principal Wood sets Xander 
    down against a wall. </i></p>
<p><i>Buffy and Lissa are still fighting, struggling over possession of a sword. 
    Lissa knocks Buffy across the room, but Buffy holds on to the sword. Spike 
    engages in fighting Lissa, but he's getting his butt kicked. Buffy pulls Lissa 
    away from Spike and cuts off Lissa's head with the sword. As her head is separated 
    from her body, Lissa's true form is revealed as a gruesome pinkish creature 
    with hairy shoulders and stitches all over its head and nasty black shark 
    teeth on its lipless jaws.</i></p>

    and goes to Xander. Principal Wood and Spike follow.</i></p>

  Where are they? It's after 2. I can't believe Buffy hasn't brought him home
