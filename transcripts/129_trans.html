  MEXICAN CAR - NIGHT<br/>Jonathan's driving with Andrew as passenger. The old El 
  Camino car is heavily adorned in super-stereotypical Mexican style: older 
  model car with fringe around the top of the windshield and lots of 
  decorations.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>(sighs) You keep circling around. Just—just drive straight 
  in.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>Will you shut up? We gotta keep it low pro.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>You're just scared.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>Of course I'm scared. Last time we were here, 33.3bar 
  percent of us were flayed alive. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>Calm down. No one's getting flayed alive. We got a plan. 
  We're gonna fix all that.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>Wish I'd have stayed in Mexico.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>Ah, I didn't like it there. Everybody spoke Mexicalan.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>You could've learned it. You learned the entire Klingon 
  dictionary in two and a half weeks.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>That had much clearer transitive and intransitive rules, 
  OK? Besides, I can't keep having those nightmares.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>Me neither. Desde abajo te debora.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>"It eats you starting with your bottom."</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>Gonna make it right. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>(getting misty-eyed) We're outlaws with hearts of gold.</p>

  SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHT<br/>Buffy's fighting the fledgling vampire who rose 
  earlier. He's rather a strong and capable fighter against her.</b></p>

<p><b>25     INT.      
  KITCHEN AT THE SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>Dawn's eating pizza in the 
  kitchen.</b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>(singing) Anchovies, anchovies, you're so delicious. I love 
  you more than all the other fishes.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>26     INT.      
  BUFFY'S ROOM AT THE SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>Dawn is holding a slice of pizza 
  while going through Buffy's clothes and holding them up to her in front of the 
  mirror. She accidentally brushes the pizza against a white blouse.</b></p>

  LIVING ROOM AT THE SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>Dawn's playing with the Buffy's 
  weapons. First, she's swinging the battle-axe.</b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>Taste my blade, spawn of evil!</p>
<p><i>She swings the axe, and the blade lands in some furniture. Then she gets 
  out the crossbow and loads it. She's pointing it around like she's one of the 
  Charlie's Angels or something. She accidentally pulls the trigger, causing the 
  arrow to shoot out. It lands in the living room wall. When she tries to pull 
  the arrow out, a large chunk of plaster comes with it. Her eyes widen, and she 
  looks around for some way to cover it up. She moves the nearby tall houseplant 
  in front of the hole.</i></p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>28     INT.      
  KITCHEN AT THE SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>Dawn's listening to Mexican music and 
  dancing around the kitchen. She gets a jumbo marshmallow out of the cabinet 
  and puts it into the microwave on a little plate. While heating up, the 
  marshmallow starts to swell and expand; Dawn seems impressed. </b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>(laughs) Cool.</p>
<p><i>She jumps when she hears a sound from somewhere else in the house.

  SUNNYDALE LIBRARY - NIGHT<br/>Willow's still studying at the table, leaning her 
  head over, propping it up on one arm, slouching a bit. Then someone starts 
  talking to her through one of the nearby stacks. It's Cassie, from 7x04 
  "Help."</b></p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>So, (Willow turns to look) this is the UC library, huh? 
  It's so big. Hey.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>I know you. I mean, I saw your picture.</p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>(walks out from behind the stacks to Willow's table) Yeah, 
  I know, it's kinda weird 'cause we never really met.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>Or kinda weird because your're really dead. </p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>Yeah well... (laughs)</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>Did I fall asleep?</p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>No, no, I'm here. I mean, not-not here here... it's kinda 
  complicated. Kind of ironic, too, you know. I wrote all that intense poetry about the 
  end, and here I am again. Chatting you up.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>Yeah, ironic. </p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>I knew this would completely freak you out. It's just— 
  (sits at Willow's table) she asked that I come talk to you. It's 
important.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>She?</p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>Don't worry. I'm not gona hurt you or anything—</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>Who asked you? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>She says she still sings.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>What?</p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>Remember that time on the bridge when you sang to each 
  other? Well, she says even though you can't hear it, she still sings to 
  you.</p>

<p><b>30     INT.      
  LIVING ROOM AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>Dawn's talking on the cordless phone, 
  sitting in front of the television, eating gooey marshmallow. An old black and 
  white movie is playing on TV; it looks like it might be a classic horror 
  flick.</b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>(to phone) Oh, come on. She is so dead. Well, he's clearly a 
  psychopath. Is so. What? No, that is not Tom Hanks. Well, what channel are you 
  on? (knock) OK, there it is again. I keep hearing this, like, thumping. (mutes 
  television) (knock, knock) No, I-I can't tell if it's—</p>
<p><i>The front door flies open. Dawn goes to investigate, and a strong wind 
  is blowing into the house. She struggles to shut the door.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>(to phone) Kit, are you there? Is there a storm?</p>
<p><i>Suddenly, the television is unmuted, playing loudly. She tries to mute 
  it again, but the remote control button doesn't have any effect. She tries the 
  power button on the television itself, but it doesn't work either. Finally, 
  she tries to unplug it, but the old movie still plays with the cord out of the 
  wall. Dawn's eyes grow wide with fear. </i></p>

  SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHT<br/>Buffy's still fighting the fledgling vampire. 
  He's dressed in a nice black suit, wearing a light blue shirt and a tie. 
  They're having quite a row, throwing each other against headstones and such. 
  Finally, the vampire pushes Buffy back against a headstone and grabs her 
  throat, going for the kill, when he stops, and speaks to her:</b></p>
<p><b>VAMPIRE</b><br/>Buffy? (laughs) Buffy Summers?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Have we—</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN/VAMPIRE</b><br/>Oh, uh. Webs? Holden Webster. We went to school

<p><b>32     INT.      
  LIVING ROOM AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>Dawn's scared. Mexican music is 
  playing loudly. The television won't shut off and is playing the old horror 
  movie loudly. Dawn smashes the TV with an axe and breaks it. She smashes the 
  stereo as well. The music is still coming from the kitchen.</b></p>

  KITCHEN AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>She sees the radio—the one she was dancing 
  to earlier—sitting there on the countertop, playing Mexican music. She walks 
  further into the room, hoisting the battleaxe, when the microwave oven 
  suddenly comes on.</b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>Oh, God. Oh, God...</p>
<p><i>She smashes the microwave, causing a tiny explosion and shattering glass 
  on the floor. She backs away from the explosion, but she's in bare feet and 
  the shattered glass cuts her. The radio on the kitchen counter is 
  still going. Suddenly, tuning sound comes over the radio, causing the music to 
  fade and a voice comes over the radio:</i></p>

  SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHT<br/>In vampire visage, the fledgling vampire is 
  talking casually to Buffy. </b></p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>OK, um, junior year, spring production of Pippin, uh, I 
  did the lighting design.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>I didn't see it. </p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>But you'd helped me move the lighting board, and I dropped 
  it on your foot. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Right, foot. Yes, of course. History class. It's all coming 
  back. Sorry.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Well, you know, it's not like I was a big part of your 
  life or anything.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>No, I just—I didn't recognize you, you know, your face, all 
  demon, and I think you've filled out a lot.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Oh, yeah, well I got into to Tae Kwon Do in a big way at 
  Dartmouth, so...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>That's great. </p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>So what have you been up to?</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Well, apparently dying. (they laugh) Uh, no, but other 
  stuff. (they start walking) Uhh, you know, majoring in Psych. Really liking 
  that. Uhh, took a year of to do an internship at the Sunnydale Mental 
  Hospital.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Wow. That's gotta be a... popular 
  joint.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>I—I keep telling them we ought to get a velvet rope and a 
  bouncer. (they stop walking) Hey, you remember Jason Wheeler, you know, "Crazy 
  J"? </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(leans on nearby headstone) Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>He always had that shtick of (waves hands around) "Yeah, 
  I'm crazy, I'm crazy."</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>How is he?</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Crazy. He's been in the chronic ward since graduation. 
  (laughs, then stops) Not really that funny, I guess.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Ironic, sorta.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Yeah. (face changes from vampire to normal) Whoa. Did my 
  face just change?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Yeah. You look human now. You can do that—go back and 
  forth.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Oh, so I'm a vampire. (laughs) How weird is that?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Sorry.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>No, no. Feels great. Strong. Like I'm connected to a 
  powerful all-consuming evil that's gonna suck the world into a firey oblivion. 
  How 'bout you?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Not so much connected. (stands and walks away, he 
  follows)</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>No, no. I mean, with the stake and the cross—you do this 
  kind of thing a lot?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(stops walking, turns to face him) I'm the slayer. It's 
  sort of a thing.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>So, what—you like fight vampires professionally? Or—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Oh, I don't get paid. It's more like a calling. Since—even 
  in school.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>I heard a lot of rumors about you back then. You were all 
  mysterious.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>I was?</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Well, you were never around. A lot of kids thought you 
  were dating some really old guy, or that you were just heavy religious. Scott 
  Hope said you were gay. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>What? I dated that ringworm.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>He says that about every girl he breaks up with. And then 
  last year, big surprise, he comes out.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(shakes her head) Men. Do I know how to pick 'em.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>So, all that time, you were a slayer?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>The.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>"The", like as in "the only one"?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Pretty much.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Oh. So, when you said not connected, that was kind of a 
  telling statement, wasn't it—?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(puts hands on hips) Ah, Psych 101 alert. </p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Well, I'm just saying.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Yeah, what I really need is emotional therapy from the evil 
  dead. </p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Hey, it was your phrase.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>I'm connected. I'm connected to a lot of people, OK.</p>

<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>Buffy, come on, pick up. I don't know what to do!</p>
<p><i>Dawn hangs up the phone and picks up the radio that was in the kitchen

  as she was when Buffy found her dead in episode 5x17 "The Body".</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>(crying) Do it again! I heard you.</p>

  empty. The lights go out for a second. When they come back on, Dawn can see 
  that all the dining room chairs have been placed upside down on the dining 
  room table in the next room. The weapons chest has been turned on end, 
  spilling its contents onto the floor. She looks around, frightened, and sees a 
  message written on the wall in blood: "<font color="#990000"><b>Mother's Milk is RED Today</b></font>", and 
  there's a bloody handprint below it. The lights dim again for only a moment, 
  and when they come back on, the message is gone and the weapons chest and the 
  dining room furniture are back in their normal configurations again. Dawn shivers. There's a 
  knocking sound: <b>knock, knock, knock</b>.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>Why are you doing this!</p>
<p><b><i>Knock.</i></b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>Why are you— I don't understand. (knocking continues) Stop. 
  Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Aah!</p>
<p><i>Knocking stops.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>Hello?</p>
<p><b><i>Knock.</i></b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>(to herself) Once for yes... (out loud) Once for yes, twice 
  for no. Mom? (looks around) </p>
<p><b><i>Knock.</i></b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>Mom, it's you?</p>
<p><b><i>Knock.</i></b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>Are you OK?</p>
<p><b><i>Knock. Knock.</i></b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>You're not. Mom... mommy... are you alone?</p>
<p><b><i>Knock. Knock.</i></b></p>
<p><i>The house starts to shake, like an earthquake, but not. A strobe light 
  flashes in Dawn's face. Dawn screams. Home decor is falling to the floor 
  everywhere: lamps, pictures, vases, etc. </i></p>

<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>I ain't goin' back to the big house. That place changes

<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>OK, uh, um, uh, you go check down the hallway (points

  SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHT<br/>Buffy's lying down on her back on a stone

  pillow. Holden is sitting on a nearby headstone, talking to her. She's playing 
  with the cross pendant on the necklace she's wearing.</b></p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>So, you meet someone, you form a bond...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>But it never lasts.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Do you mean in all relationships, or just yours?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>My parents weren't exactly the paragon of 
  stay-togetherey-ness. Maybe that's part of it. I think there're people out 
  there who'd make it. I just... target the impossible ones... with deadly 
  accuracy.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>You think you do that on purpose? Maybe you're trying to 
  protect yourself?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Protecting myself? From heartbreak, misery, sexual 
  violence, and possible death? Not so much.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>From committing.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(sits up) I commit. I'm committed. I'm a committee.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>So it's them? You're reaching out, they're just not coming 
  through?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(shifts her body) It's different. I think you're confusing 
  me because you're evil.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>I just think you're in some pain here—which I do kind of 
  enjoy 'cause I'm evil now—but you should just ease up on yourself. It's not 
  exactly like you have the patent on bad relationships.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Wouldn't it be cool if I did?</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>And what are you—supposed to be settling down already? At 
  21? You know, my girlfriend at college, she's so sweet. We have this great 
  thing, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna go vampify her just so we can be 
  together forever.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Sire.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>What?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>The word—when you turn a human into a vampire—it's you 
  "sire" them.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Cool.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>It's a noun too.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>(stands, leans on nearby headstone) Oh, I have so much to 
  learn. Come on, isn't this insane? I mean, I was afraid to talk to you in high 
  school, and now we're, like, mortal enemies. Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we 
  became nemeses?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Is that how you say the word?</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>We're gonna have to fight to the death, aren't we?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>It's the time-honored custom.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Wow, reality just shows up sometimes, doesn't it? But, you 
  know, I've got the bloodlust pumping, and I kinda get it. I'm looking for a 
  fight. And, oh, it's nothing personal.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(stands) Oh, no, I mean, you've been great.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>And fun catching up. I haven't really kept in contact with 
  many of my friends from high school. Guess I'll be looking them up pretty 
  soon. (laughs)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(looks down) Yeah.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Hey, I don't mean to be Count Buttinsky here, but you just 
  don't seem as thrilled. Is it because we're gonna fight?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>'S 'cause I'm gonna win.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>(laughs) Hello. Two years of Tae Kwon Do and vampire 
  strength. I think somebody's counting their chickens.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>You're not leaving this graveyard. (shrugs) Can't let 
  ya.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Do the words "superiority complex" mean anything to 
  you?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>You think I'm gonna let you go kill a bunch of people? You 
  know I'm sworn to—</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>No, no. I get the battle against evil. That's not the 
  issue—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>There is no issue. Don't issue me.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Just answer me this: whose fault was your parents 
  divorce?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(rolls eyes) OK, you know, this is beyond evil. This is 
  insane troll logic. What do my parents have to do with—?</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>(sits on sarcophagus) I'm just curious. Your opinion.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(sighs, sits on sarcophagus next to him) They both have a 
  lot of—</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Off the top of your head.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(hangs head) My dad. </p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Uh-huh. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>He cheated. Um, I think he cheated.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>So, of all of these relationships of yours—that you knew 
  subconsciously were totally doomed—Whose fault is that?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>It's incredibly different.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>I was just wondering, (stands) is it possible, even a 
  little bit, that the reason you have trouble connecting to guys is because you 
  think maybe they're not worth it? Maybe you think you're better than them.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>(glares) Say, there's that bloodlust I was looking for.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Struck a nerve.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>I'm gonna strike a nerve cluster in a minute, you don't get 
  off this. I don't remember you being this annoying.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>You don't remember me at all.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>Yes, I do.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Yeah, like, after 30 minutes of reminding. And I don't 
  take it personally because clearly you were in your own little world in high 
  school. All chosen. All destiny. Who could live with that for seven years and 
  not feel superior?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>I'm not. My God, if anything, I— (hangs head)</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>What?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>I just—(sighs) if you knew what I've done, what I've let 
  myself become. My best friends don't even—You'd laugh, you heard some of the 
  things I've done to them.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>(sits on nearby headstone) Buffy, I'm here to kill you, 
  not to judge you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>The last guy I was with, it got really— I behaved like a 
  monster, treated him like— But at the same time, I-I let him completely take 
  me over. Do things to me that— (starts to cry, Holden stands) I'm sorry. 
  (wipes eyes) Wow, I didn't mean to get all true-confessions there. I don't 
  know what's wrong with me.</p>

<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>There's nothing wrong with you. </p>

  BASEMENT AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>Jonathan and Andrew are digging up the 
  dirt in the room. </b></p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>We almost got this thing uncovered. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>Yep. </p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>I hope Buffy'll know how to destroy it. (stops digging) 
  36-19-27! That's it! That was my locker combination. (digs) God, it's been 
  bugging me all night.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>Dude, we spent the last few years trying to forget about 
  high school. Why are you trying so hard to remember it? </p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>I don't know. I guess I miss it. Don't you?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>Yeah, I really miss it. </p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>(stops digging) No, I'm serious. I really miss it. Time 
  goes by, and everything drops away. (Andrew stops digging, looks at Jonathan) 
  All the cruelty, all the pain, all that humiliation. It all washes away. </p>
<p><i>Andrew looks over Jonathan's shoulder and sees Warren standing there, 
  staring at him.</i></p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>I miss my friends. I miss my enemies. I miss the people 
  I talked to every day. I miss the people who never knew I existed. I miss 'em 
  all. I want to talk to them, you know. I want to find out how they're doing. I 
  want to know what's going on in their lives. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>You know what? They don't wanna talk to you—all those 
  people you just mentioned. Not one of them is sitting around going, "I wonder 
  what Jonathan's up to right now." Not one of them cares about you. </p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>Well, I still care about them. That's why I'm here. </p>
<p><i>Jonathan goes back to digging, and Andrew follows suit. Pan out to show 
  that they are uncovering a 6-foot wide circular object made of metal molded 
  into the shape of an inverted pentagram with a horned goat head symbol on it.

  LIVING ROOM AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>Dawn's sitting Indian-style on the 
  living room floor, surrounded by white candles and thick books. She's got one 
  of the books open to a specific page. The strange breathing sound is still 
  present.</b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>I know you're there. I will cast you out. My mother needs to 
  talk to me. </p>
<p><i>Dawn's holding a bowl and sprinkles dust from the bowl on the ground in 
  front of her. A force pushes her backwards across the room. She stops when her 
  back hits the wall, but she's still got the bowl in her lap.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>I cast you from this place. (sprinkles dust) It is your 
  poison and your bane. (sprinkles dust)</p>
<p><i>Something scratches Dawn's face, leaving a bloody gash, and she screams. 
  </i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>(sprinkles dust) It is the skin that is cut from your flesh! 
  </p>
<p><i>A strong wind blows out all the candles. The living room window explodes 
  inward, shattering pieces of glass all over her and the room.</i></p>

  AT SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHT<br/>Buffy's sitting on the steps inside the 
  crypt, talking to Holden, who's sitting beside her.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>And the joke is... he loved me. I mean, in his own sick, 
  soulless way, he really did care for me. But I-I didn't want to be loved.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Didn't you?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>I have all this power. I didn't ask for it. I don't deserve 
  it. It's like... I wanted to be punished. I wanted to hurt like I thought I 
  deserved. I sorta think—you know, this is, um, complicated. If you'd rather 
  just fight...</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>(leans back) Tell me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>I feel like I'm worse than anyone. Honestly, I'm beneath 
  them. My friends, my boyfriends. I feel like I'm not worthy of their love. 
  'Cause even though they love me, it doesn't mean anything 'cause their 
  opinions don't matter. They don't know. They haven't been through what I've 
  been through. They're not the slayer. I am. Sometimes I feel—(sighs) this is 
  awful—I feel like I'm better than them. Superior.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Until you can't win. And I thought I was diabolical—or, at 
  least I plan to be. You do have a superiority complex. And you've got an 
  inferiority complex about it. (laughs) Kudos.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>It doesn't make any sense. </p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>(sits forward) Oh, it makes every kind of sense. And it 
  all adds up to you feeling alone. But, Buffy, everybody feels alone. Everybody 
  is, until you die. Speaking of...(stands) you ready for our little death 
  match?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>I suppose. (stands) Thanks, for listening.</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Oh, you know, there's some things you can only tell a 
  stranger. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>You're not a stranger. That stuff with Spike is pretty—</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Hold it. </p>

<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>Did you say Spike?</p>

<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>I cast you out with every prayer from every god that walked 
  the Earth and crawled beneath. (thrown across the room, landing on her butt,

  who love me. (stands) I cast your out with the strength I have inside me! I 
  cast you out into the void. (throws bowl forward) That's right! Die, you 
  bastard!</p>
<p><i>The noise and wind stop. Blood spatters all the walls, but then fades 
  and disappears altogether. The house is a complete wreck, but still now. 
  Dawn whimpers and collapses. A golden light fills the room. Dawn looks up and 
  sees a vision of Joyce standing there in front of her, beautiful and glowing, 
  wearing a long white gown. Dawn manages to push herself up on her arms and sit

<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>That's why I came. We needed to warn you. </p>

  like it was just as dangerous for me to quit completely, like I'll go off the 
  deep end again—</p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>You can't. If you do so much as another spell—</p>

<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>Don't think that way. </p>

  all my friends. I'm not strong. I'm not an Amazon. I'm just me.</p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>Well, there is one thing—one thing you could do to stop

<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>That's what you want, isn't it? </p>
