  Congratulations.<br/>Xander and Anya kissing.<br/>Buffy in the Double Meat 
  Palace.<br/>BUFFY: Double meat is double sweet. Enjoy.<br/>DAWN: Hey

<p>Open on exterior shot of the Double Meat Palace, night.<br/>TODD VOICEOVER: 
  You see, Buffy... 
  <p>Cut to inside. Close shot of the grill. 
  <p>TODD VOICEOVER: ...the thing you gotta learn about the Palace, and this 
  takes a while... 
  <p>Pan over to where a scraper is scraping the grease from the top of the 
  grill. A bucket of grease sits beside it. Todd, a young man about Buffy's age, 
  is leaning against the wall nearby. 
  <p>TODD: ...is that job security all boils down to one simple thing. 
  <p>Reveal Buffy, doing the scraping. She looks over at Todd expectantly. 
  <p>TODD: Politics. 
  <p>Beat. Buffy resumes scraping. 
  <p>TODD: Now, I'm not a political animal, but you learn fast around here or 
  it's wham! Hello glass ceiling. 
  <p>Buffy makes a face as she lifts a spatula-ful of grease. Todd tips the 
  bucket so she can dump the grease into it. She resumes scraping. 
  <p>TODD: I mean, it's not like we work at Burger World, or the Happy Bun, 
  where the power structure is simple. No, here at the Palace, you gotta keep 
  your friends close, but your enemies? Closer. (Buffy nodding, rolling her 
  eyes) It's like Machiavelli says. (Buffy looks confused) You know Machiavelli, 
  right?<br/>BUFFY: Tall guy, bleached mullet, works day shifts?<br/>TODD: 
  (laughs) I'm sorry. My bad. I keep forgetting you dropped out of 
  college.<br/>BUFFY: I'm reapplying.<br/>TODD: (patronizing) Good luck with that. 
  Well, gotta motor! (picks up a backpack) Don't wanna be late for night 
  school.<br/>BUFFY: You go to night school?<br/>TODD: I'm working on my MBA. 
  Think I wanna spend the rest of my life cleaning grease traps? (shakes head) 
  Ooh, don't forget to lock up before you go, and the gum under the tables? Be 
  sure to give it a good scrape before you leave.<br/>BUFFY: (sarcastic) May 
  I?<br/>TODD: (leaving) See you tomorrow!<br/>BUFFY: (to herself) Yes, you will. 
  And the day after that, (sighs) and the day after that, and the day after 
  that... 
  <p>Cut to the graveyard, later. Buffy walks along holding a small paper bag 
  with the Double Meat logo. She wears a long caramel-colored coat over her 
  clothes. 
  <p>BUFFY: (sings) 'Get the double treat, that's the double sweet, oh it's hard 
  to beat, when the meat meets-' Oh, why can't I get this stupid jingle out of 
  my head? 
  <p>A vampire jumps out in front of her. 
  <p>VAMP: Least of your problems now, little girl.<br/>BUFFY: Wait. 
  <p>She turns to put the bag down carefully on a nearby headstone. 
  <p>VAMP: Ooookay.<br/>BUFFY: (turns back) Okay, let's do this. (points at him) 
  Quickly. 
  <p>The vamp swings at her. She ducks, then punches him. He reels aside and 
  kicks her. He grabs her by the upper arms and pulls her toward him, moving to 
  bite her neck as she struggles to shove him away. 
  <p>Then the vampire pulls back, still holding her. 
  <p>VAMP: What's that smell? (sniffing) Geez, Slayer, is that you?<br/>BUFFY: 
  I've been working!<br/>VAMP: Where, in a slaughterhouse?!<br/>BUFFY: (pouts) 
  Double Meat Palace.<br/>VAMP: Ohhh. 
  <p>He lets go and backs away. 
  <p>VAMP: You know what? Let's just call it a night. (Buffy looking surprised) 
  If it's all the same to you, and you've been eating that stuff, I'm not so 
  sure I wanna bite you.<br/>BUFFY: You're dead! You smell like it! (vamp 
  shrugging and nodding) How do you get to say I'm the one who's stinky? 
  (pouting)<br/>VAMP: Really, it's, it's cool, I'll just catch you next time. 
  <p>A stake flies into the shot and into his heart. He groans and dusts. 
  <p>Buffy looks triumphant for a moment, then lowers her head to sniff herself. 
  She makes a face, picks up her take-out bag and walks off. 
  <p>Wolf howl. Opening credits. 
  <p>Special Guest Star Marc Blucas. Guest starring Ivana Milicevic. Written and 
  directed by Douglas Petrie.

<b>Act I</b><br/>
<hr align="left" width="100"/>
<p>Open on exterior of the Summers house, night. Buffy walks up the walkway 
  holding her paper bag, sighing. 
  <p>She pauses right before the stairs. 
  <p>BUFFY: Oh, for pete's sake. Spike? 
  <p>She turns. Spike appears from behind a nearby tree. 
  <p>SPIKE: Ah, it's a fair cop, you caught me, Slayer. However, in all honesty, 
  I think we have to say this one doesn't count. After all, I wasn't exactly 
  hiding. (walks toward her)<br/>BUFFY: No, Spike.<br/>SPIKE: No? What kind of 
  answer is that, you haven't even heard the question yet.<br/>BUFFY: I don't 
  have to. We both know what you're thinking.<br/>SPIKE: (grins) And we both know 
  ... that I'm not the only one thinking it. 
  <p>He puts his hand out as if to grab her coat collar, and leans in as if to 
  kiss her. 
  <p>Buffy slaps his hand away. 
  <p>BUFFY: No! Not here.<br/>SPIKE: Why not? (pouting)<br/>BUFFY: Dawn. (looks 
  toward the house) She's inside waiting for dinner, she's counting on me. I'm 
  not letting her down by letting you in.<br/>SPIKE: So it's the fear of getting 
  caught, then, is it?<br/>BUFFY: Reason number one on a very long list. (turns 
  to go)<br/>SPIKE: Needn't be an obstacle. 
  <p>He takes her hand and pulls her toward the tree. Longer shot of the two of 
  them moving along the side of the building. 
  <p>BUFFY: (sighs) Spike, I mean it. Come on.<br/>SPIKE: I hear you're serious. 
  So am I. I want you ... you want me... 
  <p>Cut to a closer shot as Buffy has her back up against the tree and Spike is 
  right in her face. 
  <p>SPIKE: ...I can't go inside, so ... maybe the time is right ... for you to 
  come outside. 
  <p>Buffy sighs, looks at the house, then back at Spike. He slowly leans in to 
  kiss her. 
  <p>Cut to a long shot again. They kiss, Buffy drops the paper bag on the 
  ground, and Spike pulls her around so that the tree obscures them from our 
  view. 
  <p>Cut to inside. Buffy comes into the kitchen, holding the paper bag and 
  putting her other hand to her forehead. She stops and looks surprised. 
  <p>BUFFY: Dawn. 
  <p>We see Dawn by the refrigerator, looking in. She closes it and turns to 
  Buffy. 
  <p>BUFFY: Hey, hi.<br/>DAWN: Rough night?<br/>BUFFY: The usual. I-I brought you 
  dinner. 
  <p>Buffy hands the paper bag to Dawn across the kitchen island, which is 
  otherwise bare. Buffy sits. 
  <p>DAWN: Oh, great. (opening bag) Oh. 
  <p>Dawn takes out a paper-wrapped sandwich and smiles bravely. 
  <p>BUFFY: I-I know it's not the most original these days, but ... I made it 
  myself. I-I made hundreds, actually, but this is the, the very best 
  one.<br/>DAWN: It ... looks kinda squished.<br/>BUFFY: Oh, well just, you know, 
  just... (takes the sandwich and slaps it lightly a few times) give it a sec. 
  (Dawn looking disgusted) Yeah, these babies really bounce back. Literally. 
  <p>She gives the sandwich back. Dawn looks at it, then at her. 
  <p>DAWN: Buffy ... it's not like I don't appreciate it, I do. It's just that 
  ... (softly) I can't eat this stuff another night. I'm sorry.<br/>BUFFY: (fake 
  cheer) Oh! No, it, it's all good. I get it. (taking the sandwich back) Tell 
  you what, tomorrow night, I'll, uh, I'll bring home the fisherman's nuggets 
  with cheese. 
  <p>Dawn looks less than thrilled. Willow enters. 
  <p>WILLOW: Hey, workin' lady. Rough night?<br/>BUFFY: Why does everybody keep 
  asking me that?<br/>WILLOW: Uh, no reason, I just ... thought you were busy 
  with the slayage 'cause of that grass stain. (pointing to Buffy's jacket) 
  <p>Buffy tries to look at the back of her jacket, looks upset, takes it off to 
  look at it. 
  <p>DAWN: Some vamp get rough with you?<br/>BUFFY: (examining coat, muttering) 
  He's not getting any gentler.<br/>WILLOW: He?<br/>BUFFY: (quickly) They. Them. 
  You know. (Willow and Dawn looking at her) Vampires in the, in the ... general 
  population sense. (looks at jacket, sighs) Now I'm gonna have to wash 
  this.<br/>WILLOW: (smiling) Ready for a bold suggestion? (smiling at Dawn, then 
  at Buffy) Blow it off! Dawnie and I are headed out to the Bronze.<br/>DAWN: Um, 
  do I have your permission and wanna come along? (grinning) You like how I 
  slipped in that permission request like that?<br/>WILLOW: Very 
  smooth.<br/>BUFFY: You guys go.<br/>DAWN: Really?<br/>WILLOW: Buffy, are you 
  sure? I-it might do you good to get away from the Double Meat lifestyle for a 
  night. See your friends.<br/>DAWN: Who'd love to see you.<br/>BUFFY: I'm sure. 
  I've seen enough action for one night. (to Dawn) Home by eleven?<br/>DAWN: 
  (smiles) On the dot.<br/>BUFFY: Have a good time. 
  <p>Dawn smiles, and she and Willow exit. Buffy picks up the still-wrapped 
  sandwich and stares at it. 
  <p>BUFFY: (to herself) Somebody should. 
  <p>She sighs, puts the sandwich back in the bag. 
  <p>Cut to the Bronze. Pan across various people drinking and dancing, 
  bartender serving. Reveal Xander and Anya sitting at the bar eating chips from 
  several bags. A notebook sits in front of them bearing the wedding seating 
  chart. 
  <p>ANYA: See ... this seating chart makes no sense. We have to do it again. 
  (Xander nodding) We can't do it again. You do it.<br/>XANDER: The seating 
  chart's fine. Let's get back to the table arrangements. I'm starting to have 
  dreams of gardenia bouquets. (winces) I am so glad my manly coworkers didn't 
  just hear me say that. (eating chips)<br/>ANYA: Will you stop wolfing down 
  those chips? One more bag and you'll pop right out of your cummerbund. 
  <p>She grabs the bag of chips away from him, looks in it and sticks her hand 
  in. Xander looks upset. 
  <p>ANYA: You're not even hungry, you're just nervous.<br/>XANDER: (smacking the 
  bar-top) Yeah! Wedding, one week! We have friends, family, demons flying in, a 
  to-do list getting no shorter, and do NOT- (grabs the bag back) -take my 
  chips. 
  <p>They stare at each other angrily. Dawn comes over, holding two plastic 
  cups. 
  <p>DAWN: Hey guys! How's the soon-to-be-newlyweds? Nervous?<br/>ANYA/XANDER: 
  No!<br/>DAWN: (dubious) Okay. I'll just be over here then. 
  <p>Dawn goes over to where Willow is fiddling with pool cues. 
  <p>DAWN: Your Arnold Palmer, milady. (gives Willow a drink)<br/>WILLOW: Thanks. 
  So how are Mr. and Mrs. High-Strung?<br/>DAWN: I'm betting they 
  explode.<br/>WILLOW: You know, when I was little, I used to spend hours 
  imagining what my wedding to Xander would be like. And now I look at them... 
  (shot of Anya and Xander at the bar) I just think... (mocking laugh) 
  "Nee-hee-hee!"<br/>DAWN: (giggles) You're awfully chipper tonight.<br/>WILLOW: 
  (smiling) Can't hide it.<br/>DAWN: Hmm. Big wedding coming up ... lots of date 
  possibilities ... you and Tara are speaking again. You wanna call her? Invite 
  her over?<br/>WILLOW: Oh, no. Too soon for so bold a maneuver. (smiles) But if 
  I did call? She wouldn't hang up on me.<br/>DAWN: That's progress!<br/>WILLOW: 
  (smiling) Hence the happy. 
  <p>Cut to: Buffy's basement. An old boom-box is playing a sad country song. 
  Buffy is wearing an old t-shirt and has her coat on the ironing board, rubbing 
  it with a rag. She pauses, looks at the grass stain, resumes rubbing. 
  <p>Cut to upstairs. Buffy is asleep on the sofa, with the coat covering her. 
  It's daylight. Sound of a noisy truck engine from outside. Buffy slowly wakes 
  up. 
  <p>BUFFY: Garbage! Uhh... 
  <p>She leaps up, pulling the jacket on. 
  <p>Cut to the street. The garbage truck is pulling away. 
  <p>BUFFY: (OS) Wait! Wait up, guys! 
  <p>The truck drives off, revealing Buffy behind it, running down the walk with 
  a garbage bag in each hand. 
  <p>BUFFY: Wait! 
  <p>She stands there panting, watching the truck turn a corner. 
  <p>BUFFY: (whining) Don't you want your garbage? 
  <p>She sighs, pouts, turns and walks back toward the house. 
  <p>Cut to the kitchen. Buffy enters through the back door, holding a pile of 
  mail. She begins looking through it. We see Dawn standing by the island. 
  <p>DAWN: Hey Buffy. Oh, don't forget, today's trash day.<br/>BUFFY: (sourly) 
  Thanks. 
  <p>Dawn piles her books into her school bag. Buffy opens a letter. 
  <p>Close shot of the letter. 
  <p>
<blockquote><code>Dear Ms. Summers, 
    <p>We are sorry to reject your application for re-admittance to UCSD.<br/>Our

<p>BUFFY: (OS) 'Dear Ms. Summers, we are sorry to reject...'<br/>DAWN: What's 
  that?<br/>BUFFY: (folding the letter) Nothing.<br/>DAWN: Huh. Bronze was fun 
  last night. In a total home-by-eleven-ish way. You should have come.<br/>BUFFY: 
  Well, next time. (looks at Dawn) Where are you going?<br/>DAWN: 
  School?<br/>BUFFY: (duh) Oh. That's good. Uh, don't you want breakfast 
  first?<br/>DAWN: Already made it. See you this afternoon? Unless you're 
  working. (coming around the island toward Buffy) Tonight then. Or, you know, 
  tomorrow's cool. Don't work too hard. 
  <p>Dawn kisses Buffy on the cheek. Buffy smiles. 
  <p>BUFFY: Bye. 
  <p>Dawn exits. Buffy looks at the kitchen sink, piled high with dirty dishes. 
  She stops smiling, makes a face, sighs. Removes her jacket and turns to the 
  sink. 
  <p>Cut to: close shot of the Double Meat grill with nine burgers cooking. A 
  spatula flipping them over. 
  <p>TODD: (OS) And that's where even your best political minds can drop the 
  ball. 
  <p>Reveal Buffy flipping the burgers, wearing the uniform, while Todd stands 
  behind her eating one. 
  <p>TODD: Zeitgeist! You're not taking the pulse of the public, the next thing 
  you know you're LBJ handing the house keys over to Nixon. (turns to his work) 
  Heard back from your college yet?<br/>BUFFY: Yeah.<br/>TODD: All right. You 
  know, we're out of special sauce.<br/>BUFFY: I'll get it.<br/>TODD: No no. Your 
  turn up front. I'll deal back here. You take the customers. 
  <p>Buffy looks less than thrilled. She turns and walks off. 
  <p>Cut to the counter. Buffy walks up to the cash register. 
  <p>BUFFY: Welcome to the Double Meat Palace, how may I help... 
  <p>She pauses as she sees who it is. 
  <p>Reveal Riley, standing there dressed all in black with a bulletproof vest 
  on. 
  <p>BUFFY: You. 
  <p>Closer shot on Riley. We see that he has a long scar running from his 
  forehead across one eye and down his cheek. His expression is grim. 
  <p>RILEY: Hey.<br/>BUFFY: Huh?<br/>Blackout. 
  <p>
<hr align="left" width="100"/>
<b>Act II</b><br/>
<hr align="left" width="100"/>
<p>Same scene. Buffy stares up at Riley. 
  <p>BUFFY: Riley.<br/>RILEY: Sorry to just drop in on you like this, 
  Buffy.<br/>BUFFY: It's you.<br/>RILEY: It's me.<br/>BUFFY: You're here.<br/>RILEY: 
  I know.<br/>BUFFY: And ... were you always this tall?<br/>RILEY: (leans closer) 
  Look, this isn't the way I wanted it. But something's come up, something big. 
  We don't have much time. You understand?<br/>BUFFY: (nodding) Not a work you've 
  said so far.<br/>RILEY: Right. I should have known, anticipated. You're 
  working. 
  <p>Longer shot of the restaurant interior. There are a few customers waiting 
  in line behind Riley. Buffy is the only person working the counter.<br/>Cut 
  back to close shot. 
  <p>BUFFY: Well, just counter, not grill any more.<br/>RILEY: I want to explain, 
  I just don't have time. I've been up for 48 hours straight tracking something 
  bad, and now it's come to Sunnydale.<br/>BUFFY: My hat has a cow.<br/>RILEY: 
  (sighs) I know that I'm putting you on the spot, showing up like this, but ... 
  but you know, here we are. I need the best. I need you, Buffy. (Buffy staring 
  at him) Can you help me? 
  <p>Todd appears, sticks his face next to Buffy's. 
  <p>TODD: Hellooo, Buffy? People are waiting. 
  <p>Buffy and Riley stare at each other, oblivious to Todd. 
  <p>Buffy takes off her Double Meat hat, puts it down, grabs a black coat from 
  under the counter, and comes out from behind the counter to join Riley. 
  <p>TODD: Buffy, uh ... Buffy! Wait! Buffy! 
  <p>Buffy follows Riley out. 
  <p>Cut to the street. Buffy (wearing her black coat over her uniform) and 
  Riley walk along. 
  <p>RILEY: Look, I'm sorry this is all so sudden. You know, if we get a minute, 
  I'd really like to sit down... 
  <p>He stops as something on his belt begins to beep. He grabs it and looks at 
  it. 
  <p>BUFFY: What is it?<br/>RILEY: Suvolte demon. Rare, lethal ... nearly 
  extinct, but not nearly enough. (Buffy grinning) It's close. 
  <p>Buffy starts to laugh. 
  <p>RILEY: What?<br/>BUFFY: Sorry. It's just ... you still carry around all that 
  James Bond stuff. 
  <p>Close shot on the device in Riley's hand. It looks like a flip-open cell 
  phone except that instead of a digital display it has a red radar screen. Two 
  large blinking red dots show the movement of the demon. 
  <p>BUFFY: It's so cute! I forgot. 
  <p>Riley puts the device away, gives Buffy a look. 
  <p>BUFFY: Sorry. (fake-military) Carry on.<br/>RILEY: (resumes walking) We've 
  been tear-assing through every jungle from Paraguay up, taking out nests. As 
  soon as we put one Suvolte down, a dozen take its place. They're breeders, 
  Buffy. One turns into ten, ten becomes a hundred. This gets out of hand and 
  there's a war with humans? Humans are gonna lose.<br/>BUFFY: So they're like 
  really mean tribbles. (Riley gives her another look) Sorry, I've been dealing 
  with these, these geeks, it's, it's a whole thing. 
  <p>Sound of demon growling. They both look up. 
  <p>The demon, which looks like a cross between a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle 
  and the alien from "Alien," is across the street knocking over some newspaper 
  vending machines. People scream and run away. 
  <p>RILEY: You ready for this?<br/>BUFFY: Yes please. 
  <p>They both start forward. Riley holds up a badge. 
  <p>RILEY: (yelling) National Forestry Service, we got a wild bear! Everybody 
  stand back! (pushes a pedestrian aside) Look out! 
  <p>People run away as Riley approaches the demon. It hits him, slashing his 
  arm with a claw, and he reels back clutching his arm. Buffy jumps up onto the 
  demon's back and it flings her off against a wall, then it retreats into an 
  alley. 
  <p>A gun falls to the ground beside Buffy. She gets to her knees and picks it 
  up. Riley comes over and grabs her arm to help her up. They look at each 
  other. 
  <p>Buffy turns and heads toward the alley with Riley right behind. 
  <p>They walk cautiously down the alley, looking around. They reach a point 
  where the alley widens. 
  <p>RILEY: Split. 
  <p>Buffy nods. They move off in different directions. Suddenly a garbage can 
  flies into the shot, toward Riley, but he deflects it. Sound of the demon 
  growling. 
  <p>BUFFY: Riley! 
  <p>Buffy tosses him the gun. He takes aim at the demon, shoots it. The gun 
  shoots darts rather than bullets. The dart sticks in the demon's chest. It 
  roars and flails its arms around. Buffy runs at it and one of its arms hits 
  her. She reels back against Riley, who catches her. The demon leaps up to the 
  roof of the building and is gone. 
  <p>RILEY: You all right?<br/>BUFFY: I'll feel better when we catch it. But it's 
  too fast.<br/>RILEY: I wouldn't necessarily say that. 
  <p>Cut to the street. A very large SUV comes screeching around the corner. It 
  is black, of course. 
  <p>Cut to inside. Riley is driving while Buffy sits in the passenger seat. 
  <p>BUFFY: Nice wheels.<br/>RILEY: Came with the car.<br/>BUFFY: (smiles) Know 
  where we're goin'?<br/>RILEY: Got an idea. The tag's on-line. We'll find it. 
  <p>Shot of a GPS screen on the car's dashboard. It shows a blip for the demon 
  and another one for the car. 
  <p>BUFFY: How's your arm?<br/>RILEY: It'll heal. How you doin'?<br/>BUFFY: 
  Complicated question.<br/>RILEY: I just meant-<br/>BUFFY: I know.<br/>RILEY: I 
  hear ya. Got some, uh ... big stories to tell you to. If we ever get half a 
  second.<br/>BUFFY: Did you die?<br/>RILEY: No.<br/>BUFFY: I'm gonna win. 
  <p>Riley looks surprised. 
  <p>Buffy takes off her coat, revealing the bright red-and-white DoubleMeat 
  uniform. 
  <p>RILEY: Here. (grabs something from behind the seat and gives it to her) No 
  offense, but this is black ops, and you look like a pylon.<br/>BUFFY: (looks at 
  it) Ninja wear?<br/>RILEY: Battle gear. Lightweight Kevlar, state of the 
  art.<br/>BUFFY: What a surprise.<br/>RILEY: Boys like toys. Put it on, thank me 
  later.<br/>BUFFY: (smiling) You won't look?<br/>RILEY: (staring at the road 
  ahead) I'm a gentleman.<br/>BUFFY: Okay. (begins unfolding the clothes) So ... 
  the black-ops life, it's workin' out for ya?<br/>RILEY: Don't suck.<br/>BUFFY: 
  They got dental?<br/>RILEY: (smiles) Yeah, we're covered. 
  <p>Beat. They both look pensive. 
  <p>RILEY: You know, there's not many people I'd ask to risk their life for me, 
  Buffy. It's really good to see you.<br/>BUFFY: Thanks.<br/>RILEY: You're 
  welcome. And Buffy ... love the hair. 
  <p>Buffy smirks a little.<br/>Exterior shot of the car speeding down an 
  otherwise empty highway. 
  <p>Cut to exterior shot of a different highway, this one covered with cars 
  bumper-to-bumper, barely moving. Horns honking. 
  <p>ANYA VOICEOVER: I think we died in this car on the way to the airport, and 
  now we're stuck in hell. 
  <p>Cut to the interior of Xander's car. Xander is driving while Anya sits in 
  the passenger seat. Numerous bags of chips are on the dashboard. 
  <p>XANDER: The radio said no traffic. (reaching for chips)<br/>ANYA: It's a 
  hell radio, of course it said that. We'll never get to the airport in time to 
  pick up your stupid uncle.<br/>XANDER: It just gives my uncle Rory more time at 
  the bar. Trust me, he'll be happy.<br/>ANYA: (mouth full) Great. So he can 
  sleep off his drunken stupor on our newly re-upholstered couch.<br/>XANDER: He 
  can't afford a hotel.<br/>ANYA: Why are you defending him?<br/>XANDER: I'm not. 
  I hate my uncle. I hate my whole family. That's why I'm marrying you, to start 
  a new family. Have children, make them hate us, then one day they'll get 
  married, we'll sleep on their couch. It's the circle of life. 
  (smiling)<br/>ANYA: Well, the Gnarals are teleporting in in twenty minutes. If 
  I'm not there to greet them? Somebody's getting incinerated.<br/>XANDER: Why 
  did we ever agree to have your friends, who are demons, and my family, who are 
  monsters, stay at our place?<br/>ANYA: Well, I can only do so much, Xander. 
  Planning this marriage is like staging the invasion of Normandy.<br/>XANDER: 
  Without the laughs. We should have eloped.<br/>ANYA: No! I've been through too 
  much planning this wedding, and it is *going* to happen. It is going to be our 
  perfect, perfect day if I have to kill every one of our guests and half this 
  town to do it.<br/>XANDER: Mm. (looks at her bag of chips) Cool Ranch?<br/>ANYA: 
  Cajun Fiesta. 
  <p>Xander grabs the bag. 
  <p>Cut to Riley's SUV screeching to a halt on a side road. It's mostly rock, a 
  few scraggly trees. Riley and Buffy get out, come around to the front of the 
  car and start walking. Buffy is wearing the black "ninja wear." Black 
  long-sleeved turtleneck, black bulletproof vest, black pants, black tool-belt. 
  Her hair is pulled back into a neat ponytail. 
  <p>BUFFY: End of the line? (Riley shrugs) I don't see our demon.<br/>RILEY: 
  It's not here.<br/>BUFFY: Let me guess. 
  <p>They walk between some low stone buildings. Riley grins. 
  <p>They walk over to a fence and look down. We see that they're standing at 
  the top of a huge dam. Far below, we can see the water. Rough uncut stone 
  walls surround the platform at the bottom. 
  <p>BUFFY: Down we go?<br/>RILEY: Looks that way. (doing something with 
  equipment)<br/>BUFFY: That's a big first step. So, Mr. Finn, got an extra 
  jet-pack for a girl like me?<br/>RILEY: Sorry, fresh out of jet-packs. Looks 
  like we'll have to share. 
  <p>Riley attaches one end of a rappelling line to the fence. 
  <p>RILEY: This test line's built for one, so if we go together, we're not 
  hauling any gear. Just be you and me.<br/>BUFFY: I was never big on the 
  hardware anyway.<br/>RILEY: You hold onto me?<br/>BUFFY: (flirty) If that's what 
  it takes.<br/>RILEY: Come on. 
  <p>Riley lifts her up onto the fence. She looks into his eyes. 
  <p>BUFFY: Ready when you are, Agent Finn. 
  <p>She puts her arms around his shoulders and they start down. 
  <p>Long shot of the two of them descending along the side of the dam. 
  <p>They reach the bottom and stand on a stone platform with a low stone wall 
  at the edge. Riley detaches the line from his belt. They both start looking 
  around. They duck past a large pipe with a small trickle of water coming out. 
  Past it, the stone ledge opens out into a wider space with a ladder at one 
  wall. 
  <p>Riley walks past a door and the demon comes out of it, tackling him from 
  behind. He throws it off and ducks a swing of its arm. 
  <p>Buffy attacks the demon and gets thrown aside. She leans against the stone 
  wall and looks over her shoulder at Riley grappling with the demon. Buffy 
  kicks back at the demon and gets it off Riley. He punches it, it hits him. 
  Buffy kicks it again. It hits Riley and then Buffy, sending them both reeling 
  back. 
  <p>Riley attacks again and gets hit in the stomach. He leans over in pain. 
  <p>BUFFY: Riley! 
  <p>Buffy grabs him and uses him as leverage to lift both feet off the ground 
  and kick the demon back. It falls to the ground. 
  <p>Riley turns Buffy around and pushes her up against the wall. They both pant 
  and stare deeply at each other. 
  <p>Behind them, another black-clad figure rappels down from above, landing on 
  the stone floor nearby. It's a woman with long dark hair in a ponytail similar 
  to Buffy's. She looks over at them. 
  <p>WOMAN: Hey. 
  <p>Buffy and Riley break out of their moment, look at her as she approaches. 
  <p>WOMAN: (to Riley) Hey there. (to Buffy) What exactly are you doing with my 
  husband? 
  <p>Buffy stares at Riley in surprise. He looks a little 
  embarrassed.<br/>Blackout. 
  <p>
<hr align="left" width="100"/>
<b>Act III</b><br/>
<hr align="left" width="100"/>
<p>Same scene. Buffy stares at Riley. 
  <p>BUFFY: Husband? 
  <p>Riley nods. Buffy looks at the woman. 
  <p>BUFFY: Wife. 
  <p>The woman nods. 
  <p>BUFFY: And ... those aren't code names like Big Dog or Falcon or... (the 
  others looking dubious) I didn't think so.<br/>RILEY: Buffy, meet Sam. Sam, 
  Buffy.<br/>SAM: (sincerely) Pleasure.<br/>BUFFY: Demon. 
  <p>They all turn to see the demon behind Sam. It has gotten back up again. It 
  snarls at them. 
  <p>SAM: (grins) Mine. 
  <p>Sam approaches the demon and grabs both of its arms, kicks it, takes one 
  arm and hits it. 
  <p>Angle on Buffy and Riley watching, as fighting noises and demon growls 
  continue off-screen. 
  <p>BUFFY: She's good.<br/>RILEY: She's a special one. (shot of Sam punching the 
  demon furiously)<br/>BUFFY: How long have you been married?<br/>RILEY: Four 
  months almost.<br/>BUFFY: Mazel tov. Any children?<br/>RILEY: Buffy, I meant to 
  tell you. When the time was right. She caught up to us a hell of a lot faster 
  than I would've guessed possible. She does that. (shot of Sam kicking and 
  punching the demon)<br/>BUFFY: So, you-you guys do this often, you know, the 
  whole ... husband-and-wife tag-team demon fighting thing?<br/>RILEY: Yeah, it's 
  what brought us together. I almost feel sorry for the Suvolte. 
  <p>The demon hits Sam across the face and she goes down. 
  <p>RILEY: But not quite. 
  <p>Riley moves forward, picking up a taser(?) from the ground. He catches the 
  demon's arm as it prepares to hit Sam, hits it in the stomach with the taser. 
  Sam crouches on the ground, kicks the demon back. 
  <p>Buffy stands there looking pensive as the other two continue fighting the 
  demon. 
  <p>The demon flings them both off and Buffy wakes up, rejoins the fight. Sam 
  is holding the demon's arm and kicking it. Buffy grabs the demon by its head. 
  <p>BUFFY: Call this your wedding gift. 
  <p>She twists the head, snapping the demon's neck. It falls to the ground. 
  <p>Riley moves forward as if to stop her but sees it's too late. Sam looks 
  shocked. 
  <p>BUFFY: (panting) So, guess that's mission accomplished. (turns 
  away)<br/>RILEY: (kneels by the demon) She killed it.<br/>SAM: Oh, honey ... 
  (putting a hand on his back, panting) That's okay.<br/>BUFFY: (turns back) 
  Okay? Wait ... you guys have been tracking this thing as a couple for two days 
  straight, and you ... did want it dead, right? 
  <p>Riley stands up again next to Sam. They look at each other nervously. 
  <p>BUFFY: Oh.<br/>SAM: Let me guess. Captain Can-Do over here (pointing her 
  thumb at Riley) forgot to mention that this was a homing operation. (Riley 
  looking embarrassed, getting something from his belt) But it's nice to finally 
  meet you, by the way. Knife. 
  <p>Sam puts out her hand without looking, and Riley gives her a large knife. 
  She kneels beside the demon. 
  <p>BUFFY: What is a homing operation?<br/>RILEY: It's my fault. I should have 
  explained.<br/>BUFFY: That would have saved me some ... trouble. 
  <p>Sam slices open the demon's stomach with the knife. Thick yellow blood 
  oozes out. 
  <p>SAM: Damn. 
  <p>Buffy makes a disgusted face. Sam stands up. 
  <p>SAM: We're too late. Finn ... how could you recruit the Slayer without 
  filling her in on the objective?<br/>BUFFY: That'd be my question.<br/>SAM: 
  (teasing) If we weren't under severe time constraints I'd seriously think 
  about ripping you a new one.<br/>RILEY: (smirking) Stand down, 
  soldier.<br/>BUFFY: He's your boss, too?<br/>SAM: (smirking) Oh, he wishes. We 
  better regroup. Buffy, I hate to impose further, but ... you got a safe 
  house?<br/>BUFFY: I, I have a house. I-I think it's safe. Sometimes you can't 
  even leave. 
  <p>Buffy grins. The others look confused. 
  <p>RILEY: (to Sam) I know the way. (to Buffy) And I'll fill you in. On 
  everything. 
  <p>Buffy nods. 
  <p>Cut to the Summers house, foyer, night. Buffy enters through the front 
  door, followed by Sam and Riley. 
  <p>BUFFY: Sorry the place is such a mess. I haven't had a chance to give it a 
  good cleaning. 
  <p>Reveal Dawn standing in the living-room doorway, arms folded. 
  <p>RILEY: Hey.<br/>DAWN: Agent Finn returns.<br/>RILEY: Dawn. Geez, look at you. 
  I think you grew a foot and a half.<br/>DAWN: (sullen) A lot can happen in a 
  year.<br/>RILEY: (chastised) Well, it's good to see you. 
  <p>Willow and Xander appear from the kitchen. 
  <p>XANDER: Hey, there's the man! Life taker, heartbreaker. (shakes Riley's 
  hand) You know, figuratively speaking.<br/>RILEY: Xander, Sam. 
  Willow...<br/>SAM: Hi. (all waving at each other)<br/>RILEY: Hi. (hugs 
  Willow)<br/>WILLOW: We got your call.<br/>XANDER: We're here to help. Just like 
  old times. Except, with you being all big with the married life.<br/>RILEY: 
  Hear you're getting hitched yourself. Believe me, you're gonna love it. (Sam 
  smiling at him)<br/>WILLOW: Congratulations, really, both of you. 
  <p>They all move into the living room. Buffy hangs back, and Willow goes to 
  her. 
  <p>WILLOW: (softly) Just so you know? I'm prepared to hate this woman any way 
  you want. (shot of Riley and Sam talking closely)<br/>BUFFY: Thanks, but no. I 
  don't wanna seem all petty.<br/>WILLOW: Well, that's the beauty! You can't, but 
  I can. Please. Let me carry the hate for the both of us. 
  <p>Another shot of the Finns. They are laughing together, touching each other 
  lightly. 
  <p>BUFFY: Go nuts. 
  <p>Buffy and Willow exchange a nod, proceed into the living room. Dawn and 
  Xander remain standing by the doorway. Dawn still has her arms crossed and her 
  expression says that she is still mad at Riley. 
  <p>DAWN: So. What brings you back to town after you left suddenly with no 
  word? 
  <p>Riley, Sam, Buffy, and Willow sit. 
  <p>RILEY: Sam and I have been tracking a Suvolte demon through Central 
  America. Killing machine. Nearly mature.<br/>SAM: Yeah, three months old and 
  growing fast.<br/>RILEY: These things start to kill the minute they're hatched. 
  And leave a real clear trail.<br/>SAM: Yeah. Just follow the villages with 
  nothing in them but body parts.<br/>RILEY: Uh ... Dawn, are you sure you wanna 
  be around hearing all this?<br/>SAM: Oh, come on, Finn, she looks all grown-up 
  to me. (to Buffy) That is, if it's all right with you.<br/>BUFFY: Uh, sure, 
  yeah, it's fine.<br/>DAWN: So, this demon shredded your guys, and now you're 
  looking for a little payback?<br/>SAM: (shakes head) No. It came here to the 
  Hellmouth to, to spawn. (sighs) But we think it already hatched its eggs 
  somewhere.<br/>RILEY: And the plan was to track it. Let the demon take us to 
  its nest.<br/>DAWN: And ... now they're gonna hatch a bunch of ... baby demon 
  things?<br/>SAM: Unless we stop it.<br/>BUFFY: Which means we have to find the 
  nest, and fast, before Sunnydale turns into the Trouble Meat Palace. 
  <p>Beat. Everyone looks at Buffy. 
  <p>BUFFY: I wish I'd said something else.<br/>XANDER: Okay, so we track down 
  the demon, find the nest, Mr. and Mrs. Finn here make with the killin', and 
  everyone goes home happy. (sits on the sofa beside Sam) But seriously, married 
  man. If forced to choose between a photographer and place settings-<br/>BUFFY: 
  We can't track the demon. (they look at her) I killed it. (chipper) So! Who's 
  hungry? We got, uh-<br/>DAWN: Ice cubes.<br/>BUFFY: All you can eat.<br/>SAM: 
  Buffy? It's good that you killed the Suvolte before it killed us. (to Xander) 
  Disposable cameras.<br/>XANDER: Di - wah?<br/>SAM: Yeah, you, you know, little 
  plastic ones, ten bucks a pop. You arrange them like table settings, guests 
  snap photos... 
  <p>Buffy looks at them. Close shot on Riley's hand resting on Sam's knee. She 
  puts her own hand over Riley's, lacing their fingers together. 
  <p>SAM: ...breaks the ice, and when the wedding's over, you get to take home 
  the pictures.<br/>XANDER: (grinning) I like it! 
  <p>Shot of Willow and Buffy. Buffy stares at the floor while Willow makes 
  snide faces at Sam. 
  <p>Riley and Sam smile at Xander, turn back to Buffy. Willow makes an innocent 
  face. 
  <p>BUFFY: So, demon eggs. Any timetable on when they're gonna hatch?<br/>RILEY: 
  Hatching's not the problem.<br/>SAM: We think they're gonna be sold on the 
  black market. There are some foreign military powers that would love to have 
  their own Suvolte. You could never train it, but drop it on an urban 
  population...<br/>RILEY: And it cleanses the area.<br/>DAWN: Is that a nice way 
  of saying it kills people?<br/>SAM: Lots of 'em. Money's been exchanged. 
  There's a dealer in town, calls himself the, The Doctor. Willow, you think you 
  can help with a little locating spell?<br/>WILLOW: (quietly) I can't do the 
  magicks.<br/>SAM: Oh, Riley says you're comin' on as one major-league 
  Wicca.<br/>WILLOW: I got addicted. The way addicts do. 
  <p>Willow exits toward the kitchen. Sam looks upset. 
  <p>RILEY: Two teams. No civilians. I'll, uh ... I'll go out and look for our 
  Doctor. You two find that nest.<br/>BUFFY: Me and Sam together?<br/>RILEY: You 
  come across a Suvolte nest, you're gonna want backup.<br/>SAM: You know, I 
  don't wanna be dragging down the Slayer. (to Buffy) You've got speed, and 
  power I can't even-<br/>BUFFY: Let's go. Xander, are you okay to stay with 
  Dawn?<br/>XANDER: Yeah.<br/>RILEY: I'll check out some bars. Willy's, some, uh, 
  crypts that I know. 
  <p>Everyone gets up. 
  <p>Cut to the kitchen. Willow sits by the island looking pensive. Sam enters. 
  <p>SAM: Hey Willow. I'm sorry, I think I really ... stepped in it in there. 
  (Willow not looking at her) You know, back in the jungle ... we had not one, 
  but two hard-core shamans working for us ... they were working the dark 
  magicks, and ... got addicted. And now they're gone. (Willow turns to look at 
  her) Gone ... as in ... there's nothing left. I've never met anyone with 
  enough strength to quit before. 
  <p>Willow continues looking at her, says nothing. 
  <p>SAM: I'm just saying. 
  <p>Sam turns and leaves. Willow watches her go, smiles a little.<br/>SAM 
  VOICEOVER: Thanks for letting me tag along. 
  <p>Cut to the graveyard, night. Sam and Buffy walk along, still wearing their 
  all-black outfits. 
  <p>BUFFY: No problem.<br/>SAM: Maybe not for you. I gotta tell you, Buffy, I'm 
  a little bit intimidated. I mean, patrolling with the real live Slayer, you're 
  like ... Santa Claus, or Buddha, or something.<br/>BUFFY: Fat and 
  jolly?<br/>SAM: Legendary. And it's not just slayer status I'm talking about. 
  It's you.<br/>BUFFY: Riley talks about me?<br/>SAM: He didn't say anything for a 
  long time, but I could tell. He was ripped up inside.<br/>BUFFY: Good thing he 
  has you.<br/>SAM: More like miraculous. I went down to Central America with the 
  Peace Corps. One night, my entire infirmary got slaughtered by... (shakes her 
  head) I didn't know what they were. I got saved, quit the Corps, joined the 
  squad. My first firefight, I met Riley. (smiling) We started talking, you 
  know, first about tactics, missions, stuff like that. And then about 
  you.<br/>BUFFY: He thinks ... I let him go.<br/>SAM: (stops) Do you wish you 
  hadn't.<br/>BUFFY: (softly) I wish things were different. I-I'm not trying to 
  ... I don't ... uh, you know. (resumes walking)<br/>SAM: I didn't mean to put 
  you on the spot, Buffy. There's no bad guys in this one. The only thing that 
  could ... help Riley work it out was time. Lots of time. Took him a year to 
  get over you.<br/>BUFFY: I'm glad he's over me.<br/>SAM: So, you seeing anyone 
  new? Someone special?<br/>BUFFY: You know, I just take my time, you know, I 
  don't ... I don't wanna jump right into anything, don't wanna ... you know ... 
  be defined by who I'm with.<br/>SAM: Yeah, better no guy than the wrong guy, 
  that's for sure.<br/>BUFFY: (suddenly) Sam. You know what? Um, I think we 
  should split up.<br/>SAM: (upset) Oh, I'm slowing you down. I knew I would, 
  this was just selfish of me.<br/>BUFFY: No, it's not, uh ... there's this guy, 
  uh, an informant, but he's twitchy. I show up with company, and, and we get 
  nothing.<br/>SAM: Cool. I'm guessing Finn needs me about now. (looking around) 
  He's probably off somewhere gettin' his ass kicked. (grinning) You know how 
  wild he gets. (backing away) Don't worry about Rye and me, we're good. 
  <p>Sam turns and walks off. 
  <p>BUFFY: (to herself) I noticed. 
  <p>Buffy walks off in the other direction. 
  <p>Cut to Spike's crypt. Spike sits on top of a coffin reading a book. The 
  coffin is made up as a couch, has a blanket covering it and a throw-pillow on 
  it. Sound of the door slamming open. Buffy strides in. 
  <p>SPIKE: Buffy. Hey now. (puts the book down, stands) If I'd-a known you were 
  coming, I'd-a baked a cake. 
  <p>Buffy walks over to stand in front of him, pulling off her black gloves. 
  <p>BUFFY: I need information.<br/>SPIKE: Well, suppose I could be helpful. If 
  the price is right. (Buffy putting gloves down) I'm not sure I'm selling out 
  at Double Meat Palace wages, though.<br/>BUFFY: I need to find a guy. Dealer. 
  Calls himself The Doctor.<br/>SPIKE: Human?<br/>BUFFY: His traffic 
  isn't.<br/>SPIKE: Clock ticking?<br/>BUFFY: Whatever he's doing, he's doing it 
  soon.<br/>SPIKE: (looking her up and down) Soon but not now? 
  <p>Beat. Buffy just looks at him. 
  <p>BUFFY: (quietly) Tell me you love me.<br/>SPIKE: (surprised) I love you. You 
  know I do. 
  <p>She takes a couple of steps closer. 
  <p>BUFFY: Tell me you want me.<br/>SPIKE: (whispers) I always want you. In 
  point of fact-<br/>BUFFY: Shut up. 
  <p>Buffy moves as if to kiss him, but instead she hooks her hand around his 
  neck and pulls him down onto the coffin-couch. 
  <p>Buffy lies down on her back with Spike on top of her. She begins 
  unbuttoning his shirt. Spike pulls at the fastenings on Buffy's bulletproof 
  vest. She stares at his face, pushes the partially unbuttoned shirt down on 
  his shoulders, then uses it to pull him down for a kiss. 
  <p>Fade to later. Buffy and Spike lie on the crypt sleeping with some blankets 
  covering them, not touching each other. One of Buffy's bare legs is exposed. 
  <p>Sound of the door bursting open again. Spike stirs, lifts his head to look. 
  Buffy looks too, gasps and sits up, holding a blanket over her breasts, 
  pulling it over to cover her bare leg. Spike chuckles, props himself up on his 
  elbows. 
  <p>SPIKE: Well, looky here. I don't usually use the word delicious... 
  <p>Shot of Riley standing there looking at them, large gun in hand. 
  <p>SPIKE: ...but I've gotta wager this little tableau must sting a bit, eh? Me 
  and your former? Must kill. What can I say? Girl just needs a little monster 
  in her man. 
  <p>Buffy stares at the ground looking upset. 
  <p>RILEY: That's not why I'm here ... Doctor. 
  <p>Buffy looks shocked, turns to stare at Spike, then back to stare at Riley. 
  <p>Blackout. 
  <p>
<hr align="left" width="100"/>
<b>Act IV</b><br/>
<hr align="left" width="100"/>
<p>Same scene. Buffy looks from one man to the other, still holding the 
  blanket against her body. 
  <p>BUFFY: Oh god. 
  <p>She gets up. Spike sighs. 
  <p>SPIKE: Here I thought we'd run you out of town, mate. 
  <p>Buffy crouches down, scooping up her clothing, scowling at Spike. She goes 
  off somewhere to get dressed. 
  <p>SPIKE: Last time I saw you, if memory serves, you were getting the juice 
  sucked out of you by some undead ladies of very questionable reputation. 
  <p>Spike sits up on the coffin, naked with his knees pulled up and open. Riley 
  averts his eyes. 
  <p>SPIKE: Now, be a good tin soldier and, uh... (makes a "go-away" 
  gesture)<br/>RILEY: Where are they ... Doctor?<br/>SPIKE: Where are what, and 
  why do you keep calling me that? (begins putting on pants)<br/>RILEY: Glad to 
  be back in Sunnydale. The locals all speak English, and I know who to beat for 
  information. It's all brought me here.<br/>SPIKE: Look, crew cut. (fastening 
  his belt) She's not your bint any more. And if I can speak frankly, she always 
  had a little thing for me, even when she was shagging you.<br/>RILEY: Nice. 
  That's very distracting. (walks closer) Now tell me, before I get 
  unprofessional... (pointing his gun at Spike) ...where are the eggs, 
  Spike?<br/>SPIKE: Eggs? (scoffs) You're off your nut. It must be those drugs 
  they were keeping you on. I did warn you.<br/>RILEY: Okay. We can do this the 
  hard way, or we can do this the fatal way. 
  <p>Riley punches Spike in the face, just as Buffy reappears, fully dressed. 
  <p>RILEY: Where are the eggs?<br/>BUFFY: Look, the Doctor, it can't be 
  Spike.<br/>SPIKE: No need to defend me, luv. 
  <p>Buffy punches him in the face as well. 
  <p>BUFFY: Look, i-it can't be, okay? He-he's too incompetent. (Spike glaring 
  at her) It's just Spike, Riley.<br/>RILEY: Right. Deadly ... amoral ... (Spike 
  smirking) opportunistic. (quietly) Or have you forgotten? 
  <p>Buffy glares, but has no answer to that. She turns away. 
  <p>RILEY: I'm taking this place apart until I find that nest.<br/>SPIKE: Over 
  my dead body.<br/>RILEY: I've seen enough of your dead body for one night, 
  thanks. 
  <p>Riley uses the barrel of his shotgun to shove Spike aside. As he passes, 
  Spike grabs his shoulder. 
  <p>SPIKE: Well, you're not gonna- 
  <p>Riley shoves him back. Spike stumbles back against a pillar. Riley starts 
  down the ladder to the underground part of the crypt. 
  <p>RILEY: (OS) You coming? 
  <p>Buffy looks up, looks at Spike. He stares back at her. She follows Riley. 
  <p>SPIKE: (angry) Oh, this is ... unconstitutional, is what it is! (grabbing a 
  shirt, putting it on) Here! 
  <p>Cut to below. Riley and Buffy reach the ground. 
  <p>SPIKE: (OS) There's nothin' to see down there! 
  <p>Buffy hurries after Riley as he moves through the underground rooms. 
  <p>BUFFY: Riley, look, I'm not saying that he's good, okay, I'm just saying 
  that he's not capable of something as- 
  <p>She stops as they round a corner and come upon the demon eggs. 
  <p>The eggs are about the size of beach-balls but brownish-grey and scaly. 
  There are at least ten, possibly more. 
  <p>Riley cocks his gun. 
  <p>Closer shot of the eggs, surrounded by yellowish goo the same color as the 
  demon's blood. 
  <p>Spike runs in, wearing the shirt (unbuttoned). 
  <p>SPIKE: I can explain.<br/>RILEY: We're gonna need more weapons. Spike 
  screwed up. You didn't keep 'em frozen, did you ... Doctor?<br/>SPIKE: You can 
  stop calling me that any time. If I may, the thing of it is, I'm holding these 
  for a friend, who- 
  <p>Buffy punches him in the nose again. He falls down on his butt, his nose 
  bloody. 
  <p>BUFFY: No more games. 
  <p>Spike gets to his feet, angry. 
  <p>SPIKE: Well, that's bloody funny coming from you! No more games? (Buffy 
  rolling her eyes) That's all you've ever done is play me. You keep playing 
  with rules you make up as you like. You know what I am. You've always known. 
  You come to me all the same.<br/>RILEY: Can you shut him up?<br/>BUFFY: Not so 
  far. 
  <p>Spike exits. 
  <p>RILEY: You better get outta here. 
  <p>Buffy backs away. Riley stands staring at the eggs. 
  <p>Suddenly one of the eggs bursts open and a baby demon pops out, screeching. 
  It looks a bit like a crab or a very large cockroach. 
  <p>RILEY: On second thought, stick around. 
  <p>Riley tosses his gun to Buffy and pulls out the taser. More baby demons pop 
  out of the eggs and move toward them, fast. Riley and Buffy back away. 
  <p>BUFFY: Riley, I-<br/>RILEY: Aim high, plenty of lead.<br/>BUFFY: I'm not 
  exactly gun girl.<br/>RILEY: You wanna live, learn fast. 
  <p>Buffy fires the gun randomly. It hits a stack of LP records, shattering 
  them. Another shot hits a pillow on the bed; feathers fly. A third shot 
  destroys a lamp. 
  <p>BUFFY: These things? (uses the gun to club a demon as it flies at her) 
  Never useful. 
  <p>She tosses the gun away. She and Riley look around. 
  <p>Several of the babies are scurrying across the ceiling. 
  <p>RILEY: We have to pull out. 
  <p>One demon falls onto Riley's shoulder. He grabs at it, pries it off. He and 
  Buffy begin to run for the exit. The baby demons pursue. 
  <p>Buffy looks around. The baby demons are crawling across every bit of 
  ceiling and wall. She runs for the ladder. 
  <p>Cut to above. Buffy emerges as Riley is lying on the floor just next to the 
  opening to below. 
  <p>RILEY: We need a way to contain these things-<br/>BUFFY: Riley! 
  <p>Buffy grabs Riley's belt, detaches it. There are several grenades on it. 
  She pulls the pin on one, and drops the entire belt down into the hole. 
  <p>RILEY: Get down! 
  <p>Buffy lies down on top of Riley, shielding him. 
  <p>Shot of the belt lying by the base of the ladder as the baby demons move 
  around and past it. 
  <p>Wide shot of the underground part of the crypt as the grenades go off. Fire 
  bursts across the cavern and engulfs the eggs. 
  <p>Wide shot of the above as a fireball shoots up from the opening, while 
  Buffy and Riley lie on the floor cringing. 
  <p>The fire subsides and Buffy lifts her head. She and Riley are both panting. 
  She lies fully on top of him.<br/>ANYA VOICEOVER: You know, if you love Riley 
  Finn so much, maybe you should just marry him. 
  <p>Cut to close shot of Xander. 
  <p>XANDER: He's taken. And that's not the point. 
  <p>Cut to wider shot. We see Xander sitting on the edge of the bathtub and 
  Anya sitting beside him on the closed toilet. Faint sounds of angry voices in 
  background. 
  <p>ANYA: So you think that their marriage is better than ours, is that 
  it?<br/>XANDER: No! But granted, I have a hard time imagining Nick and Nora 
  Fury hiding out from their own relatives in the bathroom. 
  <p>Sound of crashing and banging from outside. They both look toward the door 
  in alarm. 
  <p>XANDER: (sighs) And I have no idea what Riley and Mrs. Riley's wedding was 
  like.<br/>ANYA: Well, you haven't shut up about them.<br/>XANDER: Well, they 
  have a great marriage! And it bummed Buffy out, but I can see it. And Anya ... 
  I really have no clue what their wedding was like.<br/>ANYA: So our wedding... 
  (Xander nodding) ...is not our marriage. (smiles)<br/>XANDER: Separate things. 
  One fills me with a dread akin to public speaking engagements. <br/>ANYA: And 
  that would be the wedding.<br/>XANDER: Which will be over soon.<br/>ANYA: But 
  our marriage...<br/>XANDER: That lasts forever. 
  <p>Anya smiles, looking relieved. 
  <p>ANYA: Ah, well. That works out nicely, then. 
  <p>She leans over to kiss Xander. Another loud crash from the apartment. They 
  both listen, looking unperturbed. 
  <p>Cut to: exterior of the magic shop, night. Buffy and Riley emerge onto the 
  street, walk along the sidewalk. 
  <p>BUFFY: So, are you and Sam headed back to Central America? Or, is that 
  classified?<br/>RILEY: Nepal.<br/>BUFFY: Sounds fun.<br/>RILEY: I'll send you a 
  postcard. 
  <p>They both stop walking and speak at the same time. 
  <p>RILEY: Buffy-<br/>BUFFY: Riley-<br/>RILEY: By mission parameters I'm done 
  here. But I have authorization to take the Doctor out. (pause) Do you want me 
  to do that?<br/>BUFFY: (shocked) Do I want you to... (looks away) How can you 
  ask me ... I'm sleeping with hi-him. (carefully) I'm sleeping with 
  Spike.<br/>RILEY: I had actually noticed that.<br/>BUFFY: And then you come back 
  ... and did you wait until your life was absolutely perfect and then send that 
  demon here so you could throw it in my face?<br/>RILEY: Look ... you think this 
  was easy for me?<br/>BUFFY: Yeah! I think it was a rollicking adventure, fun 
  for the whole family.<br/>RILEY: I was terrified about seeing you 
  again.<br/>BUFFY: Well, I'm sure my incredible patheticness softened the blow 
  for you. 
  <p>Riley looks annoyed, fidgets a bit. 
  <p>RILEY: I don't know what you're talking about.<br/>BUFFY: Riley, please 
  don't patronize-<br/>RILEY: Hey! You want me to say that I liked seeing you in 
  bed with that idiot? Or that blinding orange is your very best color? Or that 
  that ... burger smell is appealing?<br/>BUFFY: (upset) You smelled the 
  smell?<br/>RILEY: Buffy, none of that means anything. It doesn't touch you. 
  You're still the first woman I ever loved ... and the strongest woman I've 
  ever known. And I'm not advertising this to the missus ... but you're still 
  quite the hottie.<br/>BUFFY: You know, it goes away after many 
  bathings.<br/>RILEY: (laughs) This isn't about who's on top. I know how lucky I 
  am right now. I love my work, and I love my wife.<br/>BUFFY: I know. And I 
  kinda love her too.<br/>RILEY: So you're not in the greatest place right now. 
  And maybe I made it worse. <br/>BUFFY: No.<br/>RILEY: Wheel never stops turning, 
  Buffy. You're up, you're down ... it doesn't change what you are. And you are 
  a hell of a woman.<br/>BUFFY: (deep breath) Riley, that night... (Riley just 
  looking at her) I never got the chance ... to tell you ... how sorry I was. 
  About what happened between us.<br/>RILEY: And you never have to. 
  <p>The door to the magic shop opens again and Sam and Xander emerge, followed 
  by Dawn and Willow. 
  <p>SAM: Well, the wedding itself was held in a military chopper just before a 
  hairy night drop into hostile territory.<br/>XANDER: Huh! And just curious, 
  what's a chopper rental run these days? 
  <p>Riley and Buffy exchange an amused look. 
  <p>SAM: Oh, well, actually, we commandeered it from a local guerilla squad, so 
  ... cheap!<br/>XANDER: Oh!<br/>SAM: Yeah. 
  <p>The others join Riley and Buffy where they're standing. 
  <p>SAM: (to Willow) You have my email, you promise you'll keep in 
  touch?<br/>WILLOW: You won't get traced? I don't wanna lead the bad guys to 
  your location by mistake. 
  <p>Sam and Riley smile at each other. 
  <p>SAM: Our line's secure.<br/>WILLOW: (smiling) Oh, huh, duh, of course it is! 
  I keep thinking of you like regular people, but no, you're not.<br/>SAM: Oh, 
  right, like demon-hunting is all exotic to a girl from Sunnydale. 
  <p>Dawn confronts Riley as we see Sam hugging Willow and Xander in background. 

  <p>DAWN: So you gonna say goodbye this time, or just ... split all 
  secret-agenty like last time? (sound of a helicopter)<br/>RILEY: Depends. I 
  warrant a hug? 
  <p>Dawn doesn't smile, but she steps forward and hugs Riley. Then he pulls 
  back to look at her face. 
  <p>RILEY: Goodbye, Dawn.<br/>DAWN: I thought it would suck less this time. It 
  doesn't. 
  <p>Riley smiles fondly at her. 
  <p>SAM: It was really nice meeting you all. (taps Riley on the shoulder, moves 
  away) You ready for Nepal, agent?<br/>RILEY: (to Xander) Soldier. 
  <p>Riley follows Sam onto the street. The helicopter noise is louder and we 
  see its lights shining on the group. 
  <p>Riley and Sam move a bit away from the others. 
  <p>RILEY: (to Sam) Fire-fights, bug hunts, big body counts ... yeah, I could 
  use a break. 
  <p>A thin wire drops down from the copter. Riley attaches it to his belt. He 
  and Sam put their arms around each other, and Riley tugs on the line to signal 
  the copter. 
  <p>Long shot of the two of them rising into the air as the others stand 
  watching. Buffy stands a little ways off from the others. Willow waves. 
  <p>WILLOW: Bye!<br/>XANDER: Bye! Bye Riley! Bye Sam! 
  <p>The helicopter moves away with Riley and Sam still dangling from it. 
  <p>Angle on the others watching. Dawn and Xander turn and walk off left, out 
  of shot. Willow moves right, over to Buffy, still waving. 
  <p>WILLOW: What a bitch. 
  <p>Willow turns and follows Xander and Dawn away. Buffy watches her go, then 
  looks back up at the departing helicopter, pensive. 
  <p>Fade to Spike's crypt. Spike stands there looking at the mess. His 
  furniture and possessions, bits of demon, all scattered around everywhere, 
  burnt and charred. He nudges a bit of rubble with his foot, sighs, stares at 
  the floor. 
  <p>Buffy appears, stops a little ways off. Spike doesn't look at her. 
  <p>SPIKE: So she's back. Thought you'd be off snogging with 
  soldier-boy.<br/>BUFFY: He's gone.<br/>SPIKE: (looks at her) So, you come for a 
  bit of cold comfort? (sighs, gestures) The bed's a bit blown up, but then, 
  that was never our-<br/>BUFFY: I'm not here to- 
  <p>She breaks off. Spike just looks at her. 
  <p>BUFFY: And I'm not here to bust your chops about your stupid scheme, 
  either. That's just you. I should have remembered.<br/>SPIKE: So this is worse 
  then, is it, this is you telling me-<br/>BUFFY: It's over.<br/>SPIKE: (smiles, 
  moves closer to her) I've memorized this tune, luv. Think I have the sheet 
  music. Doesn't change what you want.<br/>BUFFY: I know that. (pauses) I do want 
  you. (Spike looking surprised) Being with you ... makes things ... simpler. 
  For a little while.<br/>SPIKE: I don't call five hours straight a little 
  while.<br/>BUFFY: I'm using you. 
  <p>He stares at her. 
  <p>BUFFY: I can't love you. I'm just ... being weak, and selfish...<br/>SPIKE: 
  (moves even closer) Really not complaining here.<br/>BUFFY: ...and it's killing 
  me. 
  <p>Spike frowns. 
  <p>BUFFY: I have to be strong about this. 
  <p>He continues staring at her. 
  <p>BUFFY: I'm sorry ... William. 
  <p>She turns and walks off, leaving Spike looking stricken. 
  <p>Cut to above. Buffy walks out of the crypt into 
  sunlight.<br/><br/>Blackout.<br/>Executive Producers: Joss Whedon and Marti Noxon.
