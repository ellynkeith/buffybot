<h3>Prologue:</h3>
<p><b>4     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - NIGHT<br/>
    Xander's showing his apartment to his new roommate, seeming somewhat peeved.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  You're gonna live in that small room over there. I know it looks like a closet, 
  but it's a room now. (Buffy and Dawn follow Xander into the apartment) You're 
  not gonna touch my food. I take the first shower in the morning, and if I use 
  up all the hot water, (show Spike standing at the doorway) that's your tough 
  noogies. (to Buffy) And I hate this plan. (to Spike) Are you keeping up, or 
  do you need some kind of English-to-ConstantPainInMyAss translation?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (leans forward to remind Xander) Invitation.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (to Buffy) Is there something more emphatic than hate? Can I revile the plan? 
  Fine. (to Spike) I invite you in. (Spike enters) Nimrod. (stands in front of 
  his closet)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Don't want your soddin' food anyway.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (to Buffy) I just don't understand when his problems became your problems—more 
  specifically mine. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  The school basement is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Why not? Crazy-Basement-Guy is better than Stalking-Buffy-Guy. </p>
<p><i>Spike looks down, ashamed. </i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  It's true. You guys aren't... You're not starting up again with the whole—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No. A thousand gallons of no. OK, it's just—things are different now—he has 
  a soul.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I'm sure that'll be a real comfort when he soulfully attacks you again.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Yeah, what does that mean exactly—that Spike is all soul-having?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I don't know, but he's been through a lot, OK, and nobody's attacking—</p>
<p><i>Spike walks forward and touches Buffy's arm. She's startled.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Buffy— Sorry.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No, it's me. I-I just—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I'll go. This can't work.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It will. I-it already is. OK, you know, you've been out of the basement for 
  half an hour, and you've already stopped talking to invisible people.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Bollocks.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  OK, so there was that one episode in the car, but—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  No, bollocks to the whole thing. I don't need your mollycoddling.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It's not coddling. Now go to your closet.</p>
<p><i>She leaves and Dawn follows. Spike sighs.</i></p>
<p><b>5     EXT.     FOOTBALL 
    FIELD AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Football players are practicing while Buffy and Dawn talk on the bleachers. 
    It's a pretty, sunny day. </b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  So, what is it?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  What's what?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Last night, you said you weren't helping Spike out of pity. What is it?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It's a good question. (sips her drink through a straw)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Is sitting there drinking soda some kind of a Zen non-answer?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (puts sunglasses on top of her head) No, I just... I don't know what I'm feeling. 
  I think I can't stand him, but sometimes...</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  You love him?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No. I—I feel for him.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Feel what, exactly?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (shakes her head) Dawn...</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  No, I'm—I'm just trying to understand. I mean, none of it makes sense. First 
  you say Spike disgusts you, but secretly you two are doing it like bunnies. 
  And then Spike says he'd die for you, but he tries to rape you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (sighs) For the record, Spike knew how wrong it was. That's why he went away. 
</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  But to get a soul? Like that would make him a better man? Xander had a soul 
  when he stood Anya up at the altar. And now he says he still wants her? I just 
  don't think it's the school basement that's making people crazy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (sighs) I should really get back. You comin' with? (gathers her things)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  I just don't see why people bother. I mean, you put all this energy into chasing 
  and having and brooding and— I just don't understand these relationships where 
  you all do insane things.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Bye, rant girl. (walks away)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Well, you could, like, paint a beautiful mural on every ugly wall in the world, 
  and then you could paint a beautiful mural on every ugly mural in the wor—</p>
<p><i>Dawn spots the quarterback, a tall, slender, athletic blonde teenager, putting 
    on his letterman jacket after practice. The theme song from "A Summer 
    Place" plays in the background. She's mesmerized as he drinks from a 
    squirt bottle and then douses his face with water from the bottle and walks 
    off. She's watching him so intently, that she leans after him as he leaves, 
    causing her to lose balance and fall off the bleachers.</i></p>

<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>6     INT.     ANYA'S 
    APARTMENT - DAY<br/>
    Buffy's using her battleaxe to fight a demon in Anya's apartment. The place 
    is completely trashed. Anya's on the floor in the corner, crawling.</b></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Maybe I'm not even the right Anyanka. Ever think about that? There's tons of 
  Anyanka's out there. Maybe one of them pissed off this, uh— what did you say 
  his name was? D'Hoffryneffer...</p>
<p><i>Buffy and the demon continue to fight until Buffy finally hurls the battleaxe 
    at him, and it lands in his chest, killing him.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Good thing I stopped by and heard screaming. (helps Anya up) So, I guess D'Hoffryn 
  decided to take you out after all?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Yeah. He's, uh, not head of vengeance for nothing. (gets ice tray from the freezer) 
  Well, thank you for the generous life-saving. Now please go away. (takes ice 
  and dishtowel into the other room, picks up a knocked-over chair) Look, I don't 
  need anyone's help. Or, OK, clearly I do, (sits in chair) but I don't want to 
  need anyone's help, so stop helping. (starts making an ice pack with the ice 
  and towel)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I get it. After last week, you feel you need to be all renegade and broody. 
  Taking yourself out of the loop—</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I need to figure out who I am. (puts ice pack on her leg)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Another, something bad is happening. I don't want my friends out there alone 
  right now, OK?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Well, I-I guess you guys could use my help. Willow's not very good with the 
  practical strategizing—except when she's evil. And Dawn—she's not really good 
  for anything. </p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>7     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Dawn is pacing back and forth in front of the stairway, psyching herself up 
    for something. Around the corner, the quarterback she saw earlier is talking 
    with some friends: another male football player and two female cheerleaders, 
    one of whom is on crutches. They are all standing in a circle in front of 
    the lockers.</b></p>
<p><b>CHEERLEADER ON CRUTCHES</b><br/>
  You guys, I've been thinking about it, and I think I can still cheer. I mean, 
  I could use a chair or we all could, like the Laker Girls.</p>
<p><b>CHEERLEADER FRIEND</b><br/>
  Oh, honey, you need to concentrate on getting better. Don't worry. We'll find 
  a replacement for you tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>CHEERLEADER ON CRUTCHES</b><br/>
  I just feel like I let you down. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (walks up to their circle) Hey, R.J.</p>
<p><b>CHEERLEADER FRIEND</b><br/>
  Oh, Dawn.</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Hey, Summers.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (they don't let her in the circle) Um, so I-I-I was wondering. You had Mr. Gurin 
  for English back at your old school, right?</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  We all did.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  I have him this year.(uneasy silence) What a drag.</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  I actually kinda liked him.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Right! Right. No, no, I like him. It's just, you know, I meant drag in a good, 
  fun way. </p>
<p><b>JOCK FRIEND</b><br/>
  (ignoring Dawn) So, um, are the tryouts tomorrow? You're gonna make the new 
  girls jump up and down a lot, right?</p>
<p><b>CHEERLEADER FRIEND</b><br/>
  God, gross! A vending machine fell on Cheryl and all you can think about is 
  new cheerleaders?</p>
<p><i>Despite the fact that these people are actively ignoring her, Dawn persists. 
    </i> </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Hey, um, so, you know, I heard someone saying yesterday that we're gonna go 
  all the way to the championships this year. In football. </p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Yeah, we actually have a good shot, considering we're a new team.</p>
<p><b>JOCK FRIEND</b><br/>
  Yeah, well if you can get us past Highland, we've got a good shot.</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Oh, like you could do better.</p>
<p><b>JOCK FRIEND</b><br/>
  We'll see.</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Wait, you actually think Coach'd start you at quarterback over me?</p>
<p><b>JOCK FRIEND</b><br/>
  I'm just saying...</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (impassioned) The quarterback is like the most important member of the team. 
  He is like the rudder that guides the ship.</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Right. Could I give you a hand with that? (gesturing to the book bag of the 
  girl on crutches)</p>
<p><b>CHEERLEADER ON CRUTCHES</b><br/>
  Would you really? (hands her bag to R.J.)</p>
<p><b>CHEERLEADER FRIEND</b><br/>
  (catty) It's OK, she can do it herself. </p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Hey, we're all on the same team, all right?</p>
<p><i>They all walk off without acknowledging Dawn.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (under her breath) Yeah, you're all on the team. (calls after them) We'll talk 
  later, guys. That's cool. </p>

<p><b>8     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Dawn's going through boxes that are stored in the basement. Finally, she finds 
    what she's looking for after going through a half-dozen boxes.</b></p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>9     INT.     GYMNASIUM 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    They're holding cheerleading tryouts in the gym. There are a dozen or so girls 
    trying out, all dressed in workout clothes, except Dawn, who's dressed in 
    Buffy's old cheerleading uniform. </b></p>
<p><b>CHEERLEADER WANNABE #1</b><br/>
  (cheers) Gooooo Razorbacks! (does a somersault)</p>
<p><i>R.J.'s friend, the same girl from the circle, is heading the cheerleader 
    tryouts.</i></p>
<p><b>CHEERLEADER FRIEND</b><br/>
  OK. Awesome. Thank you. Up next, we have—Dawn Summers. (Dawn walks to the open 
  area) Nice outfit.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (cheering badly) Razorbacks, razorbacks, we're gonna play, we got a secret weapon 
  and his name is R.J. Hear us cheer, hear us yell, listen what we say, razorbacks, 
  razorbacks, go R.J.!</p>
<p><i>Dawn's cheering was abysmal. She tries to do a cartwheel at the end, but 
    falls down on her butt. R.J. was there to watch the auditions, and seemed 
    kind of embarrassed.</i></p>
<p><b>CHEERLEADER FRIEND</b><br/>
  OK. Thank you. Very... spirited. </p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>10     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy's standing at a door. Dawn's obviously locked herself in the bathroom 
    to hide from today's events. Dawn's sobbing audibly behind the door. </b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Come on, Dawnie. Come out. Dawn, sweetheart, it's not that bad.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (opens door) How would you even know? R.J.'s never gonna notice me now. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  From what you said, I'm sure he already noticed you, I mean with the falling 
  and the—(Dawn squeaks, closes door) spirit. Spirit. They said you were spirited, 
  right? </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Go away!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Dawn... </p>
<p><i>Xander walks upstairs to find Buffy. </i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Things are a lot better, I see.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I don't think tonight's gonna be good for videos, Xand.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Right, with the wailing and the crying... Still better than a cozy evening with 
  Spike. Shall I order a pizza? Don't teens in a snit like pizza?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (opens door angrily) It is not a snit! I-I finally met him—they guy of my dreams, 
  OK—and I blew it. R.J. hates me now.</p>
<p><i>On the bathroom floor, Buffy sees her cheerleading outfit, shredded.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Dawn, what is that?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Just the end of my life. (storms off to her room to cry more)</p>
<p><i>Buffy collects her outfit.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Remember when she used to have a crush on me? I miss the much cuter "me" 
  crush.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>11     INT.     DAWN'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Dawn is lying across her bed, listening to music. Buffy comes into her room, 
    carrying her shredded cheerleading outfit. Xander follows.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You shredded my outfit.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  I'll buy you a new one.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  That's not the point. I don't want a new cheerleading outfit. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Now, now, let's not be hasty. (Buffy glares at him) Not the right time. </p>
<p><i>Buffy hands shredded outfit to Xander and sits on bed beside Dawn.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Dawn, I'm sorry that you feel so bad. OK, but in the morning this won't seem 
  so terrible. You don't even know this R.J. Not really.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (sits up in the bed) I do know him. I know his soul.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Really? Dawn, he wasn't even on your radar yesterday. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  It's the jacket. It's true. Something about the big letter on the chest makes 
  girls get all swoony and crushy. I saw it all the time in school. And you couldn't 
  just pin any old felt letter to your coat and get play— (catches himself) not 
  that I tried. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  It isn't a crush. It's love. I love R.J.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Again, since yesterday. Dawn, it's awfully fast. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (incensed) What? You're telling me I don't feel what I feel?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No, of course not. I believe that you think it's real. It seems real... to you.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  You know what? Maybe I don't want advice from the Dysfunction Queen. You have 
  no idea how I feel. You have no idea what real love is. Maybe if you did, you 
  wouldn't make fun of me this way. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Dawn, I'm not making fun of you.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Just go. Leave me alone. (flops back down on the bed)</p>

    The bell rings between classes. Dawn happens to be in the hallway near R.J.'s 
    locker when R.J.'s jock friend is talking to him.</b></p>
<p><b>JOCK FRIEND</b><br/>
  I talked with the coach.</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Yeah? I told you man—all those fumbles in practice—he was gonna come down 
  on you.</p>
<p><b>JOCK FRIEND</b><br/>
  I'm starting on Saturday.</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Great. Who knew fumbling all the time was the key?</p>
<p><b>JOCK FRIEND</b><br/>
  It's just time to let someone else have a turn, man. And you knew this was coming.</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Yeah. Sure. (turns to his locker)</p>
<p><i>The Jock walks down the hall toward the stairs, and Dawn follows him. </i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  You can't do this to R.J.</p>
<p><b>JOCK FRIEND</b><br/>
  Oh, hey, it's you. Nice cheering the other day. (laughs)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  It isn't fair. He works so hard.</p>
<p><b>JOCK FRIEND</b><br/>
  What do you care? I mean, this is how the game is played. It's dog eat dog, 
  may the best man win.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  But nobody's better than R.J.</p>
<p><b>JOCK FRIEND</b><br/>
  (laughs) Yeah, well, that's not really up to you, is it? Hmm?</p>

    OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Dawn is sitting in the chair in front of Principal Wood, who's at his desk. 
    Buffy's leaning against a table near him. They are both staring at Dawn.</b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  It all happened so fast. I mean, one minute he was walking, and the next he 
  stumbled, and then he fell.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Why would he say you pushed him down the stairs?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  I don't know. Maybe he was just embarrassed. It's hard being clumsy, especially 
  when you're popular and athletic. I'd bet. </p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Yeah, well, to be candid, it wouldn't be the first time I caught O'Donnell in 
  a lie. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It'd be nice if his lies didn't involve my sister, though.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Anyway, I'm gonna have to call Coach Wheeler and, uh, tell him the bad news.

  Couple years ahead of us. He used to stick chewing gum in my hair. (Willow looks 
  horrified) Huh.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  What're you thinking?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Well, I think my relationship with R.J.'s brother was complex at best, but...maybe 
  he's a way in.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (to Willow) Now, look for a picture.</p>

    STREET - NIGHT<br/>
    Standing in front of someone's house, Xander's talking to Spike, who seems 
    a bit uncomfortable.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I'm just saying, we're—we're tangling with a powerful spell here. (they walk 
  up to the house) We don't know what the deal is so—so keep an eye out if this 
  guy looks twitchy. And don't let this guy charm you, either. He had everyone 
  around him practically kissing his ring back in high school.</p>
<p><i>They're standing on the front porch now, ringing the doorbell. An angel 
    decorates the door jamb, and Spike avoids its glare. A tall, ungroomed, unathletic 
    guy answers the door in a pizza delivery uniform. Xander and Spike both stare 
    at him in disbelief.</i></p>
<p><b>BROTHER</b><br/>
  Yeah?</p>

<p><b>30     INT.     BROOK'S 
    HOME - NIGHT<br/>
    The brother is sitting slouched in an overstuffed chair. Xander and Spike 
    are sitting across from him on the couch. The room's lovingly decorated with 
    pale ivory colors, soft lighting and lace, and there are knick-knacks everywhere. 
    Each guy is drinking a bottle of beer.</b></p>
<p><b>BROTHER</b><br/>
  Construction, huh? That's awesome. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>BROTHER</b><br/>
  So, what's up with R.J.? How's he doing at the old alpha mater?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Good. It's just— (Spike stands and starts walking around the room) I know a 
  girl that might be going out with him and I was wondering—</p>
<p><b>BROTHER</b><br/>
  God, and you want to know if he's a good guy. Truth is, he's the best. Following 
  in my footsteps. You might not know it now, looking at me with a couple of extra 
  pounds, but back then, I was quite the guy. </p>
<p><i>Spike's standing at the back of the room now, near a curio cabinet full 
    of statuettes.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Yeah, I gather that R.J. is pretty popular, too.</p>
<p><b>BROTHER</b><br/>
  I gotta tell ya. There was a time I was worried about R.J. He was into comic 
  books, Model U.N., geek stuff—no offense, Harris. </p>
<p><i>While the brother's talking, Spike's inspecting the figurines on the curio 
    cabinet. They're all angels. Dozens and dozens of angels. He starts turning 
    them around, where they're not facing him anymore.</i></p>
<p><b>BROTHER</b><br/>
    One time, I found all this poetry under his bed. Turns out, he wrote it. Then 
    he, uh—what do you call it? Blossomed. That's what it was like. </p>
<p><i>Spike's still walking around the room, looking at things. </i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  And do you have any idea why he, you know, burst into a flower all of a sudd—?</p>
<p><i>Standing in front of the mantle, Spike's looking at the pictures that adorn 
    it.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  You're wearing your brother's jacket. Here, in this picture. </p>
<p><b>BROTHER</b><br/>
  Oh, no, dude. He's wearing mine. That jacket was with me all the way through 
  high school. Gave it to him when I graduated, right before I started over at 
  the Pizza Barn. I'm in the management program. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  So, Lance, where did you get the jacket?</p>
<p><b>LANCE/BROTHER</b><br/>
  Oh, dad gave it to me. Made a big deal about it, too. How he met mom wearing 
  that jacket. She was a former Miss Arkansas. Very hot in her day. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (stands) Wow, that's wonderful. Boy, it's getting late.</p>
<p><b>LANCE</b><br/>
  Hey, you guys don't have to take off if you don't want too. I got sort of a 
  rumpus room set up in the basement. There's air hockey and a mini fridge. We 
  could party.</p>
<p><b>MRS. BROOKS (O.S.)</b><br/>
  Lance? Do you have guests down there? There's little boxes or raisins if you 
  want snacks. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  We really gotta go. </p>

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (sighs) Damn love spell. I have tried every anti-love spell spell I could find. 
</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Even if you find the right one, the guy would probably just do an anti-anti-love 
  spell spell... spell. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  What? (doorbell rings, she stands) I'll get it. (goes to door) Maybe it's Xander 
  with some answers from the brother. </p>
<p><i>Willow opens the door, and it's R.J. standing there, wearing his jacket. 
    </i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Oh, you have to be—</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  I was looking for Buffy. Miss Summers.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Buffy's not here. Go away!</p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Are you sure?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (walks up to the door, stands beside Willow) No Buffy for you. Leave quickly 
  now. </p>
<p><b>R.J.</b><br/>
  Uh-huh. OK. Tell her to call me.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Man... </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Good thing Buffy and Dawn are upstairs. If they knew he was here...</p>
<p><i>As R.J. walks away, the theme song to "A Summer Place" starts 
    to play in the background. Anya and Willow stare at him intently, watching 
    him walk away. Clearly, they're getting excited by this sight.</i></p>

  But you don't even know him!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Yes, I do. I looked into him and saw his soul.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  He was walking away, so unless his soul was in his ass—</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  A.J. is my best friend and my dearest darling—</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  It's R.J. And what you were picking up on was his deep caring and devotion to 
  me.</p>
<p><i>Buffy and Dawn walk downstairs and see Willow and Anya arguing.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  What's going on?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Willow thinks she's in love with my boyfriend, R.J. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  What? No! You two can't do this.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Willow, you're a gay woman—and he isn't.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  This isn't about his physical presence. It's about his heart. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  His physical presence has a penis!</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I can work around it!</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  This isn't fair! How can you all be doing this to me?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  OK, wait. Everyone wait. Just calm down, OK? I-I think I know what this is. 
  Clearly, you've both been affected by the same love spell that got Dawn. (Willow 
  and Anya roll their eyes)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Uh! This isn't a spell. He owns my heart.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Dawn, be quiet. We're trying to work this out. We don't need you interfering.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  There's a simple answer to this. Just think about who loves him the most. Clearly 
  I do, since I'm willing to look past the whole orientation thing. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  I need him.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Well, you're gonna have to do better than that—I'd kill for him.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (scoffs) You'd kill for a chocolate bar.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No. Yes! Kill for him. I'm the slayer. Slayer means kill. Oh, I'll kill the 
  principal. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Ooh, that is hard to top.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Yeah, well I have skills. I can prove my love with magic.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Yeah, right. What're you gonna do—use magic to make him into a girl? (Willow's

    train beside her and climbs up to the top of the train car. Dawn can tell 
    the train is close to running her over, so she turns her head away, clinches 
    her eyes shut and waits. Buffy jumps off the train, landing near Dawn. She

    train rolls down the tracks where she was only moments before. Buffy and Dawn 
    stand.</i></p>

  This is the plan? You're gonna steal R.J. by being trisected?!</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  What am I—gonna compete with you? You're older and hotter and have sex that's 
  rough and kill people. I don't have any of that stuff. But if I did this then 
  his whole life he'd know there was someone that loved him so much they'd give 
  up their life. </p>
