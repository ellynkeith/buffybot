<h3>TEASER (RECAP SEGMENT):</h3>
<p><b>GILES (V.O.)</b><br/>
  Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer</p>
<p><b>1     EXT.     WOODS 
    SOMEWHERE IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT<br/>
    Warren is strung up between a pair of trees. He is tied at four points, splayed 
    out like the famous DaVinci diagram. Willow, in full dark magic splendor (black 
    hair, black eyes), motions her hand toward Warren, and with a twist of her 
    wrist, removes his skin. Warren screams in agony.</b></p>
<p><b>2     EXT.     ENGLISH 
    COUNTRYSIDE - DAY<br/>
    Giles is riding a horse through a field. Then he and Willow are talking in 
    front of the manor.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW<br/>
</b>I killed people, Giles.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  I've not forgotten.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  When you brought me here, I thought it was to kill me. Instead, you go all Dumbledore 
  on me. </p>
<p><b>3     INT.     MANOR IN 
    ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY<br/>
    Willow is sitting on a suitcase in an exterior doorway, talking to Giles who 
    is leaning on the doorjamb. The countryside is in the background outside the 
    manor.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW<br/>
</b>I don't want to go back home just so I can screw up again. </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  What exactly are you afraid of?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  What if I go all veiny and homicidal again? And what if—</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  —they won't take you back?</p>
<p><b>4     INT.     BRONZE 
    NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy, Xander, Spike and Nancy have come to the club to question Anya about 
    the worm monster that's been terrorizing Nancy.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER<br/>
</b>(to Anya) Did you turn this nice lady's ex into a giant worm-monster?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (to Nancy) You wish it, I dish it. I thought we were clear on this. </p>
<p><b>5     INT.     CHAPEL 
    AT CEMETERY - NIGHT<br/>
    Lit dimly by moonlight, Buffy and Spike are talking. There is a large, simple, 
    gothic crucifix at the front of the chapel that can be seen by looking directly 
    down the central aisle. </b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE<br/>
</b>It's what you wanted, right? </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Tell me what happened.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Why does a man do what he mustn't? For her. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Your soul. You got your soul back.</p>

<h3><b>PROLOGUE:</b></h3>
<p><b>6     INT.     SUNNYDALE 
    AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT<br/>
    Clock shows 9:24. Arriving passengers are exiting the gate into the waiting 
    area. Families and friends are reunited with their loved ones. A man exits 
    to be greeted by his wife and two daughters.</b></p>
<p><b>HUSBAND<br/>
</b>Hi. How are you doing? </p>
<p><b>WIFE</b><br/>
  Hi, honey. Good.</p>
<p><b>HUSBAND</b><br/>
  And how's it going with you two?</p>
<p><b>DAUGHTERS</b><br/>
  Hi, Dad.</p>
<p><i>Another family exits the plane together: a father, a daughter, and a son. 
    The daughter pushes the son, who drops his backpack, and the daughter trips 
    over it.</i></p>
<p><b>DAUGHTER</b><br/>
  Go on. (pushes him) See what you did?</p>
<p><b>FATHER</b><br/>
  Hey, stop acting up!</p>
<p><i>Buffy, Xander and Dawn are waiting at the gate for Willow to deplane. Xander 
    is holding a white sign with "WELCOME BACK WILLOW" written on it 
    in yellow crayon.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  You think she'll get the sign?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Get the sign? I don't think she's gonna see the sign.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Why is it so pale?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I used yellow crayon. It was a thing from when I talked to Willow on the bluff. 
  I hope she gets it.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Oh, tell us again what you said.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Well, I was talking from my heart and I knew Evil Willow wasn't really ready 
  to— You were kidding.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Mm-hmm. A little bit.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  We've heard the crayon speech a few times. Not that it's not great, of course.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I saved the world with talking from my mouth. My mouth saved the world.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Uh-huh. I'm getting nervous. Are you nervous?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Yeah. It's gonna be weird seeing her. What do you say to someone in this situation?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I'm gonna say "Hi, Willow."</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  C'mon. You're saying it's not going to be the least bit strange? We saw her 
  kill someone. She was about to kill Dawn—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  And Giles wouldn't let her leave unless she completed that whatever recovery 
  course.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Right. (Buffy smiles guiltily. Dawn looks at Buffy) Right?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  She kinda didn't finish.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  She didn't finish? She didn't finish being not evil?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    H-he said it was really important that she come back early and that she was 
    doing really well and we shouldn't worry.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Guys, I just noticed something. Everyone's off the plane, so where's Willow?</p>

    Clock shows 9:24. Arriving passengers are exiting the gate into the waiting 
    area. Looks like the same passengers that exited last scene. A man exits to 
    be greeted by his wife and two daughters.</b></p>
<p><b>HUSBAND<br/>
</b>Hi. How are you doing? </p>
<p><b>WIFE</b><br/>
  Hi, honey. Good.</p>
<p><b>HUSBAND</b><br/>
  And how's it going with you two?</p>

  Go on. (pushes him) See what you did?</p>
<p><b>FATHER</b><br/>
  Hey, stop acting up!</p>
<p><i>This time, Willow deplaned right behind the family. She looks around desperately 
    for her friends, but they are nowhere to be found. She seems deflated and 
    disappointed.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Welcome home, me.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<p><b>8     EXT.     CONSTRUCTION 
    SITE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT<br/>
    A Teen Boy is spray-painting graffiti on a earth retention wall at the construction 
    site where dirt has been removed below the grade . He's painting the word 
    "Spider" when something unseen stalks him from the shadows.</b></p>
<p><b>GNARL (O.S.)<br/>
</b>All alone. (clicks fingernails together) Are you frightened to be all 
    alone?</p>
<p><b>TEEN BOY</b><br/>
  (stops painting) Is somebody there?</p>
<p><b>GNARL (O.S.)</b><br/>
  The wind talks when you're alone. (laughs)</p>
<p><b>TEEN BOY</b><br/>
  You better clear out, whoever you are.</p>
<p><i>There's a shrieking noise and then the boy screams.</i></p>

    Willow knocks on the outside back door, and when there's no answer she lets 
    herself in. </b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Buffy? Hello?</p>
<p><i>She walks into the other room. When she passes the microwave oven, its clock 
    says 10:41.</i></p>

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    The sign on Willow and Tara's old room says "Buffy." Willow goes 
    into the room and looks around sadly. Buffy has moved in. Willow walks toward 
    the window, touches it, and remembers the sound of Tara's fatal gunshot breaking 
    the glass. She looks at Buffy's pictures and sees pictures of all their friends, 
    except Willow herself. She picks up Buffy's day planner, which has contact 
    info for Buffy, Xander and Dawn. A dog barks outside, and there's a noise 
    like a front door opening. Willow drops the planner and rushes out of the 
    room.</b></p>

<p><b>13     INT.     HALL 
    STAIRCASE AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Willow's coming down the stairs excitedly, looking for her friends.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Dawn? Did I hear the door?</p>
<p><i>Again, no one is there. She walks into the living room disappointed.</i></p>

<p><b>16     INT.     FOYER 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy, Xander, and Dawn come home and enter through the front door, talking 
    about Willow. </b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  They absolutely put her on the plane in London.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  So, she got off in Chicago when they stopped?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  She could've caught a flight anywhere from there.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (crosses arms) Maybe she doubled back. Got off the plane in London after Giles 
  left.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Well, if she's doing that—ducking Giles—then, she's evil, right?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Well, I've avoided Giles tons of times. Just meant I was lazy, not evil.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I hope you're right, because defeating Lazy Willow—probably less hard.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    We should check the messages... see if she tried to reach us here.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  'S a good idea.</p>
<p><i>The sound of Willow dropping the planner comes from upstairs.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  What was that?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Upstairs.</p>
<p><b>17     INT.     HALL STAIRCASE 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Xander, Buffy and Dawn go up the stairs to investigate.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Willow, is that you?</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>18     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    A few minutes later, Buffy and Dawn come down the stairs. Xander is sitting 
    on the couch, and they go to sit down beside him.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Definitely not up there.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  She didn't leave a message.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I checked with Giles again, too. Hasn't heard from her.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Is he throwing a tasteful British wiggins?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Oh, with extra wig. He's blaming himself pretty hard, like he should've known 
  she wasn't ready to come back. I-I kept telling him, you know, it wasn't his 
  fault. Maybe something about us she couldn't face.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Like she didn't think we were ready to forgive her? I get that.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  So Giles is blaming Giles, and we're blaming us. Is anyone gonna blame Willow? 
  Oh, don't give me shock face. I mean, will anyone around here ever start asking 
  for help when they need it?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Look, if Willow flipped out, it's her bad. We can only be here for her so 
    much if she won't be, you know, here.</p>
<p><i>Shot of the couch. Xander, Dawn, and Buffy are sitting beside each other 
    on it. They begin to fade away, while another image appears in their place: 
    Willow is sleeping on the sofa they were talking on.</i></p>
<p><b>19     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Willow wakes up. She has apparently slept on the couch all night. It's morning 
    now. She gets up and goes to the phone and dials it.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Hello. I'm calling for Giles, uh, Mr. Giles. (pause) Right. Council meeting 
  all day. (pause) No, no, I know, he can't be reached there. Thanks. Bye.</p>

    what to do.</i></p>

    STREET IN FRONT OF MAGIC BOX - DAY<br/>
    Willow is walking down the bustling street toward the old Magic Box storefront. 
    It's burned and boarded up. Anya comes out the front door with a box full 
    of salvaged items. Willow runs up to her, excited to see her.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Anya!</p>
<p><i>Anya sees Willow and steps back defensively.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Anya, don't! Don't run away. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  What are you doing here? I thought you were with Giles studying how to not kill 
  people.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I just got back.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Just got back, as in you're all better, or just got back to bring about a fiery 
  apocalypse of death.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Neither, but I-I have been studying, working real hard, and I-I'm gonna be fine.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Oh. Good. 'Cause I remember the last time you said that. I've spent a lot 
    of time since them cleaning the debris out of my ex-livelihood. Stuff like 
    that.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Well, yeah, I wanna help any way I can with that. I-I feel really responsible.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (walks towards her) You feel really responsible? You are really responsible!</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I-I know I hurt you and—and everyone. I'm sorry.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Here's something you should know about vengeance demons: We don't group with 
  the "sorry." We prefer "Oh, God, please stop hitting me with 
  my own rib bones."</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Go on. Say whatever you want. Rib bones and so forth. I-I deserve it.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Then you won't mind? (Willow shakes her head no) Well, then, that's no fun.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Sorry.</p>
<p><i>Willow sits down on the curb side in front of the store. Anya sighs, puts 
    the box she's holding down beside Willow and sits down next to it. Willow 
    picks up a large, three-horned animal skull from the box to play with while 
    she talks.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  So, um, where is everyone these days?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Well, I'm back in my own apartment. And, of course, vengeance takes me all over 
  the world. I was in Brazil yesterday. They love their soccer.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  And the others? Dawn, and, uh, Xander, Buffy?</p>
<p><i>Willow accidentally breaks off one of the prongs on the skill, and quickly 
    puts it back in the box.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  You haven't seen them?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Not so much.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Huh. I guess they're still mad at you. They've been a little temperamental lately, 
  just between you and me. We had this little mix-up a few days ago, and —</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  That sounds great. So, um, where do you think they'd be?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Oh, at the new high school, probably. Everyone's all about the high school. 
  Buffy's got some kind of job there helping junior deviants, Spike's insane in 
  the basement, Xander's there doing construction on the new gym—</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Wait, Spike's what in the whatment?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Insane. Base. Xander does construction. He likes to start early, so he's probably 
  there by now.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>21     EXT.     CONSTRUCTION 
    SITE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY<br/>
    Willow walks up to the edge of the pit where they're doing construction. Willow 
    calls out over the site, looking around for Xander.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Xander? Xander, you down there?</p>
<p><i>No answer, so she climbs down the retaining wall on a ladder. This is the 
    retaining wall that the Teen Boy was painting last night. Willow walks around 
    and stops suddenly when she looks down. Zoom to a dead person lying on the 
    ground with no skin.</i></p>
<p><b>22     EXT.     CONSTRUCTION 
    SITE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY<br/>
    Zoom back up to where Willow was standing, but now there's Buffy and Xander 
    instead.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No skin.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Tough to look at.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  And yet my eyes refuse to look away. Stupid eyes.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    I found it first thing this morning. I gave my crew the day off, and I called 
    you right away. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I got to get a job where I don't get called right away for this stuff.</p>
<p><i>Xander wipes his mouth. There's a clanking noise coming from behind him. 
    On camera, a panicked Willow climbs the ladder to leave the site, but when 
    Xander turns to look at the noise behind him, he sees only an empty ladder. 
    He turns back to look at the dead person, and continues talking to Buffy.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Yeah, I know exactly what you're thinking. Maybe Willow is back.</p>
<p><b>Fade to black.</b></p>
<h3>ACT II.</h3>
<p><b>23     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Students are walking around in the hallways between classes. Willow is walking 
    down the hall as well. The bell rings, and the students rush to their classes. 
    She finds the basement door that reads "Basement. No Student Access." 
    She opens the door and walks down the stairs into the basement.</b></p>
<p><b>24     INT.     BASEMENT 
    SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Willow walks around the basement looking around. There are spare bookshelves 
    and other classroom equipment stored there. Then Spike jumps out from out 
    of nowhere and yells at her.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE<br/>
</b>Out! This is my place. You need permission to be here. You need a special 
    slip with a stamp.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Spike. My God... I— </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (ranting, pacing) You go off and try to wall up the bad parts and put your heart 
  back in where it fell out. You call yourself finished, but you're not. Worse 
  than ever, you are...</p>
<p><i>Spike stops pacing and stands still with his head tilted down a little. 
    He's silent and pensive. Then he walks forward with a confused expression 
    on his face. In an entirely different demeanor, more restrained and calm, 
    he starts talking again, but not facing Willow.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  You went away. You've been gone since...</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I needed to go, but I'm back now. And I found... There's a body.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Tragedy. (faces Willow) Is there blood?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Uh, I, Yeah, and I can't find Buffy or Xander or Dawn. And there's this thing 
  killing people. And the victim was... skinned. What could do that?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  You did it once. I heard about it.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Anything other—other than me?</p>
<p><i>Spike is not facing Willow, but instead, he's facing ninety degrees away 
    from her. Smiling sweetly all of a sudden, he's no longer talking to her.

  "Gnarl." He's a parasite with these nasty long fingernails. He secretes 
  something through them and uses that to paralyze his victims. He then cuts strips 
  of their skin while they're still alive. It takes hours.</p>

  We didn't find any strips of skin. Which, by the way, (shudders) gghhhh!</p>

  (sighs) OK, I'm gonna check the computer. Find that page. See if there's an 
  antidote.</p>
<p><i>Buffy leaves the room.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  It'll be all right. We'll get you fixed up. You'll be doing limbo in no time.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Yeah, as a pole.</p>

  No, not as a pole. I promise.</p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Oh, got it. It says the paralysis is permanent. (Dawn squeaks) No, oh, wait, 
  my bad. (reading) Permanent until the creature dies. (looks over) Sorry.</p>
<p><i>Buffy walks back into the living room.</i></p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Guess we have to go back.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  We can't just leave her here like this. What if she vomits?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (without moving mouth) Ew. I won't vomit. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Do you think she'll vomit?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (without moving mouth) Stop talking about vomit.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    Gnarl is still squatting over Willow, playing with her stomach with his fingernail.</b></p>
<p><b>GNARL</b><br/>
  Gnarl makes a pretty picture. (scratches her again) It's easy when you know 
  how. It's easy when everyone helps. They helped me. (licks her blood off his 
  fingernail) Too bad there's no one to help you.</p>
<p><i>Gnarl removes a strip of skin about the size of a French fry from her stomach. 
    He dangles it over his mouth and sucks it in like spaghetti, savoring every 
    morsel of her raw flesh. He groans with pleasure and bends over to lick her 
    stomach again. Willow's face shows her agony.</i></p>

    Anya has arrived to look after Dawn. Buffy and Xander are getting ready to 
    fight Gnarl.</b></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I bet she's dying.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  She's not dying. She's just paralyzed.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Oh. Paralyzed how?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Paralyzed how? In the not moving way.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Well, there's lots of different ways. Did you try this?</p>
<p><i>Anya takes Dawn's legs and lifts them up ninety degrees, bending her at 
    the waist. Her legs don't fall back down.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Hey!</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (without moving her lips) Hey!</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Oh! You're poseable.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  She's poseable?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  It's a common variety. Watch this.</p>
<p><i>Anya rearranges Dawn so that she's sitting on the couch now, upright.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Huh. Neat as you please. Hardly a need to undo her.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (mouthful of nuts) Where'd you get the nuts?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Brazil. No need to thank me, by the way, for sitting with her. I'm feeling 
    very benevolent today. Helping Willow. Helping you. You might even call it 
    even for that whole worm thing last week.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Yeah, I don't think we could call— Wait, you saw Willow?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Um-hmm. Oh, she's looking for you, by the way. Decided you might be out in some 
  cave. Sounded pretty tenuous.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (without moving her lips) Cave?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Anya, listen. This is really important. Did Willow go to that cave?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Mm-hmm. Last time I saw her, that's where she was headed. (turning to Dawn) 
  Shall I make her salute? That'd be very cute.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Xander, she could be there right now. Willow could be trapped with the Gnarl.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (playing with Dawn's hand) Uh, it's not "The Gnarl", just "Gnarl". 
  Oh, wouldn't it be tragic if you were here being kinda silly with your comically 
  paralyzed sister while Willow was dying?</p>
<p><i>Buffy walks over to Anya, with a battle-axe in hand.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Anya, you know about this creature?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Uh-huh, sure.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You're coming with us.</p>
<p><i>Buffy hands the battle-axe to Anya, who looks it over. Anya finishes posing 
    Dawn in a two-finger salute, pats Dawn on the head, and walks off. Dawn grunts 
    with displeasure. Buffy and Xander walked out as well, but Buffy runs back 
    in to place the remote in Dawn's posed hand before leaving again. Dawn squeaks.</i></p>

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

<p><b>GNARL</b><br/>
  (laughing) They don't want you. (singing) Lock you in, nice white skin... (talking) 
  And if they do return, where will the find you? Inside me, you'll already be. 
  (cutting a new piece of skin from her belly) Aww... love it. </p>
<p><i>Gnarl pulls out the next piece of skin to eat, and laps up her blood from 
    the wound.</i></p>

  What? Where? (feels around with his hand) There's nothing here.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Your hand—it's going right through her. (to Buffy) What's going on?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I don't know, but I'm starting to get why we haven't seen her.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Because we haven't seen her.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I have this feeling that whatever's causing this invisible thing is a whole 
  separate issue from the skin-eating monster.</p>

<p><i>Gnarl tries to scratch Buffy, but misses, getting only her shirt and not 
    her skin.</i></p>

    at each other.</i></p>

  here. Wow, you're really hurt.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

    his head with both hands and plunges her thumbs into his eyes. </i></p>

    Willow's sitting on the bed in pajamas in Buffy's old bedroom, meditating. 
    Buffy walks up to the doorway, sees her, and decides not to interrupt her. 
    Willow opens her eyes. </b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Buffy...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  That's all I had left in me anyway.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I didn't realize meditating was such hard work.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I'm healing. Growing new skin.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (walks toward Willow) Wow. That's magic, right? I mean, when most people when 
  they meditate don't get extra skin, right. 'Cause Clem should, like, cut back. 
  (sits on edge of bed)</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  It's magic. I'm drawing power from the earth to heal myself.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  We're on the second floor.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (laughs) You know Giles says everything's part of the earth. This bed. The air. 
  Us.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Explains why my fingernails get dirty even when I don't do anything.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Plus you stuck your thumbs in a demon.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  True.</p>
<p><i>Willow leans back, exhausted.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You're wiped out. I-I should go.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  No. Please stay. I missed you so much when I couldn't find you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  We missed you too. I missed you. Dawn's, uh, working on what caused the mutual 
  no-see-ums, but so far we haven't—</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I did it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You did a spell?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I didn't mean to. I-I just remember thinking I wasn't ready to see you guys 
  yet. I was afraid we wouldn't, you know, connect.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  So, you made it happen just by thinking it?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Guess I have a ways to go before I master my powers, huh?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It's OK. As long as you're all right.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  It's nice to be forgiven. Too bad I need so much of it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I have a confession to make. I thought it might be you. With the flaying.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I know.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I wanna be the kind of person that wouldn't think that. Xander never thought 
  it.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  He did, a little. Heck, I did a little. Xander has the luxury of not saying 
  it, but you're the slayer. You have to say stuff like that. It's OK. It's OK 
  too if you still don't think I can recover from this magic stuff, 'cause, honestly, 
  I'm not that sure about it either.</p>
<p><i>Willow leans forward again, sighing, to begin meditating again.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I thought you were too tired.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  It hurts too much not to try.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I'm sorry.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  It just takes so much strength. I don't have that much.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I got so much strength, I'm giving it away.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Are you sure?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Will it help?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Much.</p>
<p><i>Buffy sits cross-legged in front of Willow and holds her hands. They meditate 
    together.</i></p>
