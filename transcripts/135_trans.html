<p><b>1     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Dawn's standing in front of the three girls Giles brought with him. The three 
    girls are lined up against the wall, and Dawn's inspecting them, arms crossed 
    in front of her. Willow, Anya, Xander, Buffy and Giles are also in the room, 
    gathered for a pow-wow.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    The First. That's what it wants.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    To erase all the slayers in training and their watchers, along with their 
    methods.</p>

    AN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT<br/>
    Holding the young woman in an embrace, Spike rears back in vampire face and 
    sinks his fangs into her neck. He drops the woman to the ground and turns 
    his bloody, fanged face to the camera.</b></p>

    Spike is sitting in a chair, wrapped in a blanket while the others talk in 
    an adjacent room. Buffy, Xander, Anya, Willow and Dawn are all there. Spike's 
    listening to them.</b></p>

<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    It's a trigger. It's a brainwashing term. It's how the military makes sleeper 
    agents.</p>

<p><b>PROFESSOR WALSH</b><br/>
    Agent Finn, my implant?</p>

    The implant works. Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature in any way without 
    intense neurological pain.</p>

    You think you can just do that to me?</p>

<h3><b>PROLOGUE:</b></h3>
<p><b>11     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Giles scurries into the living room, where Buffy and Dawn are sitting on the 
    couch.</b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Are you sure you'll all be all right?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    You'll only be gone for two days. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I think we've managed a bit longer than that.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Right. (looks around nervously, stops) Oh, Dawn, Vi's left her notebook on 
    the mantelpiece. Would you mind running it out to the car?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (stands, goes to the fireplace) Sure.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    While you're at it, you smack her in the head with it and remind her not to 
    leave it lying around.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (walks out the front door with the notebook) On it.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (sits on coffee table in front of Buffy) I'm just a bit twitchy about leaving 
    you alone again here while—while things are (takes of glasses, wipes 
    his brow) in such a state of flux.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I know. But you should go. This trip is important for the girls to understand 
    the source of their power, and to know how to use it right.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Do you think they appreciate the gravity of what we're undertaking? It's frightening, 
    and it's difficult. And then, apparently, someone told them that the vision 
    quest consists of me driving them to the desert, doing the hokey pokey until 
    a spooky Rasta-mama slayer arrives and speaks to them in riddles. (looks at 
    Buffy)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (looks innocent) That's not exactly how I put it, I— (sees Willow come 
    down stairs and enter the room) Hey, how's Kennedy?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Still fluey. Bummed about missing the field trip. (to Giles) She says she 
    wants you to meditate extra hard for her and to bring her back some smores. 
    (grins)</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Ah yes. Smores. I'm going to end up singing campfire songs aren't I? (stands)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (comes in the front door, followed by Dawn) Giles, you might want to get out 
    there.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Oh, God, what?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Molly and Rona are fighting over who gets to drive the first leg.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (to Giles) Bet you wish you renewed that California state driver's license 
    now, huh?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (comes in the front door) Rona won. You should probably let Molly out of the 
    trunk. (car horn blows outside, Anya walks to the kitchen with Willow) I never 
    actually realized just how compact Molly really is.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (sighs, to Buffy) Please be safe while I'm away.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You too.</p>

<p><b>12     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Buffy walks downstairs to the basement, toward where Spike is sitting on a 
    cot, his wrists chained to the wall.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Hey.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Hey.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Giles is off ...on the retreat.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Give us all a chance for a breather, eh?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    From Giles?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    From the constant pitter patter of clomping teenage girly feet.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (shrugs) I have no idea what you're talking about. </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Come on.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, I enjoy my responsibility as mentor, role model, life guide—oh, my 
    God, I cannot believe I have my bathroom all to myself for two whole days. 
    (sits on the cot beside Spike) </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (leans forward) It's like a bloody war-zone up there, and not in a good way.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Have you seen the kitchen since they've been here?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I'm just trying to stay out of their way.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (glances at his chains) I noticed.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (looks at his chains) This is better. Believe me, it's safer.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    OK. But you've been fine. In close contact with the girls.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (looks at Buffy) With you by my side, yeah. You won't let me hurt one of them. 
    And that's the way it's gonna be until we're sure the First is done making 
    me its bitch. Either we're together, or I'm on the leash.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    We just need to make sure the trigger's deactivated then. We've got a couple 
    of days, lack of pitter-patter and all...</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (leans forward, looking at her earnestly) Buffy...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Ow.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Ow?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (his face contorts, twitching) Ow ow ow! (leans back, thrashes against the 
    wall)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What's wrong? (Spike puts his hands to his head) Spike, what is going on?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (calmer now) The chip. God. Why would—? (screams) Aaahhh! (holds his 
    hands to his head, writhing in intense pain)</p>

<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>13     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    A tea kettle whistles as Buffy walks into the kitchen from the basement. Willow's 
    at the stove.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Hey. How is he?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (sits) Oh, in the "goes" part of "comes and goes."</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Well there seems to be a definite lack of screaming. That has to be good.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You'd think. (Willow pours hot water into a cup) That for the other patient?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Yeah. Thought I'd bring her some tea, help her feel better.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (smiling, teasingly) Mm-hmm?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    It's just tea.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (giggles, then pauses) Will, how much do you know about the chip?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Spike's chip? Well, I remember trying to dig up stuff back then, but, you 
    know, turns out, when a secret government agency studies vampires and puts 
    chips in their brains that keep them from hurting people, they don't really 
    build websites. Why?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Even with the chip, Spike was able to hurt all those people when he was brainwashed.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Yeah, but he was under the control of the First.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Maybe something's wrong with it.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    The chip is misfiring all on its own, then. Well this'll be fun.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Remember when things used to be nice and boring?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (shrugs) No. (walks out of the kitchen with tea in hand)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (teasingly, calls after her) Have fun...delivering tea...</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (stops, turns around) OK, not when you make it sound all dirty like that. 
    (mumbles as she heads upstairs) It's just tea.</p>

    Willow walks into her room to find Kennedy putting on her shoes.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Hey, I figured the best thing for a cold is a nice hot cup of...(frowns) boots?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Hey.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    For someone who's sick, you look surprisingly robust and casual dressy.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Well, the lighting in here is good. Maybe it's just—</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (shocked) You were never sick!</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    No...I was never sick.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Oh, you are so busted. Xander's gonna have to drive you to the desert and—</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Willow, chill. (stands) There's a reason I didn't go. I have a thing. A separate 
    thing.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    What?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (puts on her coat) Something's coming down. I have my own mission. And I need 
    you help.</p>

    A band's playing a song on stage.</b></p>
<p><b>BAND</b><br/>
    (singing) So I can be happy again...</p>
<p><i>Kennedy and Willow are having a drink (complete with orange wedge and 
    paper umbrella garnishes), sitting at one of the tables, listening to the 
    band.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    This is a mission?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Oh! Yeah...</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    And the little pink umbrellas are a signal for what? We're not on a mission, 
    are we?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Hey, trust me, I told you. I have a thing. (Willow gets up to leave, Kennedy 
    calls after her) Come on, come on. Just hang out with me a little. (Willow 
    turns to face her, sighing) You're sexy when you pout.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Why do you do that?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (pouts) To get you to stay.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (returns to the table, sits) All right, I'll stay for one drink, then I'm 
    going home.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    OK. One drink. I can work with that. Let's start with the easy stuff. How 
    long have you known? That you're gay.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Wait. That's easy? (fidgets) And you just assume that I'm—I'm gay. I 
    mean, presume much?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (grins) OK. How long have you enjoyed having sex with women?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (taken aback) Hey! (Kennedy chuckles) What you think you have some special 
    lesbidar or something?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    OK, you know there's a better word for that, right? (Willow sips her drink) 
    You really haven't been getting out there much, have you?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Well, I just—can you always tell just—just by looking at someone?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    No. No, of course not. That wouldn't be any fun. The fun part is the process 
    of—of getting to know a girl. It's like—it's like flirting in code. 
    It's using body language and laughing at the right jokes and—and looking 
    into her eyes and knowing she's still whispering to you, even when she's not 
    saying a word. And that sense that if you can just touch her just once everything 
    will be OK for both of you. That's how you can tell. (sits back, grins) Or 
    if she's really hot, you just get her drunk—see if she comes on to you.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Three years ago. That's when I knew. And it wasn't women, it was woman. Just 
    one. </p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Lucky woman. (smiles)</p>

<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Popped another blood vessel, I think. (Buffy hands him a towel; he wipes blood 
    from his nose)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    There's gotta be a reason why the chip is going all wonky. Maybe it's related 
    to the trigger or maybe it has something to do with the new soul.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Or maybe I wasn't meant to last this long. (beat) One more thing you and I 
    have in common, eh, pet?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Well, we'll fix it. We'll hit serious research mode—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Good. Try <u>Behavioral Modification Software Throughout the Ages</u>.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (sighs) OK. You're right. Not a book thing. It's a phone thing.</p>

    No, no, Finn is his last name. Yeah. Well, did he used to work there and then 
    he got transferred? (Spike's chip goes off again, he thrashes on the stairs 
    unnoticed by Buffy) Oh, is this actually a flower shop, or is this one of 
    those things where I'm supposed to play along to show that I know it's really 
    secret ops? Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that. Oh, OK, right. Well, if 
    some guy named Finn shows up to buy flowers— Yeah. Thanks. (hangs up,

<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    It was <u>Gone with the Wind</u>. I saw that, and I knew I wanted to sweep 
    Scarlet off her feet.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    You were five.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Well, I'm not saying the sweeping would have been easy... (smiles, eats the 
    cherry off her paper umbrella garnish) What?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I just—I still don't get it. (shrugs) Why you like me. I mean, you don't 
    even know me. </p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Have you seen you? (Willow blushes) And we like the same things—Italian, 
    skate punk, Robert Parker mysteries, fighting evil...</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (smiles, shakes her head) I don't like any of that stuff. Except the—the 
    fighting evil part. Even then, I prefer a nice foot massage.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    OK, I dig the way you always turn off the Moulin Rouge DVD at Chapter 32 so 
    it has a happy ending. (Willow laughs) I like the way you speak. It's interesting. 
    (Willow smiles) And your freckles...likeable. (Willow blushes) I'm not so 
    into the magic stuff. It seems like fairy tale crap to me, but if it matters 
    to you... You care about it, so it's cool. </p>

<p><b>20     INT.     WILLOW'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Willow walks into her bedroom, Kennedy waits at the door. The mood is very 
    awkward.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Well, this is my stop. (turns on light) So...glad we talked. </p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (walks into the room, toward Willow, nods) Yes. Kinda cleared the air.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (nods) Yeah, totally. Air cleared. Check. </p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (standing in front of Willow now) You know, in the spirit of air clearing...</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Yeah?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    I feel like I need to be honest about something.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I-is something wrong?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    No. (shakes head) No, it's just— (walks closer to Willow) I think (leans 
    in for a kiss) you should know... </p>
<p><i>Kennedy kisses Willow slowly, passionately. The camera circles them as 
    they kiss, showing Willow's hair, then Kennedy's hair—then Willow's hair 
    is gone as the kiss ends. Where Willow was, Warren's now standing.</i></p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    Well, that was nice.</p>
<p><i>Kennedy pulls back from him, panicked. She stumbles and falls as she retreats, 
    knocking over a lamp.</i></p>

    Resume. Willow's standing where Warren was a moment ago, talking to Kennedy, 
    who is staring incredulously at her.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Are you OK? (chuckles nervously) I'm not used to literally knocking girls 
    off of their feet with just the power of my own lips. </p>
<p><i>Kennedy just stares at Willow, confused.</i></p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    OK, you gonna pick that up, or...?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    I don't—what are you?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Is this a freckle thing, 'cause— </p>
<p><i>Willow starts to panic and goes to look in the mirror; she sees Warren's 
    reflection instead of her own.</i></p>

    in the living room. </b></p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    OK, hold up a sec.</p>
<p><i>When Xander, Anya and Dawn see Warren, they gasp and stand, positioning 
    themselves defensively.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    Guys—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Get Buffy. Get Buffy. Tell her the First is back.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    No, I'm not the First.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    We're not interested in any of your evil lies. We've heard 'em all.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW*/WARREN</b><br/>
    No, guys it's me. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    I'm me. I'm Willow. Guys, come on. As Kennedy— (points to Kennedy) she 
    was there.</p>

    and we were—-</p>
<p><i>Carrying a bowl of food, Andrew walks into the living room. When he sees 
    Warren, he freezes in place, dropping his bowl; it shatters to pieces on the

    No... No. You're back.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    (emphatic) No, I'm not. It's not— I'm not it. Listen to me—</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    No more listening. I know who you are now. I know what you made me do. Your 
    promises of happy fields and dancing schnauzers and being demigods won't work 
    on me anymore.</p>

<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Are you sure?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW*/WARREN</b><br/>
    There are other stories from kindergarten. Non yellow crayon stories in which 
    you don't come out in such a good light. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    An incident involving Aquaman underoos, for example. You want me to start 
    talking?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (smiles, walks up to Willow/Warren) Hey, Willow!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    What happened?</p>
<p><i>Everyone inches closer to Willow/Warren.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    I don't know. We were there, and then I looked like him.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Oh, like a glamour.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    Maybe, but I probably brought it on myself.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What makes you think that?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    Well, it wouldn't be the first time. I have a history with my witchy subconscious 
    making things go kerfloopey. Remember the wacky "I can't see you, you 
    can't see me" spell?</p>
<p><i>While Willow/Warren's talking, Dawn touches his shoulder, Andrew touches 
    his chest and face.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (to Dawn and Andrew) Guys!</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (stops touching Willow/Warren) It's so real.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    I'm all too aware. (brushes Dawn's hand away.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    OK, say you're right, and you did do this to yourself. Why would your subconscious 
    turn you into Warren?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    Obviously because I feel bad—about killing him.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    We'll deal. We'll get help.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    No, I can handle this.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    On your own? Why?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    I did it. I'll fix it. I don't want you seeing me this way anyway. (walks 
    toward the door)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It's kinda a little late for that. (Spike's moaning in the background)</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    Seriously, I'm not posing any big threat to the world. Looks like you've got 
    your hands full already. </p>
<p><i>Buffy looks around, sees Spike lying on the floor moaning and twitching.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW*/WARREN</b><br/>
    I'll go, I'll handle it, I'll fix it, I'll be back before you even know I'm 
    gone. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    Promise. (leaves through the front door) </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (goes to his side) Spike. (kneels down beside him)</p>

    Buffy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I'm right here.</p>

<p><i>Xander, Anya, Dawn and Andrew gather around to watch Buffy and Spike.

    Willow/Warren's walking purposefully down the street. Kennedy walks up to 
    her, surprising her. </b></p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    OK. Safe to say no one will ever accuse you of being too butch.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    Kennedy, go home. (walks away)</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (follows) Come on. I mean, you turned into a guy. I mean if you take a step 
    back, seriously, there's a certain element of humor here, right? (Willow/Warren 
    stops walking, turns and glares at her) Well, a really, really big step.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    I killed him. It's hard to see the chuckles. (walks away)</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (follows) So you got a plan?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW*/WARREN</b><br/>
    Yeah, get some help reversing it.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    I thought you were gonna try it yourself.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW*/WARREN</b><br/>
    I did try. Something's blocking me.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    All the more reason for me to go with you. Plus, I was there when it happened. 
    Lemme come to try to help too.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>
    (stops walking) I really think I'm fine with the handling.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    By yourself? Why?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW*/WARREN</b><br/>
    I'm the one that killed him. I— It's hard to understand. </p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Given. How 'bout I just tag along anyway. Keep you company. (Willow/Warren 
    sighs) I'm taking that as a yes.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW/WARREN*</b><br/>

<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I don't know. (digs through the dirt) Worked pretty good when the Initiative 
    held me captive here. Every time I'd get a little...rambunctious, the chip'd 
    kick in. I feel like my head was gonna explode. They'd dope me up, and everything 
    would be all daffodils and teddy bears. For a couple of hours anyway.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    Xander and the fireplace. The phone rings.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    I'll get it. (stands) I'm supposed to get a call when the new League of Extraordinary 
    Gentlemen comes in. I gave them this number.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Ooh. Can you see if you can get two?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Summers residence, this is Andrew speaking. How can I help you?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (realizes that Dawn and Anya are staring at him, looks at Andrew) Loser.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (holds his hand over the phone) Hey, do we know some British guy named Robson?</p>
<p><i>Time passes. Xander hangs up the phone and reports to Dawn and Anya.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    He was attacked, this Robson guy in England. (sits) And Giles was there helping 
    him. And there was a Bringer. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (leans forward) Xander...</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Robson blacked out, but the last thing he remembers is Giles's head about 
    to get really familiar with a Bringer's very sharp axe. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Oh, my God! </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Giles never mentioned any of this.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Robson said by the time he came to, there was no Giles.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    So, what are we saying?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Maybe Giles just didn't want to talk about it.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Or maybe he didn't make it. Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but 
    we're dealing with a big bad that can be any dead person it wants. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Because if you want to infiltrate the inner circle of the slayer...</p>

    Become the one person she trusts more than anybody else.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    But there's no way that we can know.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Actually that's not true. The First can't take corporeal form, so it can't 
    touch anything.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Oh, it's not like Giles hasn't touched anything, right? (thinks, looks expectantly 
    at everyone else) Ha-has anyone seen Giles touch anything since he got back?

<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    What? Why? 'Cause I used to be evil?</p>

    No, actually, 'cause you're annoying, but that's a good reason too. (turns 
    toward the door)</p>

    It's not a trick, it's not a glamour. I'm becoming him. A murderous, misogynist

    kiss. You must be good.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Answer me.</p>
<p><b>AMY</b><br/>
    The hex I cast lets the victim's subconscious pick the form of their punishment. 
    It's always better than anything I can come up with. Elegant, you know?</p>

    Why would you do this to her? You really hate her that much?</p>
<p><b>AMY</b><br/>
    (sighs) This is not about hate. It's about power. Willow always had all the 
    power, long before she even knew what to do with it. Just came so easy for 
    her. The rest of us—we had to work twice as hard to be half as good. 
    But no one cares about how hard you work. They just care about cute, sweet 
    Willow. They don't know how weak she is. She gave in to evil—stuff worse 
    than I can even imagine— She almost destroyed the world! And yet everyone 
    keeps on loving her? (in Kennedy's face) So what's wrong with having a little 
    fun, huh? Taking her down a peg or two?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Fun? (Amy nods) She's disappearing. Fading away in that creep, and you think 
    it's fun.</p>
<p><b>AMY</b><br/>
    It was just a game. It's not my fault if she's losing herself.</p>
