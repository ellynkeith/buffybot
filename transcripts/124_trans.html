<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p><b>20     EXT.      NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT<br/>
  Loud techno music is playing. A bright blue neon sign is pointing to the club, 
  that reads "Tatoo Nachtlocal." Zoom down to street level, where a 
  sign points to "Parkplatz." We see a car driving toward the building. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>TITLE CARD: Frankfurt, Germany</b></p>
<p><b>Zoom back up to the third floor where we can see through the glass hallway. 
  Zoom inside.</b></p>
<p><b>21     INT.      PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT<br/>
  A girl is running and looks scared. She has hot pink hair with black bangs at 
  her forehead, a nose ring, and a metal collar. She's wearing all black, with 
  a skeleton shirt, long pants, a leather jacket and boots. She goes through an 
  interior door and jumps down to the next level. Two people are chasing her. 
  They look suspiciously like the robed men from episode 7x01 "Lessons". 
  We can't see any details of their bodies, just the hooded cloaks that completely 
  cover them. She runs out through an exterior door and proceeds to scale down 
  the building. Finally, she thinks she's safe when she goes through a doorway 
  to the outside near a crowd of club patrons, but she is pushed back inside by 
  her pursuers. They close the door behind them and start to fight with her. She 
  is knocked to the ground, lying on her back. Finally, one of the robed people 
  pulls out a curved silver dagger and tries to stab her, but she blocks his move. 
  The other robed person also has a dagger though and stabs her. She winces, and 
  the men resheath their daggers and leave. After the girl appears dead, she turns 
  her head to look directly in the camera and speaks in a low, unnatural sounding 
  voice.</b></p>
<p><b>GERMAN GIRL</b><br/>
  From beneath you, it devours.</p>

<p><b>22     INT.      BUFFY'S 
    BEDROOM IN BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
  Buffy screams. </b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY (O.S.) </b><br/>
  Ah!</p>
<p><i>Dawn is sitting beside Buffy, leaning over her, trying to wake her up.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Buffy! Buffy! Buffy!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I heard screaming.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  That was you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  There was a girl.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  That would be me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Uh, no. It was...</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Just a dream. It was just a dream, right? </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  From beneath you, it devours. That's what she said, and then they... There's 
  more like her, Dawn. Out there somewhere.</p>
<p><i>Buffy and Dawn get up off the bed and go to look out the window, frowning 
  sadly.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  And they're gonna die. </p>
<p><b>Zoom out the window to the street.</b></p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>23     EXT.      NEIGHBORHOOD 
    STREET - NIGHT<br/>
  We see grass and hear rumbling noises coming from underground. The force is 
  progressing along a path, like it's caused by something specific that is moving 
  purposefully underground. Shrubs are shaking and a birdbath falls over. Then 
  the sidewalk is pushed up from underneath, cracking. A curvy line is cut down 
  the street.</b></p>
<p><b>Opening credits and title sequence.</b></p>
<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<p><b>24     INT.      BASEMENT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Water is dripping down the walls, like in a typical basement. Zoom to cute 
    rat sitting on boxes in foreground. The rat squeaks. Zoom to background, crouched 
    behind some boxes, Spike is stalking the rat, crawling slowly toward it between 
    the boxes.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE<br/>
</b>No, no, no, no, no, no. Now is not the time. You know it. I know it. But 
  making them understand... is a totally different matter. No manners is the problem. 
  Proper breeding. Lack of etiquette. All of it lacking. All of it lost on them. 
</p>
<p><i>There's a rumbling sound, then the ground starts to shake. Spike stands 
  and looks around alarmed. </i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Not the time. Not hardly ready. </p>
<p><i>He starts to wince.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Stop. Please, mum! Begging now! Make it stop! Oh, God! </p>
<p><i>Spike holds his hands over his ears trying to block out the sounds. He screams 
  in agony.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Ooh! Aaahhhh!</p>

<p><b>25     INT.      XANDER'S CAR - DAY<br/>
  Dawn is in the backseat of Xander's four-door sedan. Xander's driving, and Buffy 
  is the passenger. Xander is driving Buffy and Dawn to school.</b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Could you die? 'Cause, seriously, speaking for everybody who are me in the car 
  right now, we're very excited.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Well, I'm glad for all of you then.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  I mean, it's just so cool. You're coming to school with me. You'll be, like, 
  there the whole time. (pauses) You understand you cannot talk to me, look at 
  me, or hang out with any of my friends, right?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Look, I doubt we'll be seeing each other, assuming I even half-understand my 
  fuzzy job description.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  It's not fuzzy. You're, what, dealing with troubled kids?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  At a spanking new Hellmouth High. Please. Outside of drugs and violence and 
  the unwanted pregnancy, and, uh, unleashing of hordes of Armageddon that comes 
  pouring out of the school's foundation every now and then, what trouble could 
  these kids have?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Guess I'll find out.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Those kids are damn lucky having a slayer and a friend on campus there for 'em. 
  I hope they appreciate it. I know I did. (pauses) Days gone by, huh?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  I thought you hated Sunnydale.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Yes, and no, with an emphasis on the yes. But, at least then I was dating.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You could be dating now.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Yeah. Um, I don't know what's not clicking for me right now.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Well, there's that thing with Anya.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  That leaving her at the altar thing?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Yeah, that one. That's not something you bounce right back from.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Sure it is. She bounced back to being a vengeance demon, and I bounced back 
  to being a dateless nerd.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Do you guys talk at all?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I've seen her at the Bronze a couple of times. I guess there's a lot of scorned 
  women there, making vengeance wishes on their exes.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (Southern accent) I know that's where I go to get my scorn on.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  You guys need to really to ease up with the whole dating demons thing.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Uh, hello, I'm sorry. Wasn't that you having the smooch-a-thon with teen vampire 
  last Halloween?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  See, this is why I don't want you talking to my friends. (sighs) Oh. </p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>26     INT.      BUFFY'S OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - 
  DAY<br/>
  Principal Wood is showing her around on her first day at work. Buffy has a cubicle 
  near a hallway window. They enter the office area from the hallway.</b></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL<br/>
</b>We'll sort of feel our way around. Some students will be sent to you, and 
  others, I'm hoping, will start to come in on their own.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  What if they don't? Should I panic?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  You'll be surprised, Buffy. You're the youngest, and, uh, least stuffy member 
  of this faculty. I think the students are gonna want to come in and talk to 
  you. And when they do, don't evaluate them. Just listen. They need to feel like 
  there's someone around here who actually understands them.</p>
<p><i>While Buffy looks out the window nearest her cubicle, she gets an exciting 
  idea.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Can I give detention?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  OK by me. A little authority can be a wonderful thing. Just remember that while 
  you are here to help, you're not here to be their friend. Trust me, you open 
  that door, and these students will eat you alive.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You heard about Principal Flutie, right?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Hmm?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Forget it.</p>
<p><i>Buffy sits down at her desk and starts to get situated.</i></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  OK then. And, Buffy, relax. There's only three things these kids understand: 
  the boot, the bat, and the bastinada. (chuckles) </p>
<p><i>Buffy doesn't laugh, but instead gives him a blank stare.</i></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  It's the... it's a... it's a bad joke. It's the bastinada. No one ever knows 
  what that thing is.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Wooden rod to slap the soles of the feet in Turkish prisons, but if made with 
  the correct wood makes an awesome Billy club.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  I think you're gonna fit in just fine. Is there something else?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Um, yeah. Uh, just one more thing. (stands) I was, uh, just curious, you know, 
  uh—not that I'm not grateful or anything. But, uh, I guess I was wondering 
  why I—</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Have this job?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I still haven't finished college.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  I know.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Was it my sparkling personality? Or maybe you enjoyed my work at the Doublemeat 
  Palace?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  I'm a vegetarian. These students need someone around here who understands them, 
  and I need someone who understands these students. Why? Is there something about 
  you that I don't know that maybe I should?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Nothing I can think of.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Oh, if you'll excuse me. First catch of the day. I'll be in my office if you 
  need me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Thanks. I'm just gonna have a look around. Get to know the place. Make sure 
  it's all... school-like.</p>

  Willow is sitting on a suitcase in an exterior doorway, talking to Giles who 
  walks up the interior hallway toward her and leans with one arm on the doorjamb 
  over her head. They are both facing the same direction, looking out at the countryside.</b></p>
<p><b>TITLE CARD: Westbury, England</b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  The taxi's here.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I know.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  And in keeping with a quaint old Birtish tradition, you would now be expected 
  to get into it.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I don't know if I can. Giles, I'm not done here.</p>
<p>Walks around to talk to her face-to-face, leans on the opposite doorjamb.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  That's your fear talking.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Yes, and my fear's a big, obnoxious blabbermouth. You're the one that keeps 
  telling me to trust my instincts.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  True.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  So, shouldn't we be listening? I don't want to go back home just so I can screw 
  up again. I Why don't I stay? Not forever. Just long enough to, I don't know, 
  make my fear shut up a little, maybe?</p>
<p><i>Taxi honks. Giles steps outside and waves to acknowledge it. He faces Willow 
  again.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  It's possible, but... Try to be very specific. What exactly are you afraid of?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Well, for starters, how 'bout the hellmouth's getting all rumbly again. And 
  now I know it's got teeth. And are those literal teeth, 'cause I don't know 
  if I can handle it. And what if I can handle it? Does that mean I have to be 
  a bigger, badder badass than the source of all badness? And what if I give up 
  all this control stuff and I go all veiny and homicidal again? And what if—</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  They won't take you back?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Uh-huh. </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Willow, we could spend another two years here training and practicing and learning 
  to hone your powers and still there'd be no way of knowing for sure that the 
  friends you left behind you are still your friends.</p>

    Zoomed in on a Yorkie puppy on a string. It is being walked by its owner, 
    who's holding its leash and a plastic grocery bag. The dog stops walking to 
    smell something on the concrete sidewalk. There's some random rocks and gravel 
    strewn on that part of the sidewalk. The dog growls and makes sounds of displeasure 
    at whatever it smells.</b></p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Rocky, come on, do your business so I can go home. </p>
<p><i>Rocky growls.</i></p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Could've gotten a cat, but no.</p>
<p><i>Rocky growls, then winces and yelps. Nancy turns to look, but a hole has 
    suddenly appeared and Rocky has disappeared into it. She is still holding 
    onto his leash, and as a result she falls to the ground and is pulled along 
    the sidewalk toward the hole as the leash is pulled further into it. When 
    her head is almost to the tiny hole where the dog disappeared, a large piece 
    of the sidewalk comes up in her face, broken and pushed up from underground 
    by something unseen. Then a monster rises from the ground in front of her. 
    She gets up and runs away as fast as she can, screaming, but bumps into Xander 
    who is out for an evening stroll.</i></p>

  And whatever it was, it was big and strong. Stronger than.... I mean, I don't 
  know how it's possible. You hear thing in this town, living here in Sunnydale, 
  but nobody actually believes them. You know, you'd have to be crazy, and... 
  You guys think that I'm crazy, don't you?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  We've seen things, too, Nancy.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  No, that's OK. Thanks.</p>

<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Good thinking, except... this is the gang.</p>

<p><i>Buffy looks shocked to see Spike here in her house, in front of her friends.

<p><b>SPIKE<br/>
</b>Buffy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Spike. </p>
<p><i>Buffy gets up, walks across the room away from Spike, and looks out the

<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Who is that?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  He's... it's Buffy's...</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Ex.</p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  And I'm thinking it's a little more complicated than just that.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Always is.</p>
<p><i>Buffy has gotten herself together and turns around to face Spike. Her voice 
  is cool and emotionless. </i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You've changed.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I have.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  New clothing. Better hair. Not so much with the crazy. I like it. Now what do 
  you want?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Easy. If you think I like putting myself here, surrounded by people who don't 
  particularly like me, you'd be wrong.</p>
<p><i>Xander stands up and speaks aggressively at Spike.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  If you're uncomfortable, we can make you leave.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I'll be quick. (to Buffy) We need to talk. Want to do that here, or privately?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I'm thinking here, in the company of good friends and pointy weapons.</p>
<p><i>Nancy seems taken aback by all the tension in the room.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You said something about quick?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I did. Before I start, and for the record, the last you saw me, I was a mess—out 
  of my head, admitted. Last week, living in the school basement, well, you saw 
  me.</p>
<p><i>Dawn looks disapprovingly from Spike to Buffy, and walks toward her. Xander 
  is also looking shocked.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  You did?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Guys, just a second, OK. Yes, I saw Spike. I just didn't—</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  What? You just forgot to mention it?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Things were insane in the basement. I saved your life. We can discuss this later.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Sure.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (tenderly) Whatever you want.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Right. 'Cause that seems to be the only time you let us in, Buffy. Whenever 
  you want.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Now, in fairness to Buffy—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (shouting) Shut up, Spike!</p>
<p><i>Nancy again looks uncomfortable at being there for this scene.</i></p>

<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I'm here to help you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Help me what?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I was hoping you'd tell me. You're the slayer. (Buffy crosses her arms over 
  her chest.) Connected to the visions. Long line of worthies, right? I'm just 
  a guy with his ear to the ground, and even I can feel it. Something's coming. 
  I don't know what exactly, but something's brewing. And it's so big, ugly and 
  damned it makes you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces. I mean, if 
  I'm wrong, say so. Lovely. No hard feelings. I'll go out that door and you can 
  lock it behind me with any spell you like. So, am I wrong?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Everything about you is wrong, Spike.</p>
<p><i>Spike takes this as his cue to leave and begins toward the door. He stops 
  when Buffy continues.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  But something is coming. </p>

  You're gonna need some help.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Since when did you become the champion of the people?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I didn't. I'm just a guy who can lend a hand, if you'll let me. Ball's in your

<p><b>BUFFY<br/>
</b>OK, we're gonna split. Two pairs. Whatever this creature is, it's burrowing

  all perky.</p>
<p><i>Buffy opens the weapons chest.</i></p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  (whispering to Xander) Shouldn't we call the police, or something?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  And tell them...?</p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  I'll stop interrupting.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Xander, take Nancy home. Drive, don't walk, and try not to stop 'til you get 
  there.</p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  (to Xander) Is your girlfriend always this... commanding?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Who? Buffy? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. See, uh, I mean, she's a girl, and she's 
  a friend, but she's not my girlfriend.</p>

  Xander... </p>
<p><i>Xander turns to face Dawn. She gestures casually, brushing a finger on the

<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  ...a little drool.</p>
<p><i>He turns back to face Nancy and smiles a nervous laugh. Buffy is holding 
  a large dagger and a flashlight.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Spike and I will check out the scene.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  OK, in the biggest way, I am not loving this plan. (to Buffy) I am not loving 
  Spike. (whispering) He tried to rape you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  And he failed. I know I can take him. Xander, take Nancy home. Spike and I will 
  patrol.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  I'm command central, so everybody check in with me. OK, I'll be here doing my 
  homework, but the other one sounded cooler. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (to Dawn) Be safe. (to Spike) Let's go.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Righty-o, then.</p>
<p><i>Buffy leaves the room. Spike starts to follow, and passes Dawn, who speaks 
  to him with a serious cold glare.</i></p>

  Spike. You sleep, right? You. Vampires. You sleep.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Yeah. What's your point, niblet?</p>

  You're awfully quiet.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Wouldn't know what to say.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Fine with me. I was more half-expecting to get an earful anyway. And when exactly 
  did your sister get unbelievably scary?</p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  What are you doing?</p>

  So, what happened to you?</p>
<p><i>Spike's still all business, talking while looking around for clues.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  When you saw me. Those ghostly types in the school basement got in my head. 
  Made me flat-out, bug-shaggin' crazy. And I'm not exactly braggin' about it, 
  but they were stronger than I was. Made me see things, do things. </p>
<p><i>He stops investigating, and looks her in the eyes. </i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  And how come you never told anyone that you saw me?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I don't know. I guess I was partly hoping you were some kind of mirage.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Sorry to disappoint.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Not your fault.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Hold the torch, would you?</p>
<p><i>He's holding the flashlight toward her, but his hand and fingers are covering 
  the shaft of the light in such a way that she can't take it from him without 
  touching him. She takes it from him, and when they touch, she has agonizing 
  flashbacks of screaming and struggling during the attempted rape attack he made 
  on her back in episode 6x19 "Seeing Red". Buffy is revolted; Spike 
  is concerned.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Look, this... us working together—it's not a way for us to get back together, 
  if that's what you want.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  It's not. Look, I can't blame you for being all skittish.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Skittish? That's not a word I would use for it. You tried to rape me. I don't 
  have the words.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Neither do I. I can't say sorry. Can't use forgive me. All I can say is: Buffy, 
  I've changed.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I believe you.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Well, that's something.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I just don't know what you've changed into. You come back to town. You make 
  with the big surprises. Twice. I don't know what your game is, Spike, but I 
  know there's something you're not telling me.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  You're right. There is. (stands) But we're not best friends anymore, so too 
  bad for me. I'm not sharing. We've been through things. The end of the world 
  and back. I can be useful 'cause, honestly, I've got nothing better to do. Make 
  use of me if you want. (gesturing to the sidewalk)And there's nothing here. 
  Just a bit of slime. Mounds of displaced dirt and such. Whatever our beastie 
  is, he's gone. </p>

    and bursting up from the ground behind them as they flee. Finally, they go

    bursts forth from the floor in front of the stairs. It's a long, pink, cylindrical, 
    and slightly phallic-shaped creature with four jaws full of sharp, pointy 
    teeth. It's roaring and screeching and its jaws are snapping as it lunges 
    for Xander and Nancy. They wait it out together, and finally, it retreats

<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Dumb question. Are you injured? Are you hurt?</p>

<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Two attacks in the same night. I'm starting to think it's not coincidence.</p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Oh, sure. Why not? A monster trying to kill me. It's just the thing that was 
  missing to make my life absolutely perfect. Uhh! Ronnie would love this. Boy!</p>

  Right. Who's Ronnie?</p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Oh, um, only my psycho ex-boyfriend that I've been trying to get rid of for 
  the past few weeks. I almost prefer the monster. Ronnie was, um... trouble.</p>

  Uh-huh. And I'm just curious. Was this Ronnie guy a borrowing money kind of 
  trouble or was he a raising demon trouble kind of guy?</p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Ronnie? He couldn't. He just... "he was an abusive bastard" is the 
  catchy headline. And he'd just show up, even after... you know the feeling that 
  you get when your ex is constantly ruining every part of your life, and it just 
  doesn't stop?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Yes.</p>

<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Is there anyone here that hasn't slept together?</p>
<p><i>Xander and Spike exchange a glance and then look away from each other too 
    quickly. Spike rolls his eyes.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Look, at least we're all bipeds, which is more than I can say for Ronnie, the 
  worm boy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  OK, guys, can we focus here for just a second? Anya, this is Ronnie. OK? He 
  wasn't a worm. (gestures three inches with her thumb and forefinger) Worms are 
  like this big. (gesturing with her hands apart) This thing was like —</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Sluggoth demon. Am I right?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (sighs, rolls eyes) Maybe.</p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Wait, I didn't wish for that. I mean, I don't even know what this whatchamacallit 
  demon thing is.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Sluggoth demon. It's a very large, very nasty, natural predator who died around 
  the crusades.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Same phylum. It's not cheating, I just embellished.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Well, you can un-embellish now.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Bite me, Harris. I have rules to work with. Vengeance demon codes of conduct. 
  But you'll never understand 'cause you're all still so... human.</p>
<p><i>Spike steps up to Anya and gets in her face.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I'm not. Demon, just like yourself, Anya. Now, you're gonna turn the spell around 
  like a good little vengeance demon or I—- what?</p>
<p><i>Anya stares into Spike's eyes with a look of astonishment. </i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Oh, my God!</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  What are you staring at?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Oh, my God!</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Right. Let's go.</p>
<p><i>Spike tries to walk away, but Anya grabs hold of his forearm.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  How did you do it?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Spike, what is she talking about?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I can see you.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Nothing. Let's go. Got some worm hunting to do.</p>
<p><i>Spike tries again to leave, but Anya is being insistent.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  How did you do it?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Shut up. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  You shouldn't be allowed to. </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Shut your mouth!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I mean, how did you get it?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I said you shut up!</p>
<p><i>Spike punches Anya in the face with his free arm. She falls to the floor. 
    Nancy leaves. Anya kicks Spike across the room. He lands on the pool table. 
    When she gets back up again, she is in demon face. Spike is not.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I am so gonna kick your ass.</p>
<p><i>Spike gets up off the pool table, fully ready to engage Anya in a fight.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Right, bitch. Round and round we—</p>
<p><i>But Buffy cuts him off by grabbing his arm and turning him to face her. 
    He is in demon face now.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You haven't changed, Spike.</p>
<p><i>Buffy punches him in the face. He punches back. They continue to fight. 
    Buffy is angry, and Spike is being an ass, goading her. He's not fighting 
    back anymore.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Working out some personal issues, are we? (Buffy punches and kicks him). Hey, 
  I guess this would be first contact since, uh, you know when. Ooh, up for another 
  round up on the balcony, then? (She hits him again, and he lands on the floor; 
  he laughs) Right you are, luv. I haven't changed. Not a lick. (He's in her face 
  now.) And watching your face trying to figure me out was absolutely delicious.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Buffy!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Not now, Xander.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Nancy. She's gone. And out there all alone, she's worm bait. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I'll go find her. Stay with Anya. Get her to reverse that spell.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Hey, is that it? A little touchy-feely, and then you're off to the bat poles?</p>
<p><i>Buffy leaves the Bronze.</i> </p>

<p><b>39     EXT.      CITY STREET - NIGHT<br/>
    Nancy is walking home from the Bronze alone on a deserted street. </b></p>
<p><b>NANCY<br/>
</b>Freaks. Why do I always surround myself with freaks?</p>
<p><i>She hears a rumbling from behind her. The worm demon has found her and is 
    closing in. The street behind her is rupturing from underneath, the asphalt 
    is crumbling. It's getting closer now. </i></p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Oh, God. Oh, God.</p>
<p><i>She tries to get into a building, but it's locked. </i></p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Help! Somebody help me!</p>
<p><i>She climbs the fire escape ladder, she looks down, and the rumbling stops. 
    She's relieved and tries to catch her breath. Then the building starts to 
    shake, and the ladder starts to fall off the brick building it's attached 
    to. Nancy screams. </i></p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  Oh, help me! Help me!</p>

</b>What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Reverse the spell.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  It's not that easy, Xander.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  You can do it.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Yeah, sure, the spell part. What about me? I'm in enough trouble as it is. 
    Halfrek's all over my case. D'Hoffrin is not pleased with my work. You don't 
    want to see him angry. Trust me.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Nice friends you got.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Nice friends I had. Chums. Coworkers. Bridesmaids. Oh, I had the whole package 
  until something fell apart. What could that be, Xander?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  You saying this was my fault?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  All I'm saying is none of this happened until you dumped me at the altar.</p>

    Nancy is still trying to climb the ladder. The worm demon makes another bang 
    against the building's foundation, and Nancy falls off. Buffy swings in from 
    the rooftops on a rope, catches Nancy, and lets go when they are over a cushioned 
    place to land (flattened cardboard boxes). They are on the ground now. They 
    walk around to assess the situation, but the worm demon comes up out of the 
    ground next to Buffy. She's about to attack it when Spike lands behind her 
    and rips a pipe off the wall.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE<br/>
</b>You've had your turn, luv. Leave the real violence to the demons, yeah?</p>
<p><i>He rears back with the pipe in hand and beats the worm demon with it.</i>
</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  That's right. Big bad's back, and looking for a little death!</p>
<p><i>Then he steps back dramatically, holding the pipe like a deadly spear 
    and plunges it into the worm demon right as it turns back into the naked, 
    vulnerable human, Ronnie. Ronnie and Spike scream. Spike clutches his head, 
    and then has a look of horror on his face realizing what he has inadvertently 
    done.</i></p>

<p><b>RONNIE</b><br/>
  Ow!</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (sincerely) I'm sorry.</p>
<p><i>Spike cocks his head and removes the spear from Ronnie. Buffy runs to Ronnie's 
    aid with a blanket. Spike holds the spear with both hands and looks at it, 
    talking to himself.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Right. Wrong. All wrong. Wrong maneuver. Not hardly helpful.</p>
<p><i>Nancy walks over to Ronnie.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  God, please help me. (screaming, to Buffy) Help me!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You're not the one who needs help. He's going into shock. </p>
<p><i>Buffy dials 9-1-1 while Spike mumbles under his breath.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  No. No. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. 
  (more inaudible rambling) ...inside me all the way.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (into phone) Yeah, I need an ambulance. Someone's been stabbed. (pause) Oh, 
  God, uh, corner of Third and Fairview. (to Ronnie) OK, help is coming. Try not 
  to move.</p>
<p><i>Spike taps his chest.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Deep, deep, deep inside me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Look, Spike, whatever you're doing—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (addressing someone who's not there) Get away. Get. Uhh—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Do it somewhere else. I am through with this.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Oh, oh, lucky girl. Call it quits. Now, there's an option. If only it were so 
  easy. If only— If only— If only— (addressing someone who's not there) What 
  the hell are you screaming about? I can hear you. No need to (screams) SHOUT!</p>
<p><i>While saying shout, Spike's voice and face change into a scream of agony; 
    he's bends over in pain. He stands up and laughs, still holding the pipe.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I get it. The joke's on me. Lots of laughs. (twirling the pipe slowly, like 
  a baton) Yeah. Hey, bring the wife and kiddies. Come see the show 'cause it's 
  going to be a circus. This... (walks toward Buffy and kneels in front of her) 
  just the beginning, luv. A warm-up act. The real headliner's coming, and when 
  that band hits the stage, all of this... (stands up and gestures to the buildings 
  around them) all this... will come tumbling in death and screaming, horror and 
  bloodshed. (points to Ronnie) From beneath you, it devours. From beneath... 
  (starts to cry, and looks away) Poor Rocky. </p>
<p><i>Spike is all choked up. At first, he's crying but then starts to gag. He 
    runs away down the alley, leaving Buffy there with Ronnie and Nancy. Xander 
    comes running to them, and Anya is following, sauntering slowly.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Buffy!</p>
<p><b>NANCY</b><br/>
  You. You did this. What are you?</p>

    a pillow that she puts under Ronnie's head.</i></p>

  She's not calling me. </p>
<p><i>Buffy stands and hands Xander her cell phone.</i> </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  OK. Help is on the way. Look after him.</p>

<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  You did the right thing here.</p>

    Buffy is walking through a moonlit cemetery alone, looking around for Spike. 
    She sees the chapel, with lanterns lighting the front door. She heads toward 
    it.</b></p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>44     INT.      CHAPEL AT CEMETERY - NIGHT<br/>
    An oval painting on the wall is lit with moonlight streaming into the small 
    chapel. It appears to be a medieval painting of Mary holding baby Jesus and 
    standing in front of a fringed white drape. Zoom down to Buffy walking through 
    the front door. The chapel is set up with a dozen wooden pews arranged on 
    either side of a central aisle. There is a large, simple, gothic crucifix 
    at the front of the chapel that can be seen by looking directly down the central 
    aisle. Buffy looks around. There are three stained glass arched windows on 
    each sidewall of the chapel. She walks forward and jumps when Spike speaks 
    to her from the shadows behind her.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Hello.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  What the hell are you—?</p>
<p><i>Spike is bare-chested, holding his shirt out to her.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  It didn't work. Costume. Didn't help. Couldn't hide.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No more mind games, Spike.</p>
<p><i>Spike is looking down at the ground even though he is standing right in 
    front of her.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  No more mind games. No more mind. </p>
<p><i>Buffy reaches for his chest, where the scars seen in episode 7x01 "Lessons" 
    are healing.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Tell me what happened to you.</p>
<p><i>Spike flinches, recoils violently, and looks her into her eyes.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Hey, hey, hey! No touching. Am I flesh? Am I flesh to you? Feed on flesh. My 
  flesh. Nothing else. Not a spark. (nods) Oh, fine. Flesh then. Solid through. 
  (starts unzipping his pants) Get it hard; service the girl. </p>
<p><i>Buffy is disgusted and smacks his hands away from his pants.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Stop it!</p>
<p><i>Spike reflexively reaches up and grabs her by the throat. Buffy grabs his 
    shoulder and throws him across the room. Spike lands on top of some pews, 
    breaking them into pieces. He sits up a little, propped on his elbows behind 
    him.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Right. Girl doesn't want to be serviced. Because there's no spark. Ain't we 
  in a soddin' engine?</p>
<p><i>Spike's looking around the room. Buffy walks over to him.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Spike, have you completely lost your mind?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (lucidly) Well, yes. Where've you been all night?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You thought you would just come back here and... be with me?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  First time for everything.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  This is all you get. I'm listening. Tell me what happened.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I tried to find it, of course.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Find what?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  The spark. The missing... the piece that fit. That would make me fit. Because 
  you didn't want... (starts to cry) God, I can't... Not with you looking. </p>
<p><i>Spike stands and walks away to a nearby window. He stands there, mostly 
    in shadow, his body directed away from her. He looks back over his shoulder 
    at her.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I dreamed of killing you.</p>
<p><i>Keeping an eye on him, Buffy bends down to pick up a large splinter from 
    the broken pews at her feet to use as a stake, if necessary. Spike starts 
    pacing.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I think they were dreams. So weak. Did you make me weak, thinking of you, holding 
  myself, and spilling useless buckets of salt over your... ending? Angel—he 
  should've warned me. He makes a good show of forgetting, but it's here, in me, 
  all the time. (walks around toward her from behind) The spark. I wanted to give 
  you what you deserve, and I got it. They put the spark in me and now all it 
  does is burn. </p>
<p><i>Buffy's face shows shock, disbelief and, finally, comprehension.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Your soul.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (laughs) Bit worse for lack of use.</p>
<p><i>Buffy turns to face him.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You got your soul back. How?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  It's what you wanted, right? (looking at the ceiling) It's what you wanted, 
  right? (presses his fingers to his temples, looks down, and walks toward the 
  altar). And—and now everybody's in here, talking. Everything I did...everyone 
  I— and him... and it... the other, the thing beneath—beneath you. It's here 
  too. Everybody. They all just tell me go... go... (looks back over his shoulder 
  to Buffy) to hell.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Why? Why would you do that—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Buffy, shame on you. Why does a man do what he mustn't? For her. To be hers. 
  To be the kind of man who would nev— (looks away) to be a kind of man. </p>
<p><i>Spike walks toward the 6-foot-tall crucifix altarpiece at the front of the 
    chapel. Sounds like he's quoting something.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  She shall look on him with forgiveness, and everybody will forgive and love. 
  He will be loved. </p>
<p><i>Spike's standing only a foot away from the crucifix, staring at it.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  So everything's OK, right? (sighs) </p>
<p><i>Spike embraces the crucifix, resting one arm over each side of the cross 
    bar, and resting his head in the corner of the vertex. His body is sizzling 
    and smoke is rising from where it touches the cross.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Can—can we rest now? Buffy...can we rest?</p>
<p><i>A close-up of Buffy's face shows that she is crying now. From where she 
    stands, Spike's exhausted body hanging limply on the cross resembles Jesus 
    (except the view is of Spike's back). </i></p>
