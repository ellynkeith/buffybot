    Warren standing behind Andrew. Jonathan's eyes widen as Andrew takes his left 
    hand and stabs him in the belly with a dagger. Jonathan looks at Andrew and 
    Warren, hurt. Jonathan collapses onto the metal object that they unearthed.

    files on his desk, then looks around the room. Buffy notices a wall cabinet, 
    and walks up to it. Before she can open it, Principal Wood walks into the

    STUDY - NIGHT<br/>
    Classical violin music plays as the camera pans across the room. Show a wall 
    full of shelves stuffed with leather-bound books, a desk full of trinkets 
    of interest, such as skulls, quills, chemical bottles, an hourglass, and a 
    comic book laid open on a pedestal. A Star Wars poster hangs on the wall, 
    with action figures displayed on a shelf in front of it. There's a fire in 
    the fireplace beneath an elaborate mantelpiece, over which hangs an anime 
    poster and tribal masks. Pan over to Andrew who's sitting in a leather wing 
    chair wearing a silk smoking jacket, holding a pipe in his right hand and 
    an open book in his left. He's reading the book.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (looks up from his reading, chuckles) Oh, hello, there, gentle viewers. (closes 
    his book) You caught me catching up on an old favorite. (pats the book) It's 
    wonderful to get lost in a story, isn't it? (puts his hand to his chin) Adventure 
    and heroics and discovery—don't they just take you away? (puffs on the 
    pipe, but it makes him cough, so he sets it down in the crystal tray beside 
    his chair) Come with me now, if you will, gentle viewers. Join me on a new 
    voyage of the mind. A little tale I like to call: Buffy, Slayer of the Vampyrs.

      It was cold last night, and the wind was crew-ell, but the Slayer had a 
      job to do. </i></p>
<p><i>A vampire attacks her from behind, but she flips onto a tombstone and 
      shoots him with a stake from her crossbow. He explodes into dust, but another 
      vampire goes for her. </i></p>
<p><i><b>ANDREW (V.O.)</b><br/>
      Unfortunately, vampires have a job to do, too. </i></p>
<p><i>She backflips off of the tombstone and lands on the ground, ready to 
      fight him in hand-to-hand combat. He pushes her against a tomb. </i></p>

<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Ouch! My goodness! Things look bad for the Slayer, don't they? She didn't 
    see that second vampire, concealed by cover of darkness, ready— (there's 
    a knock at the door; Andrew ignores it) ready to attack and make her his own 
    vampirical spawn. </p>

    (opens the door) For God's sakes, Andrew. You've been in here for 30 minutes. 
    What are you doing?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Entertaining and educating. </p>

<p><b>16      EXT.      CEMETERY 
    - NIGHT<br/>
    Resume the fight between Buffy and the vampire. The vampire charges her, but 
    she has a stake ready. Andrew was filming them from behind a nearby grave.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (runs up to Buffy, video camera in hand) That was great. I completely got 
    you dusting that guy on film. Hey, why do vampires show up on video?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (shown through the camcorder) I told you I didn't want you doing that. It's 
    distracting. (walks away)</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (still taping, he walks beside her) OK, I'll cut the footage together and 
    do the intro tomorrow. "She was a woman in danger, or was she?"</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Are you still filming me? Stop!</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    But it's a valuable record. An important document for the ages. "A Slayer 
    in action."</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (leans toward Andrew) "A nerd in pain." Would they like that? 'Cause 
    we could do that. (walks away)</p>

    Anya is dragging Andrew out of the bathroom by his collar. Meanwhile, there's 
    at least three girls lined up outside the bathroom door.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    But the story needs to be told.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (lets go of him) Birds need to fly, and girls need to use the toilet, and 
    why were you video taping yourself, anyway? Sounds like kinky business to 
    me.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    The world's gonna want to know about Buffy. It's a story of ultimate triumph 
    tainted with the bitterness for what's been lost in the struggle. It's a legacy 
    for future generations.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    If there are any. Buffy seems to think that this apocalypse is going to actually 
    be, you know, apocalyptic. I think your—your story seems pretty pointless.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Oh, (looks away) I was gonna interview you later today, (stands close to Anya, 
    looking in her eyes) 'cause, you know, your whole perspective on the whole 
    thing. Give it editorial balance and, uh, (cocks his head to the side, looks 
    at her) glamour...</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (looks pensive, nods) Oh, well balance is important. People don't always take 
    that into account. I could bring that to you. Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>18      INT.      BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Viewed in "Play" mode on the camcorder, Andrew's in the basement 
    standing in front of the "Big Board" holding the remote control 
    for the video camera. It's propped up on the washer and dryer, and has been 
    erased and redrawn since last episode. Now, it's got a flaming red face in 
    the upper right quadrant, a depiction of a group of 5 harbingers in the lower 
    right quadrant, a drawing of a building in the upper left quadrant, and a 
    fiery mess with a black hole and a brown monster are in the lower left. Andrew 
    comes off as a novice presenter, fidgeting and stuttering frequently.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Let's explore the world of our story, shall we? This—uh, Buffy lives 
    in Sunnydale, California. (moves to the side so the whole board can be seen, 
    uses the remote to zoom the camera in as he points to the building with a 
    marker) Um, this is the local high school. </p>
<p><i>The video cuts to a zoomed-in shot of the lower left quadrant of the board. 
    It's labeled "HELLMOUTH" and has a depiction of the seal (in black) 
    and the brown monster drawn coming from the seal is labeled "UBERVAMP." 
    </i></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    There's a hellmouth—hellmouth—underneath the high school. See, weird 
    things happen on the hellmouth (zoom out) that attracts all sorts of, uh, 
    bad people and demons and vampires. And now there's this thing in the basement 
    of the high school called the-the seal of Danzal—Danzalthar, and it's 
    sort of a door to the hellmouth. (stands in front of the board, nervously) 
    Uh, due to some circumstances it got opened up... a little bit... recently...uh, 
    and this, uh, nasty, nasty vampire thing came out of it. It was, uh, it was 
    just awful, awful. This whole thing— (gestures in a circle with the marker) 
    whole thing—is being orchestrated by something called "The First". 
    It's made up of all the evil in the whole world. Oh, there's also these guys. 
    (points to the harbingers) They work for the First. We don't know much about 
    them except that they're very ugly and they're very mobile for blind people. 
    Is that all clear?</p>

    Andrew, with camcorder in hand, is video taping activity in the kitchen. The 
    room is full of people. </b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    It's morning in Sunnydale—</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (looking in the fridge) Who the hell's got the low-fat milk?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    It's morning in Sunnydale, and the women of command central take the time 
    to fortify themselves for the day ahead. (Kennedy and Willow pours themselves 
    each a bowl of cereal)</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (eating cereal from the box, scowls at Andrew) Hey!</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Women and Xander. (puts the camera down for a moment) Hey, I'm gonna do your 
    special intro later. "The man who is the heart of the slayer machine."</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (smiles) Yeah? The heart? (blushes) </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (recording again, walks around the room) Things are tense in command central 
    this morning. Buffy is clearly concerned with some unknown danger, and the 
    air is filled with foreboding.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (drying dishes) Oh, um, we're out of Raisin Bran. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    I'll put it on the list.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    That's probably not the unknown danger.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (walks into the kitchen) Look at this place. Damn girls' dorm is what it is. 
    (lights up a cigarette)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    That's nice. Second-hand stinkiness.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Full house. I think it's a good time to do some introductions, don't you, 
    gentle viewers?</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    (standing in front of Andrew, she waves and talks into the camera) I'm Amanda, 
    and I grew up right here—</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (looks up from the camera) Not you, sweetheart. (mouths "sorry" 
    to Amanda) Let's start from the top. </p>
<p><i>Andrew narrates while the video shown is in a super-produced ultra-glamorous 
    style.</i></p>
<p><b>ANDREW (V.O.)</b><br/>
    You've already met Buffy. (Buffy gracefully pours herself a bowl of cereal, 
    and shakes her hair sexily in the breeze that comes from nowhere, and looks 
    directly into the camera) She's beautiful, with a lion's heart and— (Buffy 
    winks) and the face of an Angel. She's never afraid 'cause she knows her side 
    will always win. (a shirtless Spike enters view, walking up to Buffy; they 
    look as if they will kiss, but don't; instead, he touches her waist, and Buffy 
    touches his arms as they nearly embrace) Buffy and Spike have some kind of 
    history—you can feel the heat between them. Although, technically, as 
    a vampire, he's room temperature. (flits sexily into view, crossing in front 
    of Spike and Buffy, twirling and eating from a bunch of grapes, then smiling 
    into the camera) Anya, a feisty waif with a firey temper and a vulnerable 
    heart that she hides, even from herself. (camera pans over to a blonde girl 
    eating from a bowl of cereal) This lovely girl—I don't remember her name—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (to Xander) Oh, for God's sake. Is he doing that again? Can't we make him 
    stop?</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    I don't know, if we save the world, it will be kind of nice to have a record 
    of it. (Buffy rolls her eyes) </p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    If we don't save the world, then... nothing matters.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (pauses in her breakfast, spoon still in hand) That's catchy, Amanda. Let's 
    make that our slogan.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Yeah, it is kinda strange, how you keep saving the world, and there's not 
    any proof.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Yeah, you know, for future generations.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    And it does help the girls with training—you know, viewing the tapes.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Come on. No one else thinks this is idiotic?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Or is it important? I mean, Buff, I don't get why this is bothering you so 
    much.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Because it's a waste of time. Come on, someone has to agree with me. Spike?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Long as you're not pointing that thing at me, seems like a fine way to keep 
    the boy busy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    This isn't about keeping busy. This is about war. I'm sorry to jump all over 
    you guys, but... I have to tell you what's really going on. There's something 
    new. (Andrew walks around behind Buffy) Amanda, Dawn—you're gonna stay 
    home from school today. We can survive what's coming, but not like this. (Andrew 
    goes into the dining room, but Buffy continues talking) I had a vision of 
    what's to come—a horrible vision. Hundreds upon hundreds of....</p>

<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Honestly, gentle viewers, these motivating speeches of hers tend to get a 
    little long. I'll take you back in there in—in a little while, but in 
    the in-between time, I thought you might want to know a little about me, your 
    humble host. You see, I am a man with a burden. A man with a dark past. You

    have been in kind of a bad place lately, but things are looking up. You see, 
    Kennedy pursued the reluctant Willow and won her heart, only to find herself

    (frightened) Sorry. Sorry.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Shut up. You always do this. You make everything into a story so no one's 
    responsible for anything because they're just following a script.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Please don't kill me. Warren said Jonathan would be OK. I trusted him, and 
    I lost my friend.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (angrily) You didn't lose him. You murdered him.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (softly, sincerely) I know, but you don't need to kill me. You said we could 
    all get through this.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I made it up. I'm making it all up. What kind of hero does that make me?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (shakes his head) No, you're doing great. Really. Kudos.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Yeah? Well, I don't like having to give a bunch of speeches about how we're 
    all gonna live, because we won't. This isn't some story where good triumphs 
    because good triumphs. Good people are going to die! Girls. Maybe me. Probably 
    you. Probably right now.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (shakes his head, frightened) Don't! Please! Don't, please!</p>
<p><i>Buffy pushes him toward the seal; he leans over it, but she's holding 
    the back of his jacket so he doesn't fall. She's pointing the knife at him. 
    </i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    When your blood pours out, it might save the world. What do you think about 
    that? Does it buy it all back? Are you redeemed?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (crying) No.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Why not?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (sobbing, his face is tear-streaked) Because I killed him. Because I listened 
    to Warren, and I pretended I thought it was him, but I knew—I knew it 
    wasn't. And I killed Jonathan. And now you're gonna kill me. And I'm scared, 
    and I'm going to die. And this—this is what Jonathan felt. </p>
<p><i>As Andrew's tears flow, a tear droplet falls from his face onto the seal 
    below. It immediately stops glowing. Buffy lets Andrew go. He falls to the 
    ground and puts the knife down.</i></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    It stopped.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Didn't want blood. It wanted tears.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (stands) Thanks.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Sorry, I had to—</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    You—you weren't really going to stab me, were you?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I wasn't going to stab you.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    What if the tears didn't work?</p>
<p><i>Buffy walks out of the room. Andrew grabs his camcorder and follows her.</i></p>

    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
    Robin and Spike are fighting students, but suddenly the students stop fighting 
    back. Instead, they just walk away.</b></p>
<p><b>ROBIN WOOD</b><br/>
    She got it done.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Always has. </p>

    himself as before.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Here's the thing. I killed my best friend. There's a big fight coming, and 
    I don't know what's going to happen. I don't even think I'm going to live 
    through it. (looks down) That's, uh, probably the way it should be. I guess 
    I'm— (looks at the camera, sighs, points the remote control, presses 
    a button, and turns it off)</p>
