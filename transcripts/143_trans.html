    Buffy walks down the steps into the wine cellar. With one powerful punch,

    at Caleb, but he grabs her sword, then her face. Caleb snaps the potential's 
    neck and drops her to the ground. Molly sees Caleb kill the potential. Caleb 
    grabs Xander and turns him around so he's facing Caleb. Caleb plunges his 
    thumb into Xander's left eye, gouging it out. Xander screams in agony. Xander, 
    bleeding from his eye, stumbles back, falling to the ground in front of wine

    Buffy walks up to the rock where the Bringers were working before, and now 
    we see what they were after. Stuck inside the rock is a shiny weapon of some 
    sort—it's got a wide, rounded blade on one end, and a point on the end 
    of the shaft. Buffy's eyes widen as she stares at it in awe. She smiles. </b></p>

<p><b>16     INT.     TUNNEL 
    - DAY<br/>
    The girls follow Faith down a long, dark hallway. Faith walks over a plank 
    laid across a small waterway and sees a box that's padlocked shut. Faith kicks 
    at the padlock, busting it. She bends down to open the box and finds a timer/detonator 
    reading "00.04" that is wired to a box full of bricks labeled "C4 
    High Explosive." Her eyes widen as it counts down in seconds, beeping 
    as the numbers change:<br/>
<i>00.03 (beep)<br/>
    (beep)<br/>
    (beep)</i></b></p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (yelling to the others, and ducking away) Get down!</p>

    Buffy stares at the shiny weapon stuck in the rock and walks up to it slowly. 
    Caleb opens the hatch and walks down the stairs into the room. Buffy turns 
    to look at him. </b></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    So...you found it. Not impressed. 'Cause the question now, girly girl, is 
    can you pry it from solid rock before I come over there—</p>
<p><i>Buffy grabs the handle and pulls the weapon out of the stone one-handed 
    with ease. She looks it over. </i></p>

    Resume. Caleb is confronting Buffy in the cellar just as she has pulled the 
    weapon out of the stone.</b></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Now, before you go hurting yourself with that thing, why don't you do yourself 
    a courtesy and hand it over now?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    (cocks her head to the side) Yeah? You want it? (hoists the weapon up casually)</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    (smiles nervously) You don't even know what you got there. (steps back)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I know you're backing away.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>

    You think wielding some 2-sided doo-dad's gonna make a difference?</p>
<p><i>Buffy/First shows up behind Caleb frowning with her arms crossed.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    Let her go, Caleb. (he hesitates) I said let her go.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    If I let her go, she slices me open with that thing.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    No, she doesn't. She hasn't got time. She has friends. (Buffy looks at her 
    worriedly) And her friends are in trouble. Faith go boom.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    I'm not letting her out of here with that thing.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    Sure you are. Then you'll come back for it later...when she's got her back 
    turned.</p>

    The air is hazy with dust and debris from the explosion. Girls start moving 
    amid the rubble, crawling around. Amanda grabs a flashlight as she gets to 
    her feet.</b></p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>

    (calling around) Hey! Hey, Faith! Anybody! Is anybody here?!</p>
<p><b>CARIDAD</b><br/>
    (coughs) Me! (stands)</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    (calling out) Is anybody else alive?</p>
<p><b>CARIDAD</b><br/>

    Hello? Anyone?</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    I'm—(coughs, then weakly) I'm here!</p>
<p><i>Amanda and Caridad go to Vi, who's crouched in a corner. They help her 
    to her feet.</i></p>
<p><b>CARIDAD</b><br/>
    Who else we got?</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    Don't know. </p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    You OK? (they help Vi walk)</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    I think my arm is broken. (sees girls lying under rubble, not moving; Vi stares, 
    shocked) I guess I'm lucky.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (stands) Where's Faith?</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    I don't know.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Find her.</p>
<p><b>CARIDAD</b><br/>
    Maybe we should get the hell out of this place. They could—</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (emphatically) Find her!</p>
<p><i>Amanda and a couple other girls pull Faith's unconscious body out of the 
    water. </i></p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>

    (turning away at the sight) Oh, God!</p>

    Is she alive?</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>

<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

    We gotta get her out of here.</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    Which way is out?</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    There's other girls. There's more than Faith. We don't even know how many 
    of us are still— (the girls hear a distant growl; everyone stops to look) 
    alive.</p>
<p><b>CARIDAD</b><br/>
    What was that?</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    It could've been grinding metal. It could've been—</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    No, it was one of them.</p>
<p><b>CARIDAD</b><br/>
    That's not possible.</p>

    How'd it get in here? </p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>

<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

<p><i>The girls run out of the room where the explosion happened and try to 
    escape down the tunnels they came in. </i></p>

    Oh, no! It's blocked!</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>

    (crying) Oh, my God!</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    I told you this wasn't the way!</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Cut the chatter! Up and over! Wounded first! Let's go!</p>
<p><i>The girls climb over the debris blocking the tunnel. With all the wounded 
    girls, it's taking too long. Finally, when the last girl, Vi, comes over the 
    pile, a Turok-Han reaches for her. The girls scream and instinctively back 
    away as they watch it climb over the pile and move toward them.</i></p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Group together. Form a circle. Nobody panic. It's all of us, one of him. We 
    can take one of these things.</p>
<p><i>As the girls stare at the Turok-Han coming over the pile of debris, another 
    Turok-Han jumps down the steps beside them. </i></p>

<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    It was pretty amazing. A whole grocery store just abandoned. Food lying around 
    everywhere. Uh, the produce was on its way to funky town, but—</p>

<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (holding her fists up in front of her) Remember the training. Everybody, get 
    ready! (a Turok-Han sneaks up behind her and grabs her, knocking her down;

    There's another one.</p>

<p><i>Kennedy runs to the weapons, but the Turok-Han have already begun ripping 
    apart the girl they grabbed. One looks at Kennedy, snarling, his face covered 
    in the girl's blood. It charges toward Kennedy who swings the weapon at the 
    monster, but to no avail. The Turok-Han easily disarms her, grabs her by the 
    neck, and lifts her off the ground choking her.. </i></p>
<p><i>A loud crash echoes through the room as something falls from the ceiling, 
    allowing light to enter the room from above. Buffy jumps down through the 
    hole into the room carrying the weapon she got from the vineyard earlier. 
    The Turok-Han drops Kennedy and stalks toward Buffy. Buffy swings the weapon 
    at the Turok-Han as it approaches her, and she uses the pointy end to stake 
    first one Turok-Han, then the other. The third Turok-Han approaches her and 
    knocks her down, but Buffy tumbles forward, grabs her weapon, leaps to her 
    feet, and beheads the last Turok-Han, turning it to dust before everyone's 
    eyes. </i></p>

    I think it's maybe some kind of scythe. The only thing I know for sure is 
    it made Caleb back off in a hurry.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (giggles) So it's true. Scythe matters. (pushes Giles playfully) </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    And, ignoring that, I'd just like to point out this is really quite ingenious. 
    (plays with the weapon)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Kills strong bodies 3 ways.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    And you say you sense something when you hold it?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Not much, but it's strong. And I knew it belonged to me. I just knew it.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (inspecting the weapon) In addition to being ancient, it's clearly mystical.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Yeah, I figured that one out when I King Arthured it out of the stone.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    So maybe it's like some kind of traditional slayer weapon.</p>

    Right. Um... (sits on the bed) any chance that it might be something other 
    than a tool for killing things?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    The First's guys clearly wanted it out of that stone. It's not just a tool. 
    It's important. We need to find out whatever we can. Who made it, when, why? 
    Does it have a name? (shrugs) I don't know, a credit report? Just find out

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Of course I'm not putting you out to pasture. (shakes her head) What does 
    that even mean?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Well, you know, it's like, uh... when a cow gets old and loses an eye, or 
    its ability to be milked, the farmer takes it and puts it in a different pasture 
    so it won't have to... fight...with the priests. (chuckles) Look, I don't

    OK, before the vineyard was just, you know, a vineyard, it was a monastery. 
    Could've been put there then. Some creepy monks messing with powers they don't 
    understand.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    No, it's older than that. It's pre-Christian. (scratches his head)</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    OK. Well, I found reference to stories the monks used to tell about something 
    older. Uh, like, some kind of pagan temple.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Native American?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    No. I don't know. Ugh. OK, maybe we're just going about this the wrong way. 
    (her laptop screen shows a site entitled "History of the Axe") Maybe 
    we should research the weapon itself. Like...look. Maybe it's the Axe of Dekeron, 
    said to have been forged in hell itself. Lost since the Children's Crusade, 
    where it was said to have killed— (sits back, makes a face) Oh. Children. 
    I hope that's not it.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

    Well, I have reference to the Sword of Moskva, the, uh...Reaper of the Tigris—how 
    are we supposed to narrow this down? The illustrations are never clear enough. 
    (stands, leans on the window) Oh, damn. We're running out of time. We really 
    haven't got anything useful. (Willow walks to the weapon and picks it up) 
    Do you sense any of the power that Buffy spoke about?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Gotta say no. Must be a slayer thing.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (walks over to Willow and sits on the edge of the bed) Tapping into magicks 
    might help with that.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

    Maybe. But, I mean, if Caleb is scared of this thing, it must be pretty dangerous. 
    And tapping into that... (puts the weapon down carefully) </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Willow, you could do it without endangering yourself.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (apprehensive) If I tried something big, I'd change. And then it's all black

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

    I guess so. Ugh. Man, none of these sound right. (scrolls down) I mean, look. 
    Here's one that's just "m" question mark. What the heck is that?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (stands) Let me see. (walks to look at the screen) It's not a question mark. 
    It's the international phonetics alphabet symbol for glottal stop.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    A whoey?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    It's sort of a gulping noise. I'm...remembering something here. Um... Ah. 
    Hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs stand for sets of consonants, as you know.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (paces) "M" plus glottal stop is represented by a picture that's 
    commonly thought to symbolize a sickle or a scythe. It's in thousands of carvings. 
    In Egypt, throughout the ancient world. </p>

    Carvings like you'd have on a pagan temple?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I'm not shirty. And what is shirty? That's not even a word.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    All right. All right. Big secret mission. It's fine.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    It's not a secret. Well, I mean, it is, but that's the point of the mission. 
    Find out the secret. This thing was forged by— I don't even know. I mean, 
    something about... a tomb on unconsecrated ground. That's what I have to do. 
    I need to find out what this is and why I have it.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    And that's the thing the preacher man was so anxious to keep out of your mitts?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    That it is.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Well, maybe I'll swing by the vineyard when you go, make sure he's sitting 
    tight.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Great.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    OK. (turns to leave)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (walks after him) You're a dope.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I'm a what?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You're a dope. And a bonehead. And you're shirty.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Have you gone completely carrot-top?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Do you see this? (holds up the scythe) This may actually help me fight my 
    war. This might be the key to everything. And the reason I'm holding it is 
    because of you. Because of the strength that you gave me last night. Look, 
    I am tired of defensiveness and weird, mixed signals. You know, I have Faith 
    for that. Let's just get to the truth here, OK? I don't know how you felt 
    about last night, but I will not—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (breathes in, looks away) Terrified.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Of what?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (lets out a slow sigh) Last night was... (looks up) God, I'm such a jerk. 
    I can't do this.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Spike...</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    It was the best night of my life. If you poke fun at me, you bloody well better 
    use that, 'cause I couldn't bear it. It may not mean that much to you, but—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I just told you it did.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (sighs) Yeah...I hear you say it, but... I've lived for soddin' ever, Buffy. 
    I've done everything. Done things with you I can't spell, but... I've never... 
    been close... to anyone. Least of all, you. 'Til last night. All I did was... 
    (smiles) hold you, watch you sleep. And it was the best night of my life. 
    So, yeah... I'm... terrified.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You don't have to be.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (looks at her) Were you there with me?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (looks straight at him) I was.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    What does that mean?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I don't know. Does it have to mean something?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    No. (looks away) Not right now.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Maybe when...</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    No. (throws up his hand) Let's just leave it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    OK.</p>

    SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT<br/>
    Andrew and Anya walk into the supply room carrying bags over their shoulders.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Ooh. This one has oxygen tanks.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    They'd only be useful if something big was attacking, and then we could shove 
    one down their throat and blow 'em up like Roy Scheider did with that shark 
    in Jaws. (Andrew stares at her) What?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    You are the perfect woman.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    I've often thought so. Wanna rob?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Let's rob. (they walks to the shelves and rifle through things) Oh, cool. 
    Gauze and alcohol... tape and, oh, sutures, if we want to get stitchy with 
    it. Oh, and there's a... box of ointment here. I used one of these on a rash 
    once.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Oh. Show me.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Well, it—it's healed up, but it was red and crusty with these little 
    itchy places. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Show me the box full of ointments, you little freak. And get cotton packing 
    for the big wounds.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    It's gonna be bad, isn't it?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Yeah.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (sighs) So how come you're here? I mean, you could just go. Right?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Yeah. I did once before. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Before what?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Well...there was this other apocalypse... this one time, and... well, I took 
    off. But this time, I don't...I don't know.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (sighs) Well...what's different?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Well...I guess I was...kinda new to bein' around humans before. But now I've... 
    seen a lot more, gotten to know people... seen what they're capable of, and... 
    (shrugs) I guess I just realized...how amazingly screwed-up they all are. 
    I mean really, really screwed-up in a monumental fashion.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Oh. (nods)</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    And they have no purpose that unites them, so they just drift around, blundering 
    through life until they die...which they...they know is coming, yet every 
    single one of them is surprised when it happens to them. They're incapable 
    of thinking about what they want beyond the moment. They kill each other, 
    which is clearly insane. And yet, here's the thing. When it's something that 
    really matters, they fight. I mean, they're lame morons for fighting, but 
    they do. They never... never quit. So I guess I will keep fighting, too.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (sighs) That was kind of beautiful. (Anya nods) You...you love humans.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (indignant) I do not.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Yes, you do. You loooove them </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Stop it! I don't love them! And I'll kill you if you tell anybody.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    I won't tell anybody. Won't get a chance to, anyway.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    I don't know. You might survive.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    No, you might survive. You know how to handle a weapon, and you've been in 
    this world for, like, a thousand years. I'm not so... (sighs) I don't think 
    I'll be OK. I'm cool with it. I think I'd like to...finish out as one of those... 
    lame humans tryin' to do what's right. (smiles)</p>

    TOMB - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy walks down into the tomb. It's lit inside, although dimly, by torches, 
    giving it an orange hue. Buffy looks around cautiously. A woman's voice comes 
    from behind a drape. </b></p>
<p><b>WOMAN (O.S.)</b><br/>
    I'd forgotten. I'd forgotten how young you would be. </p>
<p><i>The woman opens the drape, and Buffy sees a very old woman with long white 
    hair standing before her.</i></p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    Comes from the waiting. Mind plays tricks. I see you've found our weapon.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Who are you?</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    One of many. Well...time was. Now I'm alone in the world.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    So what are you? Some kind of ghost?</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    (chuckles softly, shakes her head) Nope. I'm as real as you are. Just...well... 
    let me put it this way— I look good for my age. I've been waiting. (holds 
    out her hands; Buffy hands over the scythe) You pulled it out of the rock. 
    I was one of those who put it in there.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    What is it?</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    (admires the scythe) A weapon. A scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you 
    who— I'm sorry. What's your name?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Buffy.</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    No, really. (Buffy shrugs) We forged it in secrecy and kept it hidden from 
    the Shadow Men, who—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Yeah. Met those guys. Didn't really care too much for 'em.</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    Ahh, yes. Then you know. And they became the watchers. And the watchers watched 
    the slayers. But we were watching them. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Oh! So you're like... what are you?</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    Guardians. Women who want to help and protect you. We forged this centuries 
    ago, halfway around the world.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Hence, the Luxor Casino theme.</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    Forged there, it was put to use right here...to kill the last pure demon that 
    walked upon the Earth. The rest were already driven under. And then there 
    were men here, and then there were monks. And then there was a town, and now 
    there was you. And the scythe remained hidden.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I don't understand. How is it possible that we didn't know any of this?</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    We hid, too. We had to until now. We're the last surprise.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Does this mean I can win?</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    That is really up to you. This is a powerful weapon. (hands the scythe back 
    to Buffy)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Yeah.</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    But you already have weapons.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Oh.</p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    Use it wisely and perhaps you can beat back the rising dark. One way or another, 
    it can only mean an end is truly near.</p>
<p><i>The woman's head cocks slightly to the side, and a cracking noise can 
    be heard. The woman falls to the ground. Buffy looks up and sees Caleb standing 
    there. </i></p>

    I'm sorry. I didn't catch that last part on account of her neck snapping and

<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Chloroform. Are you still loopy?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Sorry about that. Someone knocked me out with chloroform. (looks around) Xander, 
    where are we going? What's going on? Talk to me.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

    Away. (hands Dawn a letter)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

    Just open it.</p>
<p><i>Dawn opens the letter and starts reading.</i></p>

    Dearest Dawn, don't be angry with Xander. He only did what I told him to do. 
    This isn't the place for either of you. Please know that I love you and that 
    everything I do is for you. I promised once to show you this beautiful world, 
    and I'm going to do everything I can to make that happen—</p>

    Buffy swings the scythe at Caleb, but he grabs it with ease, pushing her away. 
    They fight, exchanging punches and kicks. Caleb is much stronger than before, 
    as shown when he tries to punch Buffy, but she ducks and he instead punches 
    through a stone pillar. </b></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Ha ha ha ha! You're not slipping out of this fight, girl. Can't you see? You 
    can't stop me. I can just keep going back for more. It's like being reborn.</p>
<p><i>Buffy swings the scythe at Caleb's head, but he ducks and throws her against 
    the wall. He kicks her into the air and punches her in the stomach before 
    she falls to the ground again. He kicks her in the head and grabs the scythe, 
    but Buffy kicks it out of his hands and into the air. Buffy grabs the scythe 
    and kicks Caleb to the floor. She goes to stab him with the stake-end of the 
    scythe, but he stops her from plunging it into his chest. Caleb laughs and 
    pushes Buffy away, taking the scythe away from her and throwing it to the 
    ground as he walks toward her. He punches her repeatedly until she falls to 
    the floor.</i></p>

    You know, I gave you ample warning. Told you not to interfere, but you chose 
    not to heed.</p>
<p><i>Buffy charges toward Caleb, but he deflects her and throws her onto a 
    sarcophagus. She kicks him. He picks her up by the lapels and swings her body 
    into a stone pillar so hard that it moves one of the stones out of place. 
    Buffy falls to the ground, and Caleb picks up the scythe.</i></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    I was kind of hoping it'd go this way. (rears back with the scythe as he stares

<p><i>Buffy and Caleb fight. Caleb takes the scythe away from Buffy and punches 
    her, sending her stumbling across the room. Caleb points the stake-end of 
    the scythe at Buffy and charges toward her, with her back against the wall,

    out of the wall and kicks Caleb away from her. </i></p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    God, I missed watching this.</p>
<p><i>Buffy swings the scythe at Caleb, slicing his stomach. He stumbles back,

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    See? Under control.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Well...at least you could tell me you're glad to see me. (walks toward Buffy)</p>
<p><i>Buffy drops the scythe to the floor and walks up to Angel, pressing herself 
    against his body and kisses him deeply on the lips. </i></p>
<p><i>Pan over to show Spike is in the tomb as well, hiding behind the pillar, 
    watching them. Buffy/First is beside him, whispering in his ear.</i></p>
