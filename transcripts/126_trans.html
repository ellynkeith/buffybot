<h3>Prologue:</h3>
<p><b>6     INT.     MORTUARY 
    SOMEWHERE IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT<br/>
    A woman in her fifties is laid out in a coffin.</b></p>
<p><b>MORTUARY MAN 1 (O.S.)</b><br/>
  You did good work on her. She looks good.</p>
<p><b>MORTUARY MAN 2 (O.S.)</b><br/>
  Thanks. She's all set for the service tomorrow.</p>
<p><i>Two men in black suits walk past the coffin.</i></p>
<p><b>MORTUARY MAN 1 (O.S.)</b><br/>
  Good. All right then. I'll see you in the morning. </p>
<p><b>MORTUARY MAN 2 (O.S.)</b><br/>
  G'night.</p>
<p><i>They turn the light off on their way out and shut the door. Pan out. There 
    are several other closed coffins in the room. A few seconds later, one of 
    the other coffins opens, and Buffy climbs out with a flashlight. Then Xander 
    climbs out of another coffin.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Hey.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (jumps) Sorry.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    33 minutes. Since when do we go through all this trouble for one lousy vampire. 
    Excuse me, one lousy potential vampire.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Vampire by vampire. It's the only way I know how.</p>
<p><i>There's a knocking sound from one of the smaller coffins. Buffy and Xander 
    go to open it, and Dawn, who was fairly cramped, gets out, gasping for air.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  I think this thing has a freakin' child lock on it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Shh!</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  You know, I'm not the shortest one here. I don't know why I had to be in the 
  kid coffin.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Look, I know it's my job—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  No, no. I'm sorry. I wanna help. I guess I've been a bit stressed out lately. 
  I'm sorry I took it out on you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No big. Been kinda stressed myself.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Well, the whole Willow sitch is not unstressifying.I mean she's here, but not 
  "part of the gang" here and hopefully not "under my feet here 
  in another time dimension" here.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    There's Willow. There's the looming humongo bad. And it's a school night. 
    I should be home in bed, cuddled up to my insomnia, and worrying about how 
    I'm gonna mess up tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  You'll be fine. You'll be a great counselor.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It's my first week actually talking to the kids. What if their problems are 
  all weird and tricky?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I think you underestimate your familiarity with the world of weird and tricky. 
  This job's perfect for you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Check out perfect me. </p>
<p><i>Buffy walks toward the casket containing the dead woman. Dawn and Xander 
    follow her. Buffy shines the flashlight in the dead woman's face, inspecting 
    her.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Taking my sister on an educational outing to the—</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Dead body.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I don't know. Amateur opinion here, but she looks dead. I mean like natural 
  causes dead. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  The paper said she had unusual cuts and contusions on her neck.</p>
<p><i>Buffy shines the flashlight on the dead woman's neck, and right below her 
    pearl necklace there are two puncture wounds that have been stitched up.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Maybe she cut herself shaving and then died naturally of embarrassment.</p>
<p><i>Buffy hands the flashlight to Xander.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  She looks...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Peaceful.</p>
<p><i>The woman in the casket opens her eyes, and they're yellow, like a vampire's.</i></p>
<p><b>DEAD WOMAN</b><br/>
  I am not peaceful.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  That, I can help with.</p>
<p><i>Buffy takes out a stake and plunges it into the lady's heart, turning her 
    into dust.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I always thought closed caskets were more tasteful anyway.</p>
<p><i>Buffy closes the lid to the woman's casket.</i></p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<p><b>7     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    School is in session. There are students wandering the halls. Buffy is arranging 
    and rearranging her desk. Then she decides to sharpen all her pencils. A student 
    walks up to her mid-sharpening. The girl, skinny with long brown hair, looks 
    kind of timid and introverted.</b></p>
<p><b>INTROVERTED GIRL</b><br/>
  Hello?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (startled) Come in! (hides the pencils) Hi.</p>
<p><b>INTROVERTED GIRL</b><br/>
  Mr. Miller sent me here.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Do you know why?</p>
<p><b>INTROVERTED GIRL</b><br/>
  I'm not sure. Maybe 'cause this guy was picking on me.</p>
<p><b>Cut to: </b></p>
<p><b>8     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    A young, tough-looking boy is standing in Buffy's cubicle wearing a grey hooded 
    sweatshirt with the hood pulled up over his head.</b></p>
<p><b>TOUGH BOY</b><br/>
  I don't wanna talk to you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  OK. That's fine.</p>
<p><b>TOUGH BOY</b><br/>
  I'm serious. I don't wanna talk.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  OK.</p>

<p><b>9     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    A tall, good-looking, confident boy is talking to Buffy. He's wearing a stylish 
    knit sport shirt and looks kind of preppy.</b></p>
<p><b>CONFIDENT BOY</b><br/>
  You know, I hate to miss Bio, but I thought it was best I come speak with you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  So, what's on your mind?</p>
<p><b>CONFIDENT BOY</b><br/>
  On my mind?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Are you worried about school? Uh, friends, girls, your parents?</p>
<p><b>CONFIDENT BOY</b><br/>
  Yeah, yeah, that's it. My parents.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  What about them?</p>
<p><b>CONFIDENT BOY</b><br/>
  Oh, issues... of divorce.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>10     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Resume Buffy's conversation with the introverted girl.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You know, it's awful... being teased. But the thing is, you know, with bullies 
  like this, they're really just—</p>
<p><b>INTROVERTED GIRL</b><br/>
  Insecure? Yeah, everyone says that. You know, I'm really tired of everyone being 
  so insecure.</p>
<p><b>Cut to: </b></p>
<p><b>11     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>

    his best tough face. He sits down at Buffy's desk.</b></p>

    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Resume Buffy's conversation with confident boy.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Divorce is terrible. My parents got divorced when I was a kid.</p>
<p><b>CONFIDENT BOY</b><br/>
    Yeah, my parents are happily married. (Buffy glares) It's hard. Uh, I feel... 
    left out. B-but I'm also concerned about girls. (laughs nervously) OK, I'm 
    just bored. Maybe I should get back to Bio?</p>
<p><i>Buffy nods, and the boy walks away.</i></p>

    Resume Buffy's conversation with the introverted girl.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You have to stick up for yourself, Amanda. You need to show this bully that 
    you're not gonna take any more of his sh—guff. Uh, any guff.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA/INTROVERTED GIRL</b><br/>
  'Cause that's what I did. I stuck up for myself. The other day after class, 
  I jumped him in the parking lot, and I slammed his stupid-ass insecure face 
  right into the pavement.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You what?</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
  I guess that's another reason Mr. Miller wanted me to see you. (Buffy sighs) 
  Do you think I should pound on him some more?</p>
<p><b>Cut to: </b></p>
<p><b>14     EXT.     PARK 
    IN SUNNYDALE - DAY<br/>
    Willow and Xander are walking through a park, talking. Willow's wearing black.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I bet she's giving them great advice.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Absolutely! Those kids are lucky to have Buffy looking out for them. I just 
  wish she believed it. She's still stressing over the whole "dropped out 
  of college, not actually qualified" thing. Plus the salivating hellmouth 
  underneath her feet and the whole—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  From beneath you, it devours. It's not the friendliest jingle, is it? It's no 
  "I like Ike" or "Milk: it does a body good."</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I know. It's gonna be bad. It's gonna be real bad. And I wonder, will I— Well, 
  if it comes— When it comes, will I be able to help?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I think so.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I don't know. I don't know what I can do. I mean, frankly, I'm—I'm scared of 
  what I might do.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Yeah, I get that. Figuring out how to control your magic seems a lot like 
    hammering a nail. (Willow looks confused) Well, uh, hear me out. So you're 
    hammering, right? OK, well at the end of the hammer, you have the power, but 
    no control. It takes, like, two strokes to hit the nail in, or you could hit 
    your thumb.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Ouch.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  So you choke up. Control, but no power. It could take like ten strokes to knock 
  the nail in. Power, control. It's a tradeoff.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  That's actually not a bad analogy.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Thanks.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Except... I'm less worried about hitting my thumb, and more worried about 
    going all black-eyed baddy and bewitching that hammer into cracking my friends' 
    skulls open like coconuts.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Right. Ouch.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Sorry. (beat) Xander, being back here... I don't know...</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  It'll take time. (sighs, they stop walking) Are you sure you're ready for this?</p>
<p><i>Willow nods and walks forward without Xander. Pan out to show they are 
    at a graveyard now. Willow walks by herself past many graves before coming 
    up to a tombstone. She puts a handful of rocks on the headstone, and kneels 
    in front of it. The following text is carved on the stone:</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Tara Maclay<br/>
    Oct 16, 1980 - May 7, 2002</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

    desk.</b></p>
<p><b>TOUGH BOY</b><br/>
  I'm scared. I don't want to be left all alone. My brother's joining up with 
  the Marines. Whew. You know, if he knew I was making a fool of myself, he'd 
  smack me in my head. I guess I'm just being stupid.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Sounds like your brother's pretty tough.</p>
<p><b>TOUGH BOY</b><br/>
  Yeah, he's a man. I'm just all messed up right now.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You are not messed up. It is not messed up to worry about your brother.</p>
<p><b>TOUGH BOY</b><br/>
  What if he doesn't come back? What if he gets blown up?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Have you talked to him? Have you told him how you feel?</p>
<p><b>TOUGH BOY</b><br/>
  No. No, I don't wanna talk to him. I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk 
  to him.</p>

    and horn-rimmed glasses.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  So, Josh, what's on your mind?</p>
<p><b>JOSH</b><br/>
  Well, I'm worried that I'm... gay.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  OK, first of all, I... I think it's great that you would come and talk to me 
  about this. And second of all, you should know that there is nothing shameful 
  about being gay. Nothing.</p>
<p><b>JOSH</b><br/>
  I-I know. It's just—I'm not positive, so, uh, I was thinking that... why don't 
  you go on, uh, a date with me so I can be sure.</p>

    Buffy is counseling yet another student. She seems flustered with this student, 
    holding her head in her hand before finally speaking.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It sounds like it's difficult for you. Like maybe your sister makes it hard 
  for you to establish your own identity. You said she's controlling, she doesn't 
  let you make your own decisions—</p>
<p><i>The student she's counseling turns out to be Dawn, who's sporting an attitude.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Yeah, and she borrows my clothes without asking.</p>

    wearing a black t-shirt and purple streaks in her blonde hair.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  So, you're not doing your homework.</p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
  I guess not. It all just... seems kind of ... whatever.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I know high school can seem kind of frustrating. But if you just get through 
  it, then you can go to college, you know, or you can join the French Foreign 
  Legion, or anything you want.</p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
  (smiles) Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  OK, no Foreign Legion. I get that. I mean all the changing your name, and being 
  indentured for all those years, and occupying Algeria...</p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
  (laughs) It's just that I'm not graduating from high school.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Why not?</p>

  No way.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (confused) OK then. Then what are you saying?</p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>
  Look, I don't mean to be a pain. You seem really nice, and I know you're just 
  trying to help. But I'm wasting your time.</p>

  But you can't, OK? I gotta go. (stands up, gathers her things) Trig. I don't

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Cassie, please—</p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>
    Thanks for being so nice. I really do like that shirt. (touches her own shoulder)

    OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Buffy's standing, panicked, talking to Principal Wood, who's calm, sitting 
    behind his desk.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Well, you did what you were supposed to do. You reported the situation to me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  And...</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
    Listen, Buffy, it's hard. Kids this age... they're hurting, they're pissed 
    off, and they say things. Sometimes they say awful things. (stands up, walks 
    to coffee maker, pours coffee) When I was in high school, I had a thing with 
    this guy, right? Real bully. I kept telling everyone that he'd better sleep 
    with one eye open 'cause I was gonna bust his ass. Well, I got suspended. 
    Talk like that is taken pretty seriously where I come from.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  The hood?</p>
<p><i>Principal Wood stops pouring his coffee and looks at Buffy.</i></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Beverly Hills... which is a hood. </p>
<p><i>Buffy looks embarrassed. Principal Wood finishes preparing coffee, and walks 
    toward Buffy with a cup of coffee for each of them. He hands one mug to Buffy.</i></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Listen, the point is, I was talking big because I was scared. I couldn't bust 
  a move back in high school, let alone someone's ass. Most of the time, that's 
  what it is when these students act out. Fear, pain—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  But sometimes, it's not just talk, right?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  (walking back to sit at desk) Every time there's a threat like this, we do the 
  same dance. Inform teachers, search lockers, but we can't—we can't know what's 
  gonna happen, and we can't search their brains. We just—we just do what we 
  can.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It's not enough. I need to fix this. I don't usually get a heads up before somebody 
  dies.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  What do you mean usually?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (animated, talking with hands) No. No, not since—I mean, I'm sure it's not 
  usual to get a chance to stop something like—I just I need to do something, 
  OK? (walks toward Principal's desk) I have to make this better— (trips over 
  something, and spills coffee on her shirt) Oh! Oh, shoot.</p>

  be rejected? Nobody. I'm thinking, some people can't handle the rejection. I'm

<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Well, there's nothing in this one. What've you got?</p>
<p><i>Mike walks by, and Buffy stops him.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Where's your hall pass?</p>
<p><b>MIKE</b><br/>
  No hall pass. I got a free period. </p>
<p><i>He starts to go on by, but Buffy steps in his way again.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You seem kind of upset. Something on your mind?</p>
<p><b>MIKE</b><br/>
  No, not really. (holds up a graded paper) Well, I got a lousy "B" 
  in Egyptian history. Knew this stuff cold, so that, you know, that pisses me 
  off.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You get... pissed off a lot?</p>
<p><b>MIKE</b><br/>
  No, I—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Let me cut to the chase. I hear you can't get a date for the winter formal.</p>
<p><b>MIKE</b><br/>
  Oh, whoa, look, I know it's your job to talk to kids with problems, but honestly 
  I don't have any. I'm fine. (Buffy seems suspicious) All right, look, it's really 
  no big deal. I have a friend that I really wanted to take—I don't know, I guess 
  she doesn't see me that way. (laughs) She makes me crazy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Crazy?</p>
<p><b>MIKE</b><br/>
  Yeah, sometimes I jus— That's funny. You're Dawn's sister, right?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Uh, that's right. Dawn is my sister.</p>
<p><b>MIKE</b><br/>
  Oh, that's so weird. I was just thinking about her. Yeah, I was thinking if, 
  you know, Cassie won't budge, maybe I'll ask Dawn.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You aren't mad at Cassie, with her rejecting you like that?</p>
<p><b>MIKE</b><br/>
  Nah, she's a girl right? Making boys crazy is like your job description.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (suddenly offended) You're asking my sister to the dance, and she's your second 
  choice?</p>
<p><i>Behind Mike, Principal Wood and the security guard open a locker and lots 
    of coins fall out onto the hall floor. Buffy notices the commotion.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (to Mike) I'll be keeping an eye on you.</p>
<p><i>Buffy goes to the locker to check out the coins with the Principal and the 
    security guard.</i></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
  Seems like someone's got quite a coin collection, huh?</p>

<p><b>BOY</b><br/>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    To help. I'm a counselor here because I wanna help. I know what it's like 
    to walk these halls and feel lost, alone. I just want to make things better, 
    connect. (stands and intimidates) And I'm going to connect with your face 
    if you don't stop wasting my time and help me do my job.</p>

  (pulls off Cassie's blindfold) This is our sacrifice. (picks up a large cleaver) 
  It's nothing personal. It's just that you have this death-kick suicidal vibe 
  going. I figure if you disappear, everybody'll just assume you threw yourself 
  in a river somewhere. Extinguish.</p>

  Do you know how lame this is? Bored teenage boys trying to raise up a demon. 
  Sorry it didn't show. I bet it's 'cause you forgot the boom box playing some

  of lame demons.</p>

    to Cassie. Buffy sweeps the torch in front of the demon's face. Spike punches 
    Peter, knocking him to the ground. Buffy jabs the torch into the demon's abdomen 
    cavity. Spike's on top of Peter, pummeling him ferociously. After each punch, 
    Spike pauses to hold his aching head, then he punches Peter again.</i></p>

    over Peter while he stands. The demon has caught on fire from Buffy's torching 
    it. Spike uses the cleaver gently to cut the ties on Cassie's hands, then 
    he takes off the duct tape on her mouth. The demon has burned to a crisp. 
    Cassie's crying, but calms down enough to tell Spike something.</i></p>
