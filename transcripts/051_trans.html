<p>  Night, in front of the cinema. Marquee: Le Banquet D'Amelia.
<br/>  Buffy and Angel walk out amidst other moviegoers.
<p>Buffy: Well.
<p>Angel: Well.
<p>Buffy: That was very ... artistic.
<p>Angel: Yeah.
<p>Buffy: Wasn't what I expected. I've never actually seen... Well,
<br/>from the title I thought it was about food.
<p>Angel: Well there was food.
<p>Buffy: Right. The, the scene with the, the food. So, feel like
<br/>getting some hot chocolate? Or some cold shower?
<p>Angel: I'm sorry. I wanted to take you out somewhere fun. It's been
<br/>a long time since I've been to the movies. They changed.
<p>Buffy: A little scary. And a little not, which is also scary. I'm
<br/>sorry. I just, I don't like getting you worked up like that.
<br/>We can't actually do any of those things. You'd lose your soul.
<br/>Besides, I don't even own a kimono.
<p>Angel: Buffy, you don't have to worry about me.
<p>Buffy: Just don't like to rub your nose in it. Suddenly wondering
<br/>where that expression comes from.
<p>Angel: Look, I don't need to see movies to get worked up. Just being
<br/>around you does that just fine. Doesn't mean that I'm gonna lose
<br/>control, that I'm going to be frustrated around you. It feels nice,
<br/>just to feel.
<p>Buffy: It doesn't drive you crazy, when we're close?
<p>Angel: Watch this. (long kiss) See? Safe as houses. (more kisses)
<p>Faith: Check out the lust bunnies.
<p>Buffy: Patrol?
<p>  Faith nods.
<p>Angel: Council has you back on active duty?
<p>Faith: Finally. They want us down by Mercer.
<p>Buffy: Okay. (to Angel) Goodnight.
<p>Angel: I'll see you soon.
<p>Faith: Don't worry, big guy. Just keeping her warm for you.
<p>  Faith and Buffy leave, arm in arm. Cut to a cemetary. Buffy
<br/>  and Faith walk together.
<p>Faith: Gotta tell you, B. The willpower thing, nice job.
<p>Buffy: Thanks.
<p>Faith: But, the close but no cigar thing with Angel. I don't know
<br/>if I could handle, you know, the way you're not handling it.
<p>Buffy: Faith, when it comes to Angel, do me a favor. Duck!
<p>  Faith ducks and Buffy punches a demon behind her.
<p>Demon: Ow! Ooh! What are you, nuts? Going around punching
<br/>people?
<p>  Buffy pulls off its hat to reveal two horns growing out of its
<br/>  forehead.
<p>Buffy: People?
<p>Demon: So what, I'm a demon. That makes it okay?
<p>  Both Slayers ready their stakes.
<p>Demon: Hold it, whoa! Stake me now, and you never find out what I
<br/>got for ya, huh? Think about it. Demon seeks Slayers, highly unusual?
<p>Faith: Talk fast.
<p>Demon: How would you like to get your hands on the Books of
<br/>Ascension?
<p>Buffy: Never heard of 'em.
<p>Demon: Books of Ascension. Very powerful works and I'm not talking
<br/>about the prose. They deal with some, ah, dark stuff. And the Mayor
<br/>(Faith frowns) would hate for somebody to get ahold before he, ah,
<br/>well you know.
<p>Buffy: Don't know. Before he what?
<p>Demon: Hey, hey, read 'em and weep. That's all I got to say.
<br/>Tomorrow, I get the books. Meet me here and if the price is right,
<br/>well I give the books to you.
<p>Buffy: Not really looking to trade with a demon.
<p>Demon: And if this were still a barter economy, that would be a
<br/>problem. I want cash, princess, five large for the whole set.
<p>Faith: So you can buy, I'm guessing here, some skin care products.
<p>Demon: Plane ticket. Out of the Hellmouth before its adios, Slayer
<br/>Loco. So, five G's, what do you say?
<p>Faith: I think "Die Fiend" sums it up, wouldn't you say.
<p>  The Demon jumps between them and runs away.
<p>Buffy: Oh, let him go. I don't think he falls into the deadly threat
<br/>to humanity category.
<p>Faith: A demon's a demon.
<p>Buffy: I'd like to know about these Books of Ascension. Anything that
<br/>would pin the Mayor down would be great.
<p>Faith: Yeah. It'd be great.
<p>  Opening credits.
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------
<p>  Mayor's office. Faith sits. The Mayor paces.
<p>Mayor: And what exactly did this demon look like?
<p>Faith: Demonic?
<p>Mayor: Ah. And you say he has the Books of Ascension, or will soon,
<br/>and he was, what, willing to sell them?
<p>Faith: That's what I said.
<p>Mayor: Hmm. You know what I wish? I wish you'd pull your hair back.
<br/>I know, I know, fashion's not exactly my thing, but, gosh darn
<br/>it, you know, you've got such a nice face. I can't understand
<br/>why you hide it.
<p>Faith: Yeah, sure. Whatever. It's just a matter of time before this
<br/>demon guy is gonna spill. Then Buffy and the superfriends are
<br/>gonna...
<p>Mayor: You know, you worry too much for a girl for your age. That's
<br/>unnecessary stress. Luckily, I've got just the thing.
<p>  The Mayor pours a glass of milk and hands it to Faith.
<p>Mayor: There you go. Now, first you load up on calcium. Then find
<br/>this demon, kill the heck out of him, and bring the books to me.
<p>  Faith looks at the milk and sets the glass down, untouched.
<p>Faith: And if Buffy gets to him first?
<p>Mayor: Oh, well. Frankly I don't like to think about that. I like
<br/>good, positive, up thoughts. If you fail me in that way. Well, you
<br/>know, replacing Mr. Trick was chore enough. (chuckles) Oh, come on,
<br/>don't worry. Drink up. There's nothing uncool about healty teeth
<br/>and bones.
<p>         ------------------------------------------
<p>  In the library. Buffy, Xander, and Willow sit at the table.
<br/>  Wesley stands by it. Giles stands in the door of his office.
<p>Wesley: And you say this demon wanted cash? That's very unusual.
<p>Giles: Demons after money. Whatever happened to the still beating
<br/>heart of a virgin? No one has any standards anymore.
<p>Buffy: Well, he said the books were worth the price.
<p>Xander: What's this Ascenscion mean?
<p>  Wesley looks at Giles.
<p>Giles: I'm not sure.
<p>Wesley: No, not really a common term in demonology.
<p>Willow: Ooh ooh! The Marenschadt Text. I think in the section on
<br/>genocide, they mention Ascenscion.
<p>Buffy: Well, we have a winner.
<p>Xander: And, more importantly, two losers.
<p>Giles: Where did you find that volume?
<p>Willow: In the top of your book cabinet with the stuff you try to
<br/>keep hidden.
<p>  Giles disappears into his office to get the book.
<p>Xander: Hidden? Are there any engravings I should know about?
<br/>Uh, frolicking nymphs of some kind?
<p>Willow: No. Just magic secrets Giles doesn't think I'm ready for.
<p>  Giles returns with the book.
<p>Giles: Ah, yes, yes, here we are. There's a reference here to the
<br/>journal of Desmond Kane, pastor of a town called Sharpsville.
<br/>"May 26, 1723. Tomorrow is the Ascenscion. God help us all."
<br/>It was the last anyone heard.
<p>Wesley: Of Kane?
<p>Giles: Of Sharpsville. The town more or less disappeared.
<p>Buffy: So Ascenscion possibly not a love-in.
<p>Giles: I think you should meet with this demon, Buffy.
<p>Buffy: Yeah? Anybody got five thousand dollars?
<p>  Cordelia enters and approaches Wesley.
<p>Cordelia: I have something important to ask you.
<p>Xander: Important? Let's start calculating those odds, people.
<p>Cordelia: What are you doing Friday night?
<p>Wesley: Uh, I, uh, as always my sacred duty as a Watcher prevents
<br/>me from, ah... Why?
<p>Cordelia: I have a paper to write for English and you're English, so
<br/>I thought ... (sees the looks from Buffy and Xander) What? Is it
<br/>so wrong to be getting an insider's perspective? (to Wesley) I
<br/>study best in a good restaurant, around eightish? Think it over?
<p>  Wesley is speechless. Cordelia exits.
<p>Xander: And on the day the words "flimsy excuse" were redefined, we
<br/>stood in awe and watched.
<p>Wesley: Right! Books of Ascenscion, Mayor, slaughter. Tell you what.
<br/>Why don't we try to find this demon sooner rather than later?
<br/>Perhaps persuade him to lend us the books free of charge.
<p>Buffy: I think Faith might be useful in that persuasion part.
<p>Wesley: I imagine so. Where is Faith anyway?
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  The demon is frantically packing a suitcase. Faith kicks open
<br/>  the door of the room.
<p>Demon: Hey, Slayer! You know, I wasn't expecting company. Give me
<br/>a minute and I'll have the place tidied up for you.
<p>Faith: You got the books?
<p>Demon: Well, that depends. You got my money?
<p>  Faith slugs him.
<p>Demon: You're tough in negotiations and I respect that. Check 'em
<br/>out. Now ah, that is quality merchandise. That's worth five grand
<br/>easy.
<p>Faith: Books of Ascenscion.
<p>Demon: Mm hmm. Original editions and everything. Uh, great
<br/>condition. Okay, it's a little worn on one spine, some slight
<br/>foxing, but otherwise, perfect. Now, the five grand, it's ah, you
<br/>know, negotiable.
<p>Faith: I don't like to haggle.
<p>  She pulls a knife and stabs the demon. He struggles, they roll
<br/>  on the floor, but she finally kills him. She stares at the
<br/>  blood on her hands.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  Night, in Angel's mansion. Angel is reading. Faith enters.
<p>Angel: Faith.
<p>Faith: Angel. I got nowhere else to go. Look, I hate asking for help,
<br/>but I'm asking, cause, uh, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. The real
<br/>bad kind.
<p>Angel: It's okay.
<p>Faith: No, it's a couple of county lines over from okay, believe me.
<p>Angel: Look, just talk. Come on. Start from the beginning.
<p>Faith: Mind if I skip past the 'mom never loved me' part and get right
<br/>to it? I'm scaring myself.
<p>Angel: I know the feeling.
<p>Faith: That's why I came to you. I don't want to get all twelve
<br/>steppy, but remember when you told me that killing people would
<br/>make me feel like some kind of god? (shows him her bloody hands)
<br/>I think I just came down to earth. It's not human if that's what
<br/>you're thinking. Not that that makes me feel any better or this
<br/>guy any less dead.
<p>Angel: Faith, you need help. You can't do this alone.
<p>Faith: I know. For real now, I'm scared. Scared of what I am, what
<br/>I'm turning into. Cold-blooded straight up killer. Like you.
<p>Angel: Not like me. I didn't have a choice. But you do. You can stop
<br/>this.
<p>Faith: Believe me, I don't want to end up the way everybody said I
<br/>would, dead or alone or a loser.
<p>Angel: No, you don't have to.
<p>Faith: I don't know. Maybe it's too late for me.
<p>Angel: It's not.
<p>Faith: Angel, I'm so scared. (hugs him)
<p>Angel: It's alright, shh, it's okay.
<p>  They hug for a moment, then as they part, they hesitate, almost
<br/>  kissing. Angel pulls away.
<p>Angel: Whoa. Faith, I, look, I can be here for you. But not like that,
<br/>alright? I'm with Buffy.
<p>Faith: Buffy, yeah. I didn't mean it like that. Maybe I did, but I
<br/>wouldn't press it. You love her, don't you.
<p>Angel: I love her.
<p>Faith: Good for you. The two of you, you're lucky. Friends?
<p>Angel: Yeah, we're friends.
<p>Faith: Then I'm lucky too. I'd better go.
<p>Angel: Where?
<p>Faith: I need to cool down. Spend some time alone. Don't worry about
<br/>me. You've been a big help. Just knowing somebody cares. Hey, I know
<br/>I shouldn't be asking this, but do you think if things were different
<br/>that things between you and me would be different, too?
<p>Angel: We'll never know.
<p>Faith: Right. How could we?
<p>Angel: Take care of yourself.
<p>Faith: Lifetime of practice.
<p>  Faith kisses Angel on the cheek, then leaves. Buffy appears
<br/>  outside the mansion in time to see the kiss.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  Night, in Faith's new apartment.
<p>Faith: It's not like I wasn't trying, okay?
<p>Mayor: Hey, there's no need to convince me. I'm sure you gave it your
<br/>level best. I just don't understand what that boy could be thinking?
<p>Faith: Try Buffy Summers, like in a big, fat, one track way.
<p>Mayor: Hey, come on, don't be discouraged. You're a bright, young,
<br/>energetic girl with a whole life ahead of her. And I won't tolerate
<br/>brooding. So you couldn't give him that one moment of true happiness.
<p>Faith: I was thinking more along the lines of a long weekend, but
<br/>okay.
<p>Mayor: And he spurns your advances. So be it. There's more than one
<br/>way to skin a cat. And I happen to know that's factually true. We
<br/>want to take Angel's soul away. If we can't do it by giving him
<br/>happiness, well, by golly, we'll just have to do it in the most
<br/>painful way imaginable.
<p>  Fade to commercial.
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------
<p>  In the library.
<p>Wesley: Find anything?
<p>Giles: Six course banquet of nothing with a scoop of sod-all as a
<br/>palate closer.
<p>Wesley: I've had no better luck. There must be something about this
<br/>Ascescion somewhere.
<p>Giles: Perhaps I should contact the Council, maybe run a search...
<p>Wesley: No. I don't, uh, it should be I that ... The Council isn't
<br/>entirely aware that I'm letting you work for me (off Giles's
<br/>look) um, with me. I don't think they'd be very happy at the idea
<br/>of the two of us collaborating.
<p>Giles: Well I wasn't about to burst into glorious song about it
<br/>myself. Why don't you call?
<p>  Buffy enters, dispirited.
<p>Wesley: I think the most expedient plan would be to find these Books
<br/>of Ascenscion themselves. Buffy, you and Faith must find this demon,
<br/>and soon.
<p>Buffy: Well, I'll go back to the scene, see if I can track him.
<p>Wesley: Wait for Faith.
<p>Buffy: That could be hours. The girl makes Godot look punctual. I'll
<br/>just go myself.
<p>Wesley: Buffy, this is a job for the both of you. This demon could
<br/>be anywhere.
<p>  Giles gives Buffy a look of concern.
<p>Wesley: If these books are important as he says, he has good reason
<br/>to hide. (Xander enters) Finding him is going to be extremely
<br/>difficult.
<p>Xander: Found your demon.
<p>Buffy: Fashion tip, Wes. Mouth looks better closed.
<p>Xander: Got the address. (hands Buffy a slip of paper) I beat it out
<br/>of Willy the snitch personally.
<p>Buffy: You beat up Willy?
<p>Xander: Sure! Well, actually, let's just say I applied some pressure.
<br/>Or more accurately, that I asked politely, and then, uh, okay, I
<br/>bribed him.
<p>Buffy: How much?
<p>Xander: Twenty-eight bucks. (to Giles) Does the Council reimburse for
<br/>that kind of stuff?
<p>Giles: Did you get a receipt?
<p>Xander: Damn.
<p>Buffy: I know this. It's down by the bus station. Not the nicest part
<br/>of town.
<p>Giles: Again. See, no standards. I mean, any self-respecting demon
<br/>should be living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt.
<p>Buffy: I'll remember to mention that.
<p>  Faith enters.
<p>Faith: Mention what? Where we going, girlfriend?
<p>Buffy: (pulls her arm away from Faith) Actually, I can handle this
<br/>one solo.
<p>Faith: Why should you get to have all the fun? Share, share, that's
<br/>fair, right?
<p>Buffy: Right. Got our demon.
<p>Faith: Oh, well, let's go look him up.
<p>  Buffy marches away and Faith follows her.
<p>Xander: Is it me or did it just get really cold in here?
<p>         ---------------------------------------
<p>  Buffy and Faith enter the demon's room.
<p>Buffy: Faith, careful.
<p>Faith: Right.
<p>Buffy: Missed you last night.
<p>Faith: Yeah, I was patrolling. No shortage of scum you gotta watch
<br/>in Sunnydale, right?
<p>Buffy: So I've heard.
<p>  Faith reaches around a doorway for a light switch without looking.
<br/>  Buffy notices but doesn't say anything. They see the body.
<p>Buffy: Looks like somebody got here first.
<p>Faith: Betting they got the books, too. Some hit.
<p>Buffy: This wasn't just a hit. This was somebody's idea of a party.
<p>Faith: Maybe the guy put up a fight. We gotta get going. Come on,
<br/>nothing we can do here now. You coming?
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  Daylight. In the Mayor's office. Across from him sits a mage
<br/>  concealed behind Bedouin robes. Only his eyes and upper nose
<br/>  are visible. The eyes seem serpentine.
<p>Mayor: Mint? Didn't think so. Well, scheduling a man of your talents
<br/>is quite the chore, I'll tell you. Between the chanting and the
<br/>sacrifice, oh, my golf game is shot. But heeere you are. You know
<br/>why I've summoned you. Can you do it? (Mage nods) Need anything from
<br/>me? (Mage shakes his head)
<p>Mage: You have risked great danger in calling on me. The deadliest
<br/>magics are needed to rob this creature of its soul.
<p>Mayor: Big job alright.
<p>Mage: And so it shall be done.
<p>Mayor: Oh, that's just swell. Listen, you sure you don't want any?
<br/>Cause they're, they're low calorie. Okay.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  Daylight. In a school lounge. Buffy and Willow sit together
<br/>  on a couch.
<p>Willow: Are you okay? You seem a little on edge. Is there anything
<br/>that's wrong?
<p>Buffy: It's nothing. (Willow looks) It's nothing. (Willow looks)
<br/>Alright, alright, stop with the third degree. It's Faith.
<p>Willow: What about her?
<p>Buffy: I went to Angel's last night and Faith was there. They looked
<br/>sort of intimate.
<p>Willow: No way. I know what you're thinking and no way!
<p>Buffy: You're right. Faith would never do that.
<p>Willow: Faith would totally do that. Faith was built to do that.
<br/>She's the do that girl.
<p>Buffy: Comfort, remember comfort, here?
<p>Willow: I mean, please, does Angel come up to Faith's standards for
<br/>a guy? Let's see, is he breathing?
<p>Buffy: Actually, no.
<p>Willow: But Buffy, Angel. There's no way he would ever do that.
<br/>I mean, you're the only thing in the world to him.
<p>Buffy: Sometimes I wonder. Angel and Faith have a lot in common.
<br/>And there's so much he doesn't tell me.
<p>Willow: But it's so clear the way he feels about you. Buffy, I too
<br/>know the love of a taciturn man and you have to look at their
<br/>actions.
<p>Buffy: I was.
<p>Willow: Well, what did he say?
<p>Buffy: Say? You mean when I straightforwardly asked him what was
<br/>going on?
<p>Willow: So you bailed?
<p>Buffy: I couldn't. I mean, not ...
<p>Willow: Enough. Stop with the crazy. Go talk to Angel.
<p>Buffy: But I ...
<p>Willow: No. Go. I give you leave to go. (points her finger away)
<p>Buffy: Thank you.
<p>  Buffy leaves.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  Night. In Angel's mansion. Faith enters.
<p>Angel: Faith.
<p>Faith: Hey. Sorry to bust in uninvited.
<p>Angel: What do you want.
<p>Faith: Look, I'm not so good at apologies. Mostly because I think
<br/>the world's out to screw me so I'm generally more owed than
<br/>owing. But I've been thinking about last night and I want you
<br/>to know I was really sorry.
<p>Angel: It's alright, Faith.
<p>Faith: No, it's not alright. Yeah, I was freaked and needed somebody,
<br/>but you're with Buffy. I should know better.
<p>Angel: Yeah, okay.
<p>  When Faith gets within arm's reach, Angel backs away.
<p>Faith: You don't trust me.
<p>Angel: It's not that.
<p>Faith: Hey, no problem. Join the club.
<p>  She turns her back. He approaches her.
<p>Angel: Look, Faith. I know what you're going through, alright, and
<br/>how hard it can be. It's important you have somebody who's been
<br/>there and who understands what you're going through. (He grasps
<br/>Faith by the shoulders and turns her around.) Look, I want to
<br/>trust you.
<p>Faith: Chump.
<p>  She has a vial of blood in her hand and splashes it on his chest.
<br/>  Out of the shadows steps the Mage. His skin is blue and his
eyes
<br/>  shine yellow. He starts chanting a spell.
<p>Angel: Faith!
<p>Faith: I wanted to do this the old-fashioned way, but hey, your
<br/>loss. Lucky I've got some tricks Buffy don't know yet.
<p>Angel: You don't have to do this.
<p>Faith: I know, but it's fun. Now relax, it'll be over soon.
<p>  The Mage continues chanting. Lights flow from his hand and
<br/>  congeal around Angel's body. The lights fade and the Mage
<br/>  disappears into the shadows. Angel falls to the floor. He
<br/>  gets up and his face is vamped. Angel and Faith kiss.
<p>  Fade to commercial.
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------
<p>  The kiss continues.
<p>Angel: Thanks, so much. (slaps Faith away) It's good to have the
<br/>taste of a Slayer back in my mouth. It's like cigarettes,
<br/>you know, just when I thought I'd quit. (kicks Faith in the
<br/>side) No, don't get up. It's good to be back in Sunnydale. Nice
<br/>climate, plenty to eat, no tortured humanity to hold me down.
<br/>(Faith flips herself up.) But you know what bothers me? (Angel
<br/>grabs her by the neck) You don't seem to be getting the big
<br/>picture here, Faith. Now I don't know why you turned me, but I'm
<br/>just glad you did.
<p>  Faith breaks free and kicks him away. She pulls out a stake.
<p>Faith: I've got my reasons.
<p>Angel: Let me guess. You summoned back the true Angelus because
<br/>you need a new boy toy. Doesn't work that way.
<p>  They exchange blows. They stand, Angel holding Faith's stake
<br/>  arm up.
<p>Faith: You wanna be smart? You listen to me.
<p>Angel: Funny thing about vampires, Faith. We don't establish
<br/>meaningful dialogue with Slayers.
<p>Faith: Not how Buffy tells it.
<p>  Faith kicks him in the knee, driving him to the ground, and
<br/>  jumps astride him, threatening him with the stake.
<p>Angel: (chuckles) I should have known you'd like it on top.
<p>Faith: You want to listen or you want to die?
<p>Angel: As long as you're there, I mostly want you to wriggle. But
<br/>I'm listening.
<p>Faith: Last time you got like this, Buffy kicked your ass all the
<br/>way back to hell. You want to do better this time?
<p>Angel: Still listening. (his face shifts to human)
<p>Faith: Good boy. Now all you got to do is play nice and call truce
<br/>and I'll hook you up with the real power in this town. Interested?
<p>Angel: Very.
<p>Faith: Then get ready to meet the new boss.
<p>  They kiss.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  In the library. Buffy, Willow, Oz, Xander, and Cordelia (really
<br/>  bored) sit at
<br/>  the table. Wesley stands in front. Giles stands in the background.
<p>Wesley: Our enemy has us at a disadvantage. We seem to be
<br/>consistently one step behind him. Now he has the Books of Ascenscion.
<br/>We must take definitive action.
<p>Cordelia: You have the greatest voice. Have you ever thought about doing
<br/>books on tape?
<p>Xander: Way to focus CC.
<p>Wesley: Yes, let's, uh, let's try to stay on track. We need everyone
<br/>working together here. Where's Angel?
<p>Buffy: I don't know. I went to the mansion but he wasn't there.
<p>Wesley: And Faith?
<p>Buffy: She's missing too.
<p>Willow: Which means nothing. Two unconnected events.
<p>Buffy: What should we do?
<p>Giles: Buffy, I think you should try to retrieve the Books of
<br/>Ascenscion. Check out the Mayor's office but be damned careful.
<br/>Do not confront the Mayor. We don't know a thing about him.
<p>Buffy: I'll go home and stock up on weapons. Slip into something a
<br/>little more break-and-enterish.
<p>Giles: Right. Willow, how far did you get with the Mayor's files?
<p>Cordelia: Excuse me, I believe Wesley is running this meeting.
<p>Wesley: It's, uh, it's quite alright. Willow?
<p>Willow: It's all bad news. By the time I got through the encryptions,
<br/>the files were empty. Guess he saw me coming.
<p>Oz: What about the Hall of Records? Go to the source.
<p>Wesley: Good idea. There must be information on the Mayor there.
<p>Giles: Wesley, why don't you take the group and start looking?
<p>Wesley: Right.
<p>Cordelia: (pops up) I'm in Wesley's group.
<p>Giles: There is just the one group.
<p>Cordelia: Yes! And I am in it.
<p>Xander: Anyone mind if I skip the trip? I'm gonna cruise town, keep
<br/>my ear to the ground, and I think five's a crowd.
<p>Cordelia: It really is.
<p>Oz: I'll drive.
<p>Willow: (proud of Oz) They liked your plan.
<p>Giles: Anyone finds anything, check in with me. (to Buffy) Be
<br/>careful.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  In the Mayor's office. The Mayor sits behind his desk. Faith
<br/>  and Angel stand in front of it.
<p>Faith: So, can I keep him?
<p>Mayor: Let's just take things step by step for the moment. Now then,
<br/>Angelus, may I call you Angel?
<p>Angel: Well, actually, I'm thinking more along the lines of you
<br/>calling me Master.
<p>Mayor: (unfazed) Ah. You know, Angelus, attitude may get you
<br/>attention, but courtesy wins respect. (chuckles) I am the one
<br/>responsible for your new attitude.
<p>  Angel picks up a letter opener, drags it across the desk
<br/>  surface. He starts prowling around the office.
<p>Angel: That's why I'm here.
<p>Mayor: No problems with the transition? No side effects?
<p>Angel: Had a soul, now I'm free.
<p>Mayor: That's terrific! Poetic too. Not that I read much poetry
<br/>except for those little ones in the Reader's Digest. You know,
<br/>some of those are quite catchy. (chuckles)
<p>Angel: Hey, I don't mean to rush things here but are you trying to
<br/>get to some kind of point?
<p>Mayor: Kids today. Rush rush rush. Well the point, Angel, is
<br/>you're a very powerful young man, good for Faith, and there just
<br/>may be future for you in Sunnydale. I see you're admiring my
<br/>letter opener.
<p>Angel: Well, actually, I was thinking of stabbing you through the
<br/>heart with it.
<p>  The Mayor turns his chair to face Angel and spreads his hands.
<p>Mayor: Please do.
<p>  Angel throws the blade at the Mayor's chest. The Mayor brings
<br/>  his right hand in front of it and the blade embeds itself up
<br/>  to the handle though his palm.
<p>Mayor: Nice shot.
<p>  The Mayor pulls the blade out of his hand and holds his palm
<br/>  up so they can see the wound heal itself in seconds.
<p>Mayor: You see, I'm what you might call impervious. Can't be killed,
<br/>or harmed in any way. (wipes the blade with a tissue) And that's
<br/>just a cornerstone in my plans for this great town of ours.
<p>Angel: Mmmm. Can't be killed, but you don't like germs?
<p>Mayor: Uck, eew, awful things, unsanitary. But my question is, now
<br/>that Faith has brought you back, what are your intentions?
<p>Angel: Well, gee, sir, I thought I'd find that Slayer that's given
<br/>you so much trouble and torture, maim, and kill her.
<p>Mayor: Fine! You know it's nice to see you're not one of those
<br/>slacker types running around town today. Torture Buffy. Killing
<br/>her's fine, just make it a slow one.
<p>Angel: My favorite kind.
<p>Mayor: Wonderful, wonderful. We don't want a replacement Slayer
<br/>anytime soon. They can't all turn out like my girl Faith.
<br/>(Faith smiles) Have fun.
<p>Faith: Let's do it.
<p>Mayor: Uh, try to have her home by eleven.
<p>  Angel and Faith leave.
<p>Mayor: She's not a little girl anymore.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  Night. Xander is walking in a deserted street.
<p>Xander: I love when you talk, Wesley. I love when you sing, Wesley.
<br/>Can you say the words jailbait, Wesley? Limey bastard. (sees
<br/>Angel and Faith approach) Hey guys! Man, where you been? You
<br/>gotta find Buffy. She's going to her place and stocking up on ...
<p>  Angel casually smacks Xander in the jaw without breaking
<br/>  stride. Xander falls limply to the ground. Faith doesn't
<br/>  even look at him.
<p>Angel: That guy just bugs me.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  Night. Angel knocks on Buffy's front door and Joyce opens it.
<p>Joyce: Faith. Angel.
<p>Angel: Hi, Joyce, nice to see you. Is Buffy home?
<p>Joyce: Upstairs. Please tell me it's not some vampire thing.
<p>Angel: The only vampire here is me, Joyce. Say, you change your hair?
<p>Joyce: (shrugs) Highlights.
<p>Angel: Nice.
<p>  Cut to Buffy's room. She's loading a bag with weapons. Faith
<br/>  and Angel enter.
<p>Faith: Knock knock.
<p>Buffy: Where have you guys been?
<p>Angel: Been looking for you. Good thing we found you before we left.
<br/>(kisses the top of Buffy's head)
<p>Faith: We got the books.
<p>Angel: They're at the mansion.
<p>Faith: We'd take 'em to Giles ourselves, but I think strength in
<br/>numbers is the way to go. Come on.
<p>Angel: (Takes the weapons bag) Let me get those for you.
<p>  Cut to the mansion. The trio enters.
<p>Buffy: Okay, let's get the books someplace safe. Where are they?
<p>Angel: Actually, there's been a slight change in plan, Buff.
<p>Buffy: Buff? You just called ... What's the matter with you?
<p>  Faith stands back and watches the show with a little smile.
<p>Angel: Nothing. (his face has vamped) Matter of act, I haven't felt
<br/>this good in a long time.
<p>Buffy: Angel?
<p>Angel: You know, I never properly thanked you for sending me to hell.
<p>Buffy: No.
<p>Angel: Yeah, and I'm just wondering where do I start? Card? Fruit
<br/>basket? Evisceration? (grasps Buffy's arms)
<p>Buffy: No.
<p>Angel: Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Maybe there's still some
<br/>good deep down inside of me that remembers and loves you. If only you
<br/>could reach me. Then again, we have reality.
<p>  Buffy breaks away from him.
<p>Buffy: I will kill you before I let you touch me. Faith, we need to
<br/>get out of here, now.
<p>Faith: Speak for yourself, B. Me, I like it here.
<p>  Angel growls and Buffy turns to him. He knocks her out with a
<br/>  roundhouse blow.
<p>Angel: One thing I learned about Buffy, she's so cute when she's
<br/>sleeping.
<p>  Fade to commercial.
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------
<p>  In the Hall of Records. Wesley, Cordelia, and Willow sit at a
<br/>  table pouring over books.
<p>Cordelia: Hey! I know a way to make investigating the Mayor even more
<br/>boring. On second thought, no, I don't.
<p>  Oz brings a book to the table with an old picture of the Mayor.
<p>Oz: Hey, whoa.
<p>Willow: Whoa. Big hey whoa. Guys, check this out. Wow, like father,
<br/>like son.
<p>  They compare a shiny new photo of the Mayor with the old photo.
<p>Oz: How about like exact same guy, like exact same guy?
<p>Wesley: Mayor Wilkins is over one hundred years old. He's not human.
<p>  Xander enters.
<p>Xander: I, uh, hate to spoil the mood, but this is so much worse than
<br/>you think.
<p>Willow: Xander, what happened to you?
<p>Xander: You know how some people hate to say I told you so? Not me.
<br/>I told you so. Angel's back in the really bad sense, and uh,
<br/>I told you so.
<p>Wesley: Angelus has turned? Xander, this is terribly serious. Are
<br/>you sure?
<p>Xander: Gee, let me think. Kind of hard to tell. Last thing I remember
<br/>was his fist.
<p>Wesley: We must contact Giles immediately.
<p>Xander: Good thinking. Let's waste time with a lively debate. Leave
<br/>Buffy alone. See how dead she gets.
<p>Cordelia: Slow down, Xander. This isn't Wesley's fault.
<p>Xander: Actually, it is. Faith was your responsibility. Guess who's
<br/>Angel's new playmate?
<p>Willow: Faith and Angel? Together?
<p>Xander: Imagine the possibilities.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  In the mansion. Angel (human face) is chaining Buffy to the
<br/>  wall. Faith watches.
<p>Angel: Morning, sleepyhead. You know what I just can't believe? All
<br/>of our time together and we never tried chains. Well, can't dwell
<br/>on the past, especially with the future we have ahead.
<p>Faith: Bondage looks good on you, B. The outfit's all wrong, but,
<br/>hey!
<p>Buffy: You don't know what you're doing.
<p>Faith: Really? Weird, because something about all this just feels so
<br/>right. Maybe it's one of those unhappy childhood things. See, when
<br/>I was a kid I used to beg my mom for a dog. Didn't matter what kind.
<br/>I just wanted, you know, something to love. (kisses Angel) A dog's
<br/>all I wanted. Well, that and toys. (lifts a blanket to reveal
<br/>torture instruments) But mom was so busy, you know, enjoying the
<br/>drinking and passing out parts of life, that I never really got what
<br/>I wanted, until now.
<p>Buffy: Faith, listen to me very closely. Angel's a killer. When he's
<br/>done with me, he'll turn on you.
<p>Angel: She's right. I probably will.
<p>Faith: Yeah? Hunh. Guess we'll just have to keep you around for a
<br/>while then. Before we get started, I just want you to know, if
<br/>you're a screamer, feel free.
<p>Buffy: Why, Faith? What's in it for you?
<p>Faith: What isn't? You know, I come to Sunnydale. I'm the Slayer. I
<br/>do my job kicking ass better than anyone. What do I hear about
<br/>everywhere I go? Buffy. So I slay, I behave, I do the good little
<br/>girl routine. And who's everybody thank? Buffy.
<p>Buffy: It's not my fault.
<p>Faith: Everybody always asks, why can't you be more like Buffy? But
<br/>did anyone ever ask if you could be more like me?
<p>Angel: I know I didn't.
<p>Faith: You get the Watcher. You get the mom. You get the little
<br/>Scooby gang. What do I get? Jack squat. This is supposed to be
<br/>my town!
<p>Buffy: Faith, listen to me!
<p>Faith: Why? So you can impart some special Buffy wisdom, that it?
<br/>Do you think you're better than me? Do you? Say it, you think
<br/>you're better than me.
<p>Buffy: I am. Always have been.
<p>Faith: Um, maybe you didn't notice. Angel's with me.
<p>Buffy: And how did you get him, Faith? Magic? Cast some sort of
<br/>spell? Cause in the real world, Angel would never touch you and we
<br/>both know it.
<p>  Faith backhands Buffy.
<p>Buffy: You had to tie me up to beat me. There's a word for people
<br/>like you, Faith. Loser.
<p>Faith: Uh huh. You're just trying to make me mad so I'll kill you.
<br/>I'm too smart for that. Stick around.
<p>Buffy: For what? Your boss's lame Ascenscion. Like I couldn't stop
<br/>it.
<p>Faith: You can't.
<p>Buffy: I will.
<p>Faith: Keep dreaming. No one can stop the Ascenscion. Mayor's got
<br/>it wired, B. He built this town for demons to feed on and come
<br/>graduation day, he's getting paid. And I'll be sitting at his
<br/>right hand. Assuming he has hands after the transformation. I'm
<br/>not too clear on that part. And all your little lame ass friends
<br/>are going to be kibbles'n'bits. Think about that when your
<br/>boyfriends cutting into you.
<p>Buffy: I never knew you had so much rage in you.
<p>Faith: What can I say? I'm the world's best actor.
<p>Angel: Second best.
<p>  Faith turns to Angel in surprise.
<p>Buffy: Graduation day. You think we missed anything?
<p>Angel: I think we know everything she knows.
<p>Buffy: May I say something? (pulls her hands free) Psych!
<p>Faith: You played me. You played me!
<p>  The Scooby gang bursts in the front door. Faith throws Angel
<br/>  into the gang's path. Faith and Buffy fight. The gang wards
<br/>  off Angelus with crosses and stakes. Buffy and Faith end in
<br/>  a standoff, each holding a knife to the other's throat.
<p>Faith: What are you gonna do, B, kill me? You become me. You're not
<br/>ready for that, yet.
<p>  Faith grabs Buffy's neck and kisses her on the forehead. Faith
<br/>  runs away.
<p>Willow: Are you okay?
<p>  Buffy looks at Angel. Angel avoids her gaze.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  In the library. The Scooby gang and Wesley. Giles and the Mage
<br/>  stand face to face.
<p>Mage: The task is finished.
<p>Giles: Yes. Thank you for coming to me and for that rather effective
<br/>light show you put on.
<p>Mage: This restores the balance between us, Rupert Giles. My debt
<br/>to you is now repaid in full. Do not call upon me.
<p>Giles: I shan't. Peace with you.
<p>Mage: And with you.
<p>  The Mage walks backward, fading into thin air.
<p>Willow: His debt to you is repaid? What did you do?
<p>Giles: I introduced him to his wife.
<p>Wesley: Well, I for one protest. You pitted Slayer against Slayer in
<br/>a dangerous charade that could've gotten them both killed, without
<br/>informing me! I'm telling the Council! (storms off)
<p>Giles: I think you should. (Wesley stops) We have a rogue Slayer on
<br/>our hands. I can't think of anything more dangerous.
<p>Buffy: At least now we know.
<p>Giles: And we know a little bit more about the Ascenscion.
<p>Willow: Graduation day. There's a big scary un-fun. At least Angel's
<br/>not bad, though. That's good, right?
<p>Xander: Yes, I feel so much better knowing that he broke my face in
<br/>a good way. It's a good bruise.
<p>Buffy: (sad) He was only acting, Xander. It was just an act.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  Daylight. In Faith's new apartment.
<p>Mayor: Well, you win some, you lose some. From where I'm sitting,
<br/>it's batting average that counts. So you lost some friends.
<p>Faith: I wouldn't exactly call them friends.
<p>Mayor: Well, what are you worried about? Chin up! You don't see me
<br/>looking disappointed. Heck, no. You know why? Because I know you'll
<br/>always have me, Faith. I'm the best, the most important friend
<br/>you'll ever have. Besides, you know, once the Ascenscion starts,
<br/>the 'in' crowd you're so concerned about? Whoo! They'll be lucky
<br/>if there's enough left of them to fill a pothole. Promise. Still
<br/>unhappy? Okey doke. I've got two words that are going to make all
<br/>the pain go away. Miniature golf. (grins)
<p>  Faith shakes her head and breaks into a big smile.
<p>         ----------------------------------------
<p>  In Angel's mansion. Buffy enters.
<p>Angel: How you doing?
<p>Buffy: Been better.
<p>Angel: Not hard to believe. You were a real soldier last night, Buffy.
<p>Buffy: That's me. One of the troops.
<p>Angel: I know how hard it was for you.
<p>Buffy: I really doubt that.
<p>Angel: Is there anything I can do to make it better?
<p>Buffy: Look, I know you only did what I asked. And we, we got what
<br/>we wanted.
<p>Angel: I never wanted it to go that far.
<p>Buffy: I know that. It's not even a question of that. It's just,
<br/>after ... I need a little bit of a break. Please. (walks away)
<p>Angel: You still my girl?
<p>Buffy: Always. (leaves)
