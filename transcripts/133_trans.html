<p><b>1     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike hands and feet chained to the wall. He lunges at Buffy, who stares him 
    straight in the eyes.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (in his face) I believe in you, Spike. </p>
<p><i>Spike looks at her with a face full of hope and amazement. Just then, 
    the lights flicker and go out. Someone bursts into the basement and pushes 
    Buffy away from Spike. She falls to the ground.</i></p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>2     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Robed men break into the house from all angles, smashing windows and breaking 
    down doors. Covered head to toe in long, black, hooded robes, these people 
    have batons and no eyes</b></p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>3     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy goes down the stairs to the basement, followed by Xander. She stops 
    dead in her tracks when she sees the empty shackles that Spike was supposed 
    to be in.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    They were after Spike all along.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>4     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike is tied to the wheel-like construct with all four corners of his body 
    pulled in opposite directions. Spike's body has symbols carved into his chest. 
    Spike/First morphs into Buffy's form. A Harbinger cranks a wheel attached 
    to a mechanism that hoists the wheel Spike's tied to into the air. Spike is 
    now hanging from the wheel about ten feet from the ground, bleeding steadily 
    from his ritualized symbol-shaped cuts.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY (V.O.)</b><br/>
    You know what we're up against. The First.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?</p>
<p><i>Spike's blood is falling on the Seal of Danthazar that's right below him. 
    It's pooling in the grooves and being absorbed into the seal. The seal starts 
    to glow. One by one, the pointed tips of the pentagram at its center fold 
    up, forming a pyramid. Light comes out from under it. The pyramid sinks into 
    the ground. The remaining pieces of the seal follow suit. A monster climbs 
    out wearing black leather. Pan up to show its horrible disfigured face. It's 
    bald with a distinct vampire forehead and brows and trademark fanged teeth. 
    It looks gaunt, with extremely hollow cheekbones. It raises its hands toward 
    the sky and looks around the room, growling menacingly.</i></p>

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Red light surrounds Willow then enters her body through her nostrils. She 
    throws her head back and a demonic apparition (huge, with two horns on its 
    head and glowy red eyes) escapes her mouth, lunging toward Buffy. The light 
    disappears, and Willow collapses, crying and twitching, while Buffy kneels 
    at her side, holding her head.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    We won't use magic to fight this thing until we know what we're doing.</p>

    HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Buffy opens the front door to leave, but sees Giles standing there on her 
    front porch when she opens it.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Giles.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

    Dawn's standing in front of the three girls Giles brought with him. The three 
    girls are lined up against the wall, and Dawn's inspecting them, arms crossed 
    in front of her. </b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    They're all slayers?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like 
    them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're 
    all on their way to Sunnydale.</p>

    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Buffy and Giles are in the kitchen talking to the three slayers in training, 
    who are already up and eating breakfast. </b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Uh, what you fought was a vampire, but it was, um, something more than that. 
    It was a Turok-Han—ferociously powerful killing machines, as single-minded 
    as animals. I think the Turok-Han is here as an agent of The First.</p>

<p><b>9     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Giles is pacing, talking. The slayers in training are sitting around the dining 
    room table, along with Dawn and Anya. Xander and Willow are leaning against 
    the wall. Buffy walks in, badly beaten from her encounter with the Turok-Han, 
    and addresses the room.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 'em one. 'Cause we just became an 
    army. There is only one thing on this Earth more powerful than evil, and that's 
    us.</p>

<h3><b>PROLOGUE:</b></h3>
<p><b>10     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    BUS STATION - NIGHT<br/>
    A charter bus opens its doors, and a couple of people walk down the steps 
    to exit the vehicle. </b></p>
<p><b>BUS DRIVER</b><br/>
    Sunnydale. Watch your step. Next stop...</p>
<p><i>The last person to exit is a young African-American girl, wearing denim 
    overalls and carrying a backpack. She looks around and walks forward between 
    parked buses to the bus terminal building. The sign overhead reads "OVERLAND 
    CHARTERS". The girl looks at the building, but the doors are closed and 
    no lights are on. </i></p>
<p><i>She looks around anxiously, and goes to the nearby pay phone, grabs the 
    phone book, and start flipping through it. The page she's searching reads 
    "SUNNYDALE" along the side, and "S SOTER-SULLIVAN" across 
    the top. The girl runs her finger down through the names, searching, before 
    she realizes that the page she needs has been torn out of the book. When she 
    looks up from the book, she sees a black-robed, hooded, eyeless man approaching 
    her. She drops the phone book and turns to run, but sees two more of these 
    men, the Bringers, coming toward her with knives in their hands. She backs 
    up against the wall, panicked and breathing heavily, and sinks down to the 
    ground. </i></p>
<p><i>Just then, the pair of Bringers between the buses are lifted off the ground 
    and go flying apart, revealing Buffy, who had thrown them to the ground. The 
    third Bringer runs away while the two Buffy attacked come back for more. One 
    lunges at her with his knife, but Buffy grabs his hand and stabs the other 
    Bringer with the knife he's holding. The stabbed Bringer doubles over in pain, 
    and Buffy kicks him to the ground. Buffy continues to wrestle with the other 
    Bringer, ultimately breaking his neck. Buffy then sees the one who started 
    running away, and calls out to him. </i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (yells) Hey! (bends to pick up a Bringer's knife at her feet) Try picking 
    on someone my own size. </p>
<p><i>Buffy hurls the knife at the fleeing Bringer, landing it in his back, 
    stabbing him through the heart.</i></p>
<p><b>BRINGER</b><br/>
    Ow! Uh! (falls to the ground) </p>
<p><i>Buffy walks up to Rona, who is still cowering on the ground.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Rona, right? (Rona nods) I just got word you were arriving. (offers Rona a 
    hand to help her up)</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (takes Buffy's hand, stands) You're her!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Her is me.</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (still out of breath, looking around the parking lot) You know, I thought, 
    uh—they told me I'd be safe here.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Right. Well, you are. I mean, you will be...safer...with me around. </p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    That's good.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (starts to walk away) Next time you're attacked—</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (follows Buffy, panicked) Whoa, whoa—next time? You saying I'm gonna 
    get attacked again? </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Welcome to the hellmouth.</p>

<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>11     INT.     WILLOW'S 
    BEDROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAYBREAK<br/>
    Pan from window to the bedroom floor, where Willow's tossing and turning in 
    a sleeping bag. </b></p>
<p><b>KENNEDY (O.S.)</b><br/>
    You don't have to do this. </p>
<p><i>Pan up to show Kennedy is lying on the foot of the bed, with one arm bent 
    at the elbow, propping her head up on her hand, talking to Willow.</i></p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Flooring it. In the bag. 'Cause (pats the bed behind her) nice big comfy bed 
    right here. I mean, you ought to know. Your bed.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (wide eyed and stiff, lying on her back) Yeah, but no. I'm OK. I just, I like 
    it down here. (pats the sleeping bag) It's firm.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (chuckles) Funny, you look a little uncomfortable. Or... is it just me?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    No. I'm just, uh, uneasy 'cause Buffy's out.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Right. How many girls arriving this time?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Just one. But since Giles has the coven searching for other slayers-in-waiting 
    to send 'em our way, I bet we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (moves the arm that was propping her head, flips her long brown hair, and 
    snuggles her face into her pillow, still looking at Willow) So, you're saying 
    I should enjoy having this bed all to myself as long as I can?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    It is starting to get crowded around here.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (props her head on her hand again) Totally. And with this many girls, well, 
    I'm just saying if we don't get another bathroom in this house soon, things 
    are gonna get ugly.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Sounds like somebody had to share mirror time with a bunch of siblings.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Somebody not me. I only got a half-sister and we didn't have to share. Her 
    bedroom was in another wing of the house.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (staring) Wing? Your house had wings?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Yeah. Just a couple. A few. Our summer home in the Hamptons didn't have any 
    at all. Well, one, actually.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Huh. Well, that's—that's ... huh.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    But never mind my deal. What's your story, Willow, I mean, witchcraft? Wow, 
    that sounds new-agey.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    No, it's safe to say that what I practice is definitely old-agey.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (nods) So, show me a trick.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    A trick?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    You know, pull a rabbit out of something, or make something float.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Uh, yeah, listen, Kennedy, um, it's almost morning. We really need to get 
    some sleep.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Hey, if I wanted to sleep, I'd be downstairs catching Z's with the other girls.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>12     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Molly's sitting on a chair, talking to three slayers-in-training, who are 
    all lined up on the floor in front of her lying in sleeping bags on their 
    bellies, heads propped up on their elbows, looking intently at her. There's 
    a brunette Hispanic girl, a blonde girl with a southern accent, and a tall, 
    skinny red-head girl.</b></p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    Annabelle was all, "Control your fear, control your fear." Meanwhile, 
    she's the one that goes scampering off, right into that Turok-Han vampire. 
    Poor Annie.</p>
<p><b>BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING</b><br/>
    Great, so the slayer who's supposed to protect us let her get killed?</p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    She didn't let her. Annabelle was foolish. Buffy can't be faulted by arriving 
    too late.</p>
<p><b>BRUNETTE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING</b><br/>
    (sits up) It's not like she could've stopped it. I mean the super vampire 
    messed her up pretty good.</p>
<p><b>RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING</b><br/>
    (sits up) No lie, she still looked like a big bruise when I got here, and 
    that was already like the day after.</p>
<p><b>BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING</b><br/>
    And why isn't she back yet? Buffy. She left to get the new girl over an hour 
    ago. (Molly looks down contemplatively) Mabye she ran into trouble. (the red-head 
    slayer-in-training shrugs) You don't think she was too late again.</p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    Maybe—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (sleeping on a couch in the background) Maybe we can save the maybes for a 
    more dayish part of the day, girls. (turns on lamp) Potential slayers can 
    function without sleep. Me, I'm no good without my usual 90 minutes.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (in the next room over, still tied to a chair, facing away from the group) 
    I'm with him. Keep the chatter down! Or, speak up so I can hear you. (to himself) 
    I'm bored. <u>Episode I</u> bored.</p>
<p><i>Buffy walks in the front door with Rona.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You guys are all still up?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (sits up, fakes a smile) Ah! Who needs sleep?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Everybody, this is Rona. (gestures to Rona)</p>
<p><b>EVERYONE</b><br/>
    Hi. Hi, Rona.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Hey, Rona.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (leans forward and smiles) Hey, Rona.</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (with her arms crossed, surveys the room, sees Andrew) Um... (to Buffy) why 
    is that guy tied to a chair?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    The question you'll soon be asking is, "Why isn't he gagged?" (smirks) 
  </p>
<p><i>Anya enters the room with a rolled up sleeping bag, and Giles follows 
    her in.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Molly, why don't you show our new houseguest where the kitchen is. I'm sure 
    she's hungry after her travels.</p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    (holding a bag of potato chips, stands) Fair enough. I'm a bit peckish meself. 
    (exits)</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (to Anya) Bit what as well?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    That's English for "hungry." (unrolls the sleeping bag and arranges 
    it on the floor)</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (follows Molly, to herself) Oh, here I thought "hungry" was English 
    for "hungry."</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (to Buffy) Everything all right?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (helping Anya make a bed for Rona) She had a welcoming committee.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    So, The First knows potential slayers are making their way here?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (leans forward on the back of a chair) I must warn the coven to be cautious.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    The First's always gonna be one step ahead of us, Giles. I need to know how 
    to stop it. No, not stop it, hurt it. I want to hurt it real bad. Tell me 
    how.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    I—I don't know, Buffy. (takes off glasses, squats down to be on eye level 
    with everyone in the room) I've exhausted all the sources I have left with 
    little result. The Watcher's records are still really all we have to go on.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    I made the rounds myself. Tried to dig up anything useful from the demon community.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    They're a community now? What's next, the Ladies' Auxiliary?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    The ones that didn't attack me, didn't know anything or didn't talk. Either 
    way, we've got squat.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Well, squat's not gonna cut it. What about the Turok-Han?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    The vampire time forgot?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Time may have forgotten him, but I sure won't. We know stakes don't kill it, 
    but anything in those ancient books about what does? Sunlight, fire, germs?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (from the other room) So, Giles, with that thing guarding the entrance to 
    The First's crib, how will Buffy get to Spike? (Giles's jaw drops, and he 
    seems perplexed)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I really hate to admit this, but he's not wrong. There's no way we'll be able 
    to help Spike until that thing is out of the way. </p>
<p><b>BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING</b><br/>
    Spike? Sorry, I'm confused. He's that vampire who's been killing people, right? 
    He's the one you're worried about helping?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (stammering) Well, we need him to—he's the one that's been—it's 
    complicated, Chloe.</p>
<p><b>BRUNETTE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / CHLOE</b><br/>
    I'm Chloe, she's Eve.</p>
<p><b>BLONDE SLAYER-IN-TRAINING / EVE</b><br/>
    It's just, well, we've been talking, and do we have some kind of plan? You 
    know, any kind of plan to keep us from dying?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (stands, sighs) We're working on it.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (stands, walks to Buffy) There is one avenue that we haven't tried yet—</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (stands) Giles!</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Beljoxa's Eye.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    And exactly what part of town is that avenue in?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (emphatically) I told you no.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Wh-what is Botox's eye?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Beljoxa's Eye. It's an oracle type creature that exists in a dark dimension.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Internal vortex more like.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Fun.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Not really, no.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    The point is, only demons can open the gateway to it. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (to Giles) Excuse me, ex-demon here.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    You're still friends in the fold. Murderous acquaintances, anyway. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (to Buffy) Look, there's no reason to think this Beljoxa's Eye will have any 
    of the answers we're looking for.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I'll take anything I can get. Anya, please, we're running out of time. Spike's 
    running out of time.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>13     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - DAY<br/>
    Spike, still beaten and scarred from his torture by The First, has his back 
    to the rocky surface of the cave. From the close up shot, it looks as though 
    he's lying on the ground with his hands on either side of his head. Pan out 
    and rotate the angle to show that he is indeed chained upright to the rocky 
    cave wall, his wrists shackled. </b></p>
<p><i>A Bringer comes toward Spike with a knife in hand. As the Bringer lunges 
    at Spike with the knife, Spike shifts his body weight from his feet to his 
    hands, as he lifts his legs up and uses his feet to break the neck of the 
    Bringer. Spike seems strong and energetic compared to when last he appeared. 
    Another Bringer approaches him, wielding a fiery torch, and Spike rips his 
    hands free of his shackles, ducking the torch as the Bringer swings it at 
    him. Spike kicks the Bringer, knocking him out, then starts to run out of 
    the cave. As he gets halfway through the passageway, he sees someone ahead, 
    walking toward him. He considers going back, but pauses to see who it is. 
    It's Buffy—white-shirted, sweetly smiling Buffy. Spike smiles and leans 
    forward—</i></p>

    still shackled to the cave wall.</i></p>

    (pacing in front of him) Dreaming of me again, aren't you? Poor Spike. He 
    still thinks I believe in him. Be realistic. I don't even believe in myself. 
    (stops pacing) At least not enough to risk my skin to save your ass. Not enough 
    to face...(turns to the Turok-Han) that. (turns back to Spike) I'm sorry, 
    Spike. But you need to accept this. You know it never would've worked out. 
    You need to let go so we can both move on. I promise, soon it'll all be—

    demon face. He's built like a biker, with a large, muscular body, and long 
    stringy hair. But his hairline is unusual—a long zigzag pattern along 
    the crown of his head. He's also got a barbed wire tattoo over his ear where 
    there's no hair. His eyes are an odd color, and his face is red and creased 
    like he's been scarred from fights, his ears are oversized and pointed. He's 
    pierced everywhere—nose, brow, ears. Plus, he's got a goatee and a few

    Don't mock this. The night we spent together was...important to me. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    It was one date. And it wasn't even a date. (Giles rolls his eyes) We just 
    happened to be invited to the same massacre, and—and you hit on me after

    a crunching sound. He squeezes his fist, then flings blood from his wounded 
    hand toward the back of the alley. A moment later, a portal appears, glowing

    the basement. There's equipment there for them to use, and ample space for 
    working out. The redheaded girl is stretching. Molly is juggling stakes. Kennedy 
    is holding the punching bag for Chloe. Rona and Eve are standing on the sidelines 
    watching them.</b></p>
<p><b>EVE</b><br/>
    (shrugs) What—what are we all doing here?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    It's called training. Didn't your watcher ever teach you the word?</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    I never had a watcher. I only just found out what I was—or what I might 
    be—after those crazy-ass monks came after me.</p>
<p><b>EVE</b><br/>
    I meant why are we all bothering? It's not like we can make a difference. 
    (Kennedy rolls her eyes)</p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    We've gotta try. (juggling stakes) We gotta keep our reflexes sharp. (drops 
    a stake)</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    We have to be ready. If something comes down—</p>
<p><b>CHLOE</b><br/>
    No, something's already come down.</p>
<p><b>EVE</b><br/>
    She's right. And what are we supposed to do about it? I mean, I've never seen 
    a real vampire in my whole life, much less slayed one.</p>
<p><b>RED-HEAD SLAYER-IN-TRAINING</b><br/>
    I've seen one. (the girls turn to look at her) Well, my watcher once showed 
    me a photograph of one. (beat) A blurry photograph.</p>
<p><b>EVE</b><br/>
    (gestures toward her) That's what I'm saying. Not one of us is remotely prepared 
    to be activated as a new chosen one.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    Excuse the newness of me, but, uh, just so I understand, if a slayer dies—</p>

    the next slayer, with the weight of the world on her shoulders.</p>

    (shakes her head) It won't be me. I mean, not now. I mean, I'm too young.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Doesn't work that way. In fact, the younger, the better. In fact, I'm starting 
    to think it might be too late for me.</p>
<p><b>EVE</b><br/>
    Never too late. It could be anyone. Especially since there's so few of us 
    left. They'll just run through each one of us, one after the other. Kinda 
    creepy, huh? All we do is wait around for each other to die.</p>

    Hey! (the girls stop talking) Look, I know you're all scared. You know what? 
    I am too, but Giles and Anya will be back soon, and hopefully they will have 
    the information that we need to stop The First. In the mean time, we need 
    to stick together. OK, we're stronger that way. We cannot afford to fall apart

    See? Dust. Just like the rest of 'em. I don't know what's coming next, but 
    I do know it's gonna be just like this. Hard. Painful. But in the end it's 
    gonna be us. If we all do our parts, believe it, we'll be the ones left standing. 
    Here endeth the lesson.</p>
<p><i>Buffy walks away as the slayers-in-training watch her. Kennedy smiles; 
    the other girls look at each other. They all follow Buffy out of the construction 
    site. Pan back to show Eve/First standing on the scaffolding, scowling and

    CAVE - NIGHT<br/>
    Still shackled to the rocky cave wall, Spike sees someone walking toward him.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

    her and realizes she's real, he smiles and squints, searching her face intently. 
    She looks into his eyes, tapping an emotional connection between them.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    You. Oh. </p>
<p><i>He puts his arm over her shoulder, and she puts her arm around his waist. 
    Although Spike is weak and limping, they walk out of the cave together. </i></p>
