  They're all slayers?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them 
  all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on

    Still shackled to the rocky cave wall, Spike sees someone walking toward him.

    forward and braces himself with his hand on her shoulder. When he touches 
    her and realizes she's real, he smiles and squints, searching her face intently. 
    She looks into his eyes, tapping an emotional connection between them.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY (V.O.)</b><br/>

    in a very elegant, romantic restaurant.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  How? How do you know about slayers?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  My mother was one. She was killed when I was four. </p>

  A vampire. </p>

<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy's walking around the house, checking on the slayers-in-training as they 
    sleep—the floor is crowded with them in their sleeping bags. Buffy bends 
    down to pick up a large, thick book labeled "Greek," and she puts 
    it on the desk before turning out the light. </b></p>

    Buffy goes upstairs to check on more potentials in Willow's room. Kennedy's 
    sleeping in the bed with Willow, and several more girls are in sleeping bags 
    on the floor. Buffy hears crying from the hallway, and goes to investigate. 
    In the corner at the end of the hall, Chloe is sitting on the floor, huddled 
    up with her knees to her chest, sobbing.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Chloe? It is Chloe, right?</p>
<p><i>Chloe looks up at Buffy, but before she can answer, the First Slayer tackles 
    Buffy from the side, pushing her down the stairs. The First Slayer lands on 
    top of Buffy.</i></p>

<p><b>21     EXT.     ALLEY 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT<br/>
    Anya and Spike are walking together down an alley side by side.</b></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I'm a bright girl, good education, quick on the uptake. So, tell me, why in 
  the name of almighty Grothnar would I let myself become human again?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  You're really talking to the wrong fella.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I mean, sure, the vengeance demon gig has some downsides...</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  All jobs do.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  But being human? Ugh! You're always icky on the inside, disgusting on the outside.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (stops, turns to look at her) Your outside's not so bad.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (blushes) You know, the only thing worse than being human is being trapped inside 
  a house full of humans.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Preaching to the choir, luv.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I mean, it's like we live in slayer central. I swear, if Buffy rooms or boards 
  one more of the potential girls, I'm gonna call a—I'm gonna call a health inspector.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I like my plan better. Get up, get out, get drunk. Repeat as needed. It's just 
  more elegant. (starts walking again)</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (puts her arm through his) Thanks for having me along.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (looks at Anya's arm through his) Don't mention it.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  At first, I thought... it's weird. Is Spike asking me out on a date? 'Cause 
  that would just be...(unlaces her arm from his) nuts. (laughs nervously) </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Right. I'm just out for the alcohol.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Right there with you, scooter. (puts her hands in her pockets) Tonight, I plan 
  to drink you under the table.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  You're on, then.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Good. (shrugs) Of course, once you're down there, I could join you. Kidding. 
  I like my sex on top of the table.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (looks up to the sky) Would you let it go? You're like a dog with a bone!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  So what?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  It's my bone. Just drop it.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  OK. OK. I wasn't proposing. Time goes by, girl gets hungry. You should know.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (rolls his eyes) Oh, thank God.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  What?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Demon.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (with a demon standing behind her) Huh?</p>
<p><b>DEMON</b><br/>
  (pushing Anya to the ground) D'Hoffryn says you die.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Of course he does.</p>
<p><i>Spike kicks the demon between the legs, causing it to double over. Then 
    Spike punches it in the head, knocking the demon to the ground. Spike looks 
    at Anya, then back at the demon, and decides to flee the scene. He grabs Anya 
    by the arm, pulling her hastily to her feet.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Oh, hey!</p>
<p><i>Spike and Anya run down the alley, away from the demon.</i></p>

    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Buffy's sitting at her desk, and Principal Wood's standing behind her with 
    his arms crossed. They are both facing the same direction.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  This may mean more than you think.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Is that so? </p>
<p><i>Show that Principal Wood and Buffy are talking to two young boys who have 
    bruises and ripped shirts.</i></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Because I think what we have here is a couple of chuckle-heads who thought that 
  a cafeteria fist fight would impress. I'm not impressed. Buffy, are you impressed? 
  (Buffy purses her lips and shakes her head disapprovingly) Still, I'm gonna 
  cut you guys some slack this time. (makes a gesture toward the door with his 
  thumb; the kids leave; to Buffy) Third fight this week, and it's just getting 
  worse. (closes window blinds, walks to the front of Buffy's desk) Plus, a rise 
  in vandalism. Three students missing. Tell me something, Buffy, in your professional 
  opinion— (listens to the kids rough-housing in the hallway outside) it's started, 
  hasn't it? (closes another set of window blinds)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  The hellmouth has begun its semi-annual percolation. Usually, it blows around 
  May.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Was it like this before? I mean, it just seems to me as if things are getting 
  bad faster than we thought.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  We're a little ahead of schedule.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  I can't say I'm too surprised. I knew I signed on for something, but, Buffy, 
  I'm just a guy. Granted, a cool and sexy vampire-fighting guy, but still.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (smiles) Don't forget "snappy dresser."</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  (smiles) Mm. Thank you. But this is gonna get bigger than me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  That's why I've decided to give you this.</p>
<p><i>Principal Wood reaches down under Buffy's desk and pulls up a large leather 
    duffel bag, setting it on her desk with a clunk.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  What is it?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  An emergency kit. This bag belonged to my mother.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  A slayer keepsake. I-I couldn't.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Well, you have to. Technically, it should have been passed down directly to 
  you through the years, but after my mother died... I guess I just couldn't part 
  with it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Wow!</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  I don't know what's inside, exactly, but I know it has something to do with 
  her power. Well, your power now.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I-I don't know what to say.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Try saying, "Thank you, Principal Wood."</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Thank you, Principal Wood.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  (grins) Ah, call me Robin. Now, I'd like to see where you work.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Uh, here, actually. (touches her desk) Uh, th-this is my desk, and, uh, (holds 
  up her pencil holder) these are my pencils...</p>

  No, where you do your other work.</p>

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Buffy and Principal Wood walk through the front door to Buffy's house.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  So, all the potential slayers—who seem to keep popping up from, like, every 
  corner of the earth— (shuts the door) were getting killed.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  By the First.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Agents of. We thought the Council could protect them, but, unfortunately, no 
  one was protecting the Council, and all their watchers were killed. Word got 
  out, and they've all been coming here since.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Well, there's nothing like the end of the world to bring people together. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It's heartwarming. Anyway, this is, uh, it. Command central.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  (storms into the room wearing a white apron and a red and white checked oven 
  mitt on each hand) Where the hell have you been? (crosses arms) This funnel 
  cake is kicking my ass.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Yeah, I hear they're tricky.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Robin Wood, this is...Andrew.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  (offers his hand) It's a pleasure. (shakes hands with Andrew)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Andrew is our—actually, he's our hostage.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  I like to think of myself more as a (makes quote marks in the air with his mitted 
  hands) "guestage."</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  (to Buffy) So, you—you hold him here against his will?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Well, he was evil, and people got killed, and now he...bakes. It's a thing.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Oh.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Could we try to just keep our secret headquarters a little bit secret? Keep 
  bringing people in, they're gonna see everything. They'll see the big board.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Andrew, we don't have a big board.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  (runs to fetch a white dry-erase board from behind the chair) I, uh, made it 
  myself.</p>
<p><i>The board is approximately 2' x 4', and is labeled: SUNNYDALE "BIG 
    BOARD". Using every color of marker, the board features a hand-drawn 
    map of Sunnydale, with representations of trees, cemeteries, railroad tracks, 
    and the street grid.</i></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Oh, I wouldn't have guessed.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  (pointing to the board) Uh, this is us. And this represents the First in various 
  incarnations. And, uh, there's no pattern to the naked eye yet, but the instant 
  one emerges, yours truly is on it. (Buffy and Wood look at each other, then 
  walk away; Andrew calls after them) Where do we put our receipts?</p>

  for us than just the, uh, big board.</p>

  So, I see.</p>

  Chamber your energy. Punch block combo! (Chloe does the moves incorrectly, and 
  Kennedy notices, walking up to her) Hold it! What the hell do you call that,

  (in her face) Push-ups, maggot! (Chloe drops to do push-ups; Kennedy turns toward 
  Buffy and Wood, still scowling, then suddenly grinning and giddy) I love this 
  job! Did you see that? I called that girl "maggot." (to Wood) Hi. 
  (hands on her hips again) Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  An ally.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  So, what do you think? My girls ready to kick some ass, or what?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Looking strong.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  But...?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Well, I'm just not sure the First has an ass that you can actually, you know, 
  kick.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  (smirks) Guess we'll see.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
  (waving) Principal Wood, hi! It's so weird seeing you outside of school.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  (to Amanda) What are you waving at, potential? Attention!</p>
<p><b>POTENTIALS</b><br/>
  Huh!</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  Rising sun. Begin. (they continue their training as Buffy and Wood talk)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You're right, it's not enough.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  That's not what I said, Buffy. It's an impressive group of recruits.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  They're not recruits. Recruits are...recruited. These girls were chosen. </p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  You're doing the best you can with what you've got.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  They're not all gonna make it. Some will die, and nothing I can do will stop 
  that.</p>
<p><i>Willow walks out the back door onto the porch, arms full of weapons. She 
    freezes when she sees Principal Wood.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Oh, hi. Hey. Well, Buffy, I—I see that our preparation for the school-pep-dance-cheer-drill 
  contest are coming along. (to the potentials) Bring it on!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It's OK, I filled him in on everything.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (lets out a sigh of relief) Oh, thank God! If I had to explain all these weapons, 
  I had nothing. (puts down the weapons) </p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Buffy tells me you have been, um—oh, how shall I put it—experimenting. (Willow's 
  eyes grow wide; she casts a "you said what?" glance at Buffy) With 
  the magicks.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (laughs nervously) Oh! Yeah. Oh, nothing too heavy, though. Just the lighter, 
  safer stuff. Uh, if Kennedy asks, her pointy stuff's right there. See you inside. 
  (to Buffy) So much cooler than Snyder.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  She really almost destroyed the world?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (nods) Yep.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Remind me not to make her crabby.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It might be better if you did.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  How's that work?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Oh, I don't know. It's just—the First is coming, and then look at us: the army. 
  We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a Wicca who won't-a, and the 
  brains of our operation wears oven mitts.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Hm. Well, you're redefining the job, Buffy, and that takes guts. This isn't

<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Anya, think. I fight, demon boy gets lucky, I get knocked out, you get killed. 
  True? (Anya thinks, starts to speak, rolls her eyes) We both know the safest 
  and sanest way of saving your life was to keep you with me, away from danger. 
  (Anya grunts, shakes her head and walks away) No need to thank me. I'm just 
  the one who beat him off. (looks at Buffy) Repelled him would perhaps be the 
  better phrase. (Buffy nods) Demon.</p>

  Not a bit. And just what brings our good principal to this neck of the gloom?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I'm showing him our operation. Us.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  (still not facing Spike) Is that what you are? A good guy?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (turns from Buffy toward Wood) I haven't heard any complaints. Well, I have 
  heard a few complaints over the years, but then I just killed whoever spoke 
  up, and that was pretty much that. (Woods turns to face Spike)</p>

<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Not much to tell. I've changed.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Oh, now that you have a soul. (nods) </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Yeah. That was a big deal. Very... private. (hurt, to Buffy) What, are you just 
  telling everyone now?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
  Oh, come on, Spike. Don't blame Buffy. I asked. (walks toward Spike) </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (walks toward Wood) Right, the educator. (facing each other now, only a few 
  feet apart) Yeah, I went to great lengths. Lots of trouble, and now I'm unique. 
  Well, more or less. Got myself a soul, whatever that means.</p>

  Trinkets, weapons, one very large textbook. (picks up the book, flips through 
  it) Translation's gonna be a bitch, but... Do you know that ancient Sumerians

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (scoffs) They're worse than the French. Anything else?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Uh, yeah. A box. A big, fat, unopenable box. I'm betting whatever the big deal 
  about this emergency bag is, you'll find it in the box. (puts the book down)</p>

  Dawn, get a knife. We're cutting her down.</p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You're not Chloe.</p>
<p><b>CHLOE/FIRST</b><br/>

  Nothing! We just talked all night. Well, I did most of the talking, but Chloe

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Don't listen to it, any of you. It's the First.</p>
<p><b>CHLOE/FIRST</b><br/>
  Oh, let 'em. The only reason why Chloe offed herself is 'cause she knew what

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Anyone want to say a few words about Chloe? (silence) Let me. (paces) Chloe 
  was an idiot. Chloe was stupid. She was weak. And anyone in a rush to be the 
  next dead body I bury, it's easy. Just...think of Chloe, and do what she did. 
  And I'll find room for you next to her and Annabelle. I'm the slayer. The one 
  with the power. And the First has me using that power to dig our graves. (throws 
  down the shovel angrily) I've been carrying you—all of you—too far, too long.

  You're new here, and you're wrong. Because I use the power that I have. The 
  rest of you are just waiting for me.</p>

  I'm not.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I provide much-needed... sarcasm.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

  The First isn't impressed. It already knows us. It knows what we can do, and 
  it's laughing. You want to surprise the enemy? Surprise yourselves. Force yourself 
  to do what can't be done, or else we are not an army—we're just a bunch of 
  girls waiting to be picked off and buried. (Spike stands and walks toward the 
  door) Where are you going?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Out. Since I'm neither a girl, nor waiting. All this speechifying doesn't really 
  apply to me, does it? (walks away)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (calls after him) Fine. Take a cell phone. That way, if I need someone to get 
  weepy or whaled on, I can call you.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (turns to Buffy) If you've got something to say—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Just said it. You keep holding back, you might as well walk out that door.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Holding back? You're blind. I've been here, right in it—fighting, scrapping...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Since you got your soul back?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Well, as a matter of fact, I haven't quite been relishing the kill the way I 
  used to.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You were a better fighter then.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I did this for you. The soul, the changes—it's what you wanted.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  What I want is the Spike that's dangerous. The Spike that tried to kill me when 
  we met.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (angrily) Oh, you don't know how close you are to bringing him out. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  advanced reading assignments. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Yeah, cool stuff, but we've seen it all before.</p>

  Mm, I don't know. It hasn't been opened since— (Buffy breaks off the lock with 
  her bare hands) Well, since now.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (pulls out metal figures from the bag) Puppets. That's it! The First hates puppets! 
  Now if we can just airlift Kermit, Fozzie the Bear, and Miss Piggy into town, 
  the First'll be a-running. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Those are Muppets.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (takes the figure from Xander) And these things are shadow-casters. You put 
  them in motion, and they tell you a story. (references the book) It says you 
  can't just watch, you have to see.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  What the hell does that mean?</p>

  It's cryptic. I don't like it. Every time instructions get cryptic, someone

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Uh, conservation of energies. You can't really create or destroy anything, only 
  transfer.</p>

  I'm sorry, are you helping?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  No, but at least I'm not galloping off in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Magic works off physics.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>

  some kind of conduit.</p>

<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
