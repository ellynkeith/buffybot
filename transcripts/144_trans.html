<h3><b>RECAP: (<a href="#beginning">Skip Recap...</a>)</b></h3>
<p><b>GILES (V.O.)</b><br/>
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:</p>
<p><b>1     INT.     CHAPEL 
    AT CEMETERY - NIGHT<br/>
    There is a large, simple, gothic crucifix at the front of the chapel that 
    can be seen by looking directly down the central aisle. Spike embraces the 
    crucifix, resting one arm over each side of the cross bar, and resting his 
    head in the corner of the vertex. His body is sizzling and smoke is rising 
    from where it touches the cross. A close-up of Buffy's face shows that she 
    is crying now. From where she stands, Spike's exhausted body hanging limply 
    on the cross resembles Jesus (except the view is of Spike's back). </b></p>

<p><b>2     INT.     STRANGER'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy is sitting on the edge of the bed. Spike is in front of her.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (kneels in front of her; looks into her eyes) And there's only one thing I've 
    ever been sure of: you. </p>
<p>Spike sits on the bed beside Buffy and puts his arm around her. She curls 
    up on him, cuddling up to his chest as he puts his arm around her shoulder, 
    holding her head with his hand.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE (V.O.)</b><br/>
    You're the one, Buffy.</p>

    Xander is driving, and Dawn is unconscious in the seat beside him. She breathes

    (looks around) Where are we going?</p>
<p><i>Xander hands Dawn a letter. Dawn opens the letter and starts reading.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY (V.O.)</b><br/>
    Dearest Dawn, don't be angry with Xander. This isn't the place for either 
    of you.—</p>
<p><i>Without letting Xander see it, Dawn puts a stun gun up to Xander's neck 
    and presses the button, zapping Xander and knocking him out. </i></p>

<p><b>6     INT.     PYRAMIDAL 
    TOMB - NIGHT<br/>

    Buffy walks down into the tomb. It's lit inside, although dimly, by torches, 
    giving it an orange hue. Buffy looks around cautiously. Buffy sees a very 
    old woman with long white hair standing before her.</b></p>
<p><b>WOMAN</b><br/>
    (admires the scythe) A scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Does this mean I can win?</p>
<p><i>The woman's head cocks slightly to the side, and a cracking noise can 
    be heard. The woman falls to the ground. Buffy looks up and sees Caleb standing 
    there. Caleb picks up the scythe.</i></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    I was kind of hoping it'd go this way. (rears back with the scythe)</p>
<p><b>MAN (O.S.)</b><br/>
    Hey! (punches Caleb, knocking him down)</p>
<p><i>Buffy looks up to see that it's Angel standing there having knocked Caleb 
    down. Buffy swings the scythe at Caleb, slicing his stomach. He stumbles back, 
    laughs heartily, wags his finger at her, and falls to the floor.</i></p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>

    At least you could tell me you're glad to see me. (walks toward Buffy)</p>
<p><i>Buffy drops the scythe to the floor and walks up to Angel, pressing herself 
    against his body and kisses him deeply on the lips. </i></p>
<p><i>Pan over to show Spike is in the tomb as well, hiding behind the pillar, 
    watching them. Buffy/First is beside him, whispering in his ear.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    That bitch.</p>

<h3><b>PROLOGUE:</b></h3>
<p><b>7     INT.     PYRAMIDAL 
    TOMB - NIGHT<br/>

    Resume. Angel and Buffy are kissing inside the tomb as Spike looks on from 
    the shadows.</b></p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    (pulls back from the kiss) Well, I guess that qualifies as "happy to 
    see me."</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (looks into Angel's eyes, smiling) Angel, what are you doing— (shakes 
    her head) Don't even. I just want to bask. (looks into Angel's eyes, smiling, 
    for a few seconds, then snaps out of it) OK, I'm basked. What are you doing 
    here?</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Not saving the damsel in distress, that's for sure.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Oh, you know me. (picks up scythe) Not much with the damseling.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Got your share of distress, though. (walks to the wall) </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You heard?</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    (picks up a file folder from a bench by the wall) I got coverage on the whole 
    thing. It's very gripping. It needs a third act.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (shakes her head at him) You have to leave L.A. </p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    It's the First, right? The First evil. The power that tried to convince me 
    to kill myself.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Yeah. It's gotten a little more ambitious since then. It's raising an army.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Yeah, well, it failed once, and I'm here to tell you—</p>
<p><i>Caleb stands up behind Angel and knocks Angel down by hitting him with 
    a cat statue, sending him across the floor. Caleb walks up to Buffy, black 
    blood streaming from his eyes and nose.</i></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Are you ready to finish this, bitch?!</p>

<p><b>Opening Credits.</b></p>
<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>8     INT.     PYRAMIDAL 
    TOMB - NIGHT<br/>
    Resume. Caleb, who's still holding his cat statue, has just confronted Buffy 
    in the tomb after having knocked Angel out.</b></p>
<p><i>Caleb swings the cat statue at Buffy, but she blocks with the scythe and 
    then falls to the ground. She swings at him with the scythe, but he blocks 
    with the cat statue. Caleb knocks Buffy to the ground, then throws the cat 
    statue at Buffy. Buffy stands, holding the scythe.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (breathing hard) OK...how many times do I have to kill you? Ballpark figure.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    You understand nothing.</p>
<p><i>Buffy swings at Caleb, but he grabs the scythe, holding it still, and 
    punches Buffy in the face twice. He lifts Buffy in the air, pressing her back 
    against the low ceiling. Buffy struggles, and Caleb finally lets her fall 
    to the floor. He walks up to her slowly, then picks her up by her lapels.</i></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    (through gritted teeth) You think you have power over me?</p>
<p><i>Buffy breaks free of his grip and kicks him, knocking him down to the 
    floor. </i> </p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Stupid girl. (stands) You'll never stop me. You don't have the ba—</p>
<p><i>While Caleb gets to his feet, Buffy twirls the scythe and swings it up 
    between his legs. Caleb's eyes go wide.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Who does nowadays?</p>
<p><i>Caleb looks down incredulously at the scythe lodged in his body between 
    his legs. Buffy swiftly pushes the scythe up through his body.</i></p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    (lying on the floor, regains consciousness and stands, angrily) OK, now I'm 
    pissed. Where is he?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (looks to her right, then to her left, then at Angel) He had to split. (giggles 
    devilishly)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    (whispering to Spike, who's still watching Buffy from the shadows) Yeah, she 
    needs you real bad.</p>
<p><i>Angel picks up the folder again and brings it to Buffy. </i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I'll have the guys go through that. See if there's anything new. Reliable 
    source?</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Not remotely.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    Mm, any port in an apocalypse.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    I, uh, brought something else as well.</p>
<p><i>Angel takes an amulet out of his pocket and holds it up for Buffy to see. 
    It's a 2-inch diameter round crystal pendant in a silver starburst setting 
    hung from a coarse silver chain.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (shakes her head) I can already tell you, I have nothing that goes with that.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    It's not for you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Splainy?</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    I don't know everything. It's very powerful and probably very dangerous. It 
    has a purifying power, a cleansing power, possibly scrubbing bubbles. The 
    translation is, uh—anyway, it bestows strength to the right person who 
    wears it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    And the right person is?</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Someone ensouled, but stronger than human. A champion. As in me. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Or me.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    No. I don't know nearly enough about this to risk you wearing it. Besides, 
    you got that real cool axe-thing going for you.</p>
<p><i>Spike walks out the back without being noticed.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    So you're gonna be with me in this.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>

    Shoulder to shoulder. I'm yours.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    No, what?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    No. You're not gonna be in this fight. (walks away)</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    (cuts her off) Why the hell not?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    'Cause I can't risk you.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>

    You need me in this.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, I need you gone. </p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Why?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    If I lose, if this thing gets past Sunnydale, then it's days—maybe hours—before 
    the rest of the world goes. I need a second front, and I need you to run it.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    OK... (crosses his arms) that's one reason. What's the other?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (walks out of the tomb) There is no other.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>9     EXT.     PYRAMIDAL 
    TOMB - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy walks out of the tomb. Angel follows her.</b></p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Is it Spike? (Buffy stops walking, turns to face Angel) You're not telling 
    me something. And his scent, I remember it pretty well.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You vampires. Did anybody ever tell you the whole smelling people thing's 
    a little gross? (walks away)</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    (follows) Is he your boyfriend?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Is that your business?</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    You in love with him? OK, maybe I'm outta line, but this is kind of a curve 
    ball for me. I mean, we are talking about Spike here.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It's different. He's different. He has a soul now.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    (stops) Oh. (looks up) Well.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What?</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    That's great. (mumbling to himself) Everyone's got a soul now.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    He'll make a difference.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    (mumbling) You know, I started it. The whole having a soul. Before it was 
    all the cool new thing.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Oh, my God. Are you 12?</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    I'm getting the brush off for Captain Peroxide. It doesn't necessarily bring 
    out the champion in me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You're not getting the brush off. Are you just gonna come here and go all 
    Dawson on me every time I have a boyfriend?</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Aha! (points) Boyfriend!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    He's not. But...he is in my heart.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    That'll end well. (walks away, leans on a tombstone)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What was the highlight of our relationship? When you broke up with me or when 
    I killed you? I'm well aware of my stellar history with guys... (sighs, leans 
    beside Angel) And, no, I don't see fat grandchildren in the offing with Spike, 
    but I don't think that really matters right now. (chuckles) You know, in the 
    midst of all this insanity, a couple things are actually starting to make 
    sense. And the guy thing— (sighs) I always feared there was something 
    wrong with me, you know, because I couldn't make it work. But maybe I'm not 
    supposed to. </p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>

    Because you're the slayer?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (looks at Angel) Because—OK, I'm cookie dough. I'm not done baking. I'm 
    not finished becoming whoever the hell it is I'm gonna turn out to be. I make 
    it through this, and the next thing, and the next thing, and maybe one day 
    I turn around and realize I'm ready. I'm cookies. And then, you know, if I 
    want someone to eat— (eyes go wide as she catches herself) or enjoy warm, 
    delicious cookie me, then...that's fine. That'll be then. When I'm done.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Any thoughts on who might enjoy— (sighs, irritated) Do I have to go with 
    the cookie analogy?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I'm not really thinking that far ahead. That's kind of the point.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    (hands the amulet to Buffy) I'll go start working on the second front. Make 
    sure I don't have to use it. (walks away)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (calls after him) Angel. (he turns to look at her) I do... sometimes think 
    that far ahead.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    Sometimes is something. (smiles, walks away)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Be a long time coming. Years, if ever.</p>
<p><b>ANGEL</b><br/>
    (shrugs) I ain't getting any older. (walks away)</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>10     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Dawn is waiting by the front door when Buffy walks in. Buffy's surprised to 
    see her. Dawn kicks Buffy in the shin.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Ow.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Dumbass.</p>
<p><i>Buffy looks over at Xander, who's in the dining room with Anya, Giles, 
    and Willow.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Don't look at me. This is a Summers' thing. It's all very violent.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    (looks at Dawn) If you get killed, I'm telling. (walks into the dining room; 
    Dawn follows)</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Did you find out anything about the scythe?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It slices, dices, and makes julienne preacher. </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

    Caleb?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I cut him in half.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    All right!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>

    He had that coming.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Hey, party in my eye socket and everyone's invited. (everyone stares at Xander) 
    Sometimes I shouldn't say words.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>11     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>

    Spike is in the basement punching a punching bag when Buffy walks down the 
    stairs.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    So...where's tall, dark and forehead?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (rolls her eyes) Let me guess. You can smell him.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

    Yeah, that and I also used my enhanced vampire eyeballs to watch you kissing 
    him.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (awkwardly) It was...a hello.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Most people don't use their tongues to say hello. Or I guess they do, but—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    There were no tongues. Besides, he's gone.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Oh, just popped by for a quickie, then?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (walks away) Good, good. I haven't had quite enough jealous vampire crap for 
    one night.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

    He wears lifts, you know.</p>
<p><i>Buffy looks over at the punching bag that Spike was hitting and sees something 
    has been taped to it: a sketch drawn in black marker on white paper, shows 
    hair that sticks straight up, X's for eyes and fangs on the frowny face. Buffy 
    rolls her eyes at the representation of Angel.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You know, one of these days I'm just gonna put you 2 in a room and let you 
    wrestle it out.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (rifling through an empty cigarette package) No problem at this end. (throws 
    the package away in disgust)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (her eyes widen with excitement) There could be oil of some kind involved.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (walks up to Buffy) Where's the trinket?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    The who-ket?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    The pretty necklace your sweetie-bear gave you. The one with all the power. 
    I believe it's mine now.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    How do you figure?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Someone with a soul, but more than human? Angel meant to wear it, that means 
    I'm the qualified party. (holds out his hands)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It's volatile. We don't know—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    You'll be needing someone strong to bear it, then. You planning on giving 
    it to Andrew?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (looks at the amulet, then at Spike) Angel said the amulet was meant to be 
    worn by a champion. </p>
<p><i>Spike looks down, disappointed, but Buffy walks forward and hands it to 
    him.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Been called a lot of things in my time.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (coyly) Faith still has my room.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

    Well, you're not staying here. You can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet 
    talk. You got Angel breath. I'm not gonna just let you whack me back and forth 
    like a rubber ball. I've got my pride, you know.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I understand. (turns to walk away)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (cuts her off) Clearly you don't, 'cause the whole "having my pride" 
    thing was just a smokescreen.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (sighs with relief) Oh, thank God.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I don't know what I would have done if you'd have gone up those stairs.</p>
<p><i>Later, Buffy and Spike are lying together on the cot, fully clothed. Spike

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You're not him.</p>
<p><b>CALEB/FIRST</b><br/>
    No, you killed him right and proper. Terrible loss. This man was my good right 
    arm. 'Course, it don't pain me too much. Don't need an arm. Got an army.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    An army of vampires. However will I fight—</p>
<p><b>CALEB/FIRST</b><br/>
    Every day our numbers swell. But then you do have an army of your own. Some 
    thirty-odd pimply-faced girls, don't know the pointy end of a stake. (feigns 
    concern) Maybe I should call this off.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    basically powerless. How about "The Taunter?" Strikes fear in the

    I will overrun this Earth. And when my army outnumbers the humans on this 
    Earth, the scales will tip and I will be made flesh.</p>

<p><b>CALEB/FIRST</b><br/>
    (rolls eyes) Then why aren't you asleep in your dead lover's arms? (looks 
    over at Spike) 'Cause he can't help you. Nor Faith, nor your friends, certainly 
    not your wanna-slay brigade. None of those girlies will ever know real power 
    unless you're dead. You know the drill: (morphs into Buffy's form)</p>

    Into every generation, a slayer is born. One girl in all the world. She alone

    are. How you'll die. Alone. Where's your snappy comeback?</p>

    No. Yeah. I just realized something. Something that really never occurred 
    to me before. We're gonna win.</p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    So here's the part where you make a choice: What if you could have that power...now? 
    In every generation, one slayer is born... because a bunch of men who died 
    thousands of years ago made up that rule. They were powerful men. This woman 
    (points to Willow) is more powerful than all of them combined. (Willow whimpers) 
    So I say we change the rule. I say my power...</p>
