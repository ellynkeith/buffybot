<p><b>PROLOGUE</b></p>
<p><b>8     EXT.     CITY STREET IN ISTANBUL - NIGHT</b></p>
<p><b>TITLE CARD: Istanbul</b></p>
<p><b>Turkish music plays. Camera shows the city skyline and closes in on the 

  top of a building, and then to the street. A dark-haired girl is running through 

  the arched hallway, looking over her shoulder and panting from the exertion 

  of running so fast. She slips down an embankment. She's being chased. A man 

  on the street sees her through his front door, and closes it rather than help 

  her. Two people in hooded cloaks are chasing her. After trying various alleys 

  looking for an escape route, she finds herself trapped in a dead-end. She sees 

  a drain pipe next to her and decides to use it to scale the building. The people 

  chasing her grab her foot, but she manages to escape their grip and easily climbs 

  up to the roof. There, another hooded figure is waiting and pushes her off the 

  building. She screams, but she lands on the ground alive, on her back. Two hooded 

  figures hold her down, and she fights back with all her might. A third figure 

  raises an arched, shiny, silver dagger and thrusts down at her.</b></p>

  CEMETERY - NIGHT<br/>
</b><b>Camera is at ground level, showing a new vampire rising from his grave. 

  He's middle-aged, wearing a suit. Sounds of his struggle to escape his grave 

  persist until he interrupts the girls talking.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY<br/>
</b>It's about power.</p>
<p><i>Pan to Buffy talking to someone.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Who's got it. Who knows how to use it. So...</p>
<p><i>Tosses a stake to Dawn.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Who's got the power, Dawn?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  (sighs) Well, I've got the stake.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  The stake is not the power.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  But he's new. He doesn't know his strength. H-he might not know all those fancy 

  martial arts skills they inevitably seem to pick up.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Who's got the power?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  He does.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Never forget it. Doesn't matter how well prepped you are or how well armed you 

  are. You're a little girl.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  Woman.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Little woman. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  I'm taller than you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  He's a vampire, OK? Demon. Preternaturally strong. Skilled with powers no human 

  could possibly ever—</p>
<p><b>VAMPIRE</b><br/>

  Excuse me. I think I'm stuck.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  You're stuck?</p>
<p><b>VAMPIRE</b><br/>

  My foot's caught on a root or something, and... I don't even know how I got 

  down there. If you girls could just give me a hand...</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  Hm. So, he's got the power?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Zip it.</p>
<p><b>VAMPIRE</b><br/>

  I really appreciate it. It's just it's so dark, and I don't even know what I'm 

  doing here.</p>
<p><i>Buffy picks him up by his suit collar and puts him down standing on his 

  feet.</i></p>
<p><b>VAMPIRE</b><br/>

  Whoa. Ooh. Thanks. That was a help. Unfortunately it was the last—</p>
<p><i>Buffy grabs him by the throat. His voice turns scratchy.</i></p>
<p><b>VAMPIRE</b><br/>

  —thing you'll ever do.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Listen up. I'm the slayer. You don't want to get into it with me. You want blood? 

  You can have hers. </p>
<p><i>Vampire turns to go after Dawn.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Power. He's got it. He's going to use it. You don't have it, so — </p>
<p><i>Vampire is charging Dawn. She bends and flips him over her back.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  —use that. Perfect.</p>
<p><i>Dawn stakes him, and thinks she defeated him. But she missed the heart. 

  She gets a panicked look on her face. He pushes Dawn down, gets up and away 

  from her. She tries again to stake him, but he overpowers her and starts to 

  bite her neck.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  Buffy!</p>
<p><i>Buffy grabs the vampire's coat from behind, and he drops Dawn. Buffy fights 

  with swings, kicks, punches, etc. Finally, she grabs a nearby sword, and cuts 

  off his head.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  It's real. It's the only lesson, Dawn. It's always real. Let me see.</p>
<p><i>She inspects Dawn's neck. There are two puncture wounds where the vampire 

  bit her.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  It's nothing, it's just a scrape. Plus, I had a plan the whole time.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Really?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  Yeah, I planned to get killed, come back as a vampire, and bite you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  You wanted to be trained.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  Well, just the next time when you're gonna disa—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  You did pretty well.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  I did?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  'Cause, you know, with the whole rolling thing, I was actually using his strength, 

  and it was very tai chi. Plus I nearly got the heart.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  My first time out, I missed the heart too.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  No way.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Just the once.</p>
<p><i>Buffy walks back to pack up her tools and weapons. They begin walking home.</i>
</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  Well, the next vampire I meet—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  The next vampire you meet, you run away. I just wish that was all we had to 

  worry about. Vampires, demons... they're nothing compared to what's coming.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  I know. I just can't believe it's back.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Believe me, I thought I was long past it. I guess you never are. Just a few 

  more days 'til it starts. Then we'll never know what's coming next.</p>

<p><b>TITLE CARD: Westbury, England</b></p>
<p><b>Giles is riding a horse through the English countryside. Then we see him 

  walking through a field to a tree that Willow is sitting under. She is looking 

  at the ground making an exotic flower grow and bloom.</b></p>
<p><b>GILES<br/>
</b>That doesn't belong there.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  No, it doesn't.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  That's the flora kua alaya. A native of Paraguay, if my botany serves.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  Is there anything you don't know everything about?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  Synchronized swimming. Complete mystery to me.</p>
<p><i>Moves closer.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  Yep. Paraguay. Where does it come from?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  Paraguay.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  Who brought it through the Earth?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  It's all connected. The root systems, the molecules...the energy. Everything's 

  connected. </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  You sound like Miss Hartness.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  She's taught me a lot.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  Then why aren't you in your lesson?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  Sorry.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  It's alright. She was just—</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  —afraid. Yeah, they all are. The coven is—they're the most amazing women 

  I've ever met. But there's this look that they get. Like I'm gonna turn them 

  all into bangers and mash, or something. Which I'm not even really sure what 

  that is.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  They're cautious. I trust you understand that.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  I don't have that much power, I don't think.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  Everything's connected. You're connected to a great power, whether you feel 

  it or not.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  Well you should just take it from me.</p>
<p><i>She gets up and storms off, angry at herself. They walk toward a building.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  You know we can't. This isn't a hobby or an addiction. It's inside you now, 

  this magic. You're responsible for it.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  Will they always be afraid of me?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  Maybe. Can you handle it?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  I deserve a lot worse. I killed people, Giles.</p>
<p><i>They stop and look at each other.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  I've not forgotten.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  When you brought me here, I thought it was to kill me or to lock me in some 

  mystical dungeon for all eternity or—with the torture. Instead, you go all 

  Dumbledore on me. I'm learning about magic. All about energy and Gaia and root 

  systems.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  Do you want to be punished?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

  I wanna be Willow.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

  You are. In the end, we all are who we are, no matter how much we may appear

  Buffy's getting ready to send Dawn off to her first day of school. She is talking

<p><b>BUFFY<br/>
</b>Dawn! Xander's here.</p>
<p><b>DAWN (O.S.)</b><br/>

  Just a minute.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

  G'morning!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  (to Dawn) Well, you gotta eat something. I made cereal. </p>
<p><b>DAWN (O.S.)</b><br/>

  OK. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  (to Xander) You're unconscionably spiffy.</p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Ah, you put the box near the milk. I saw it on the food channel. Want something?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

  I ate. I'm good. How are you?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  My sister's about to go to the same high school that tried to kill me for three 

  years. I can't change districts, I can't afford private school, and I can't 

  begin to prepare for what could possibly come out of there. So, peachy with 

  a side of keen, that would be me.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

  Well here's a little something for what ails ya.</p>
<p><i>Xander gestures with the tube of papers he brought in.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Mmm. You got the rest.</p>
<p><i>Xander goes into the dining room. Buffy follows. He lays out the plans for

<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  Hey. Check out double-O Xander.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Go. Talk with your mouth full.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

  I've got two crews working on this diabolical yet lucrative new campus. One 

  here finishing the Science building. And one here, reinforcing the Gym. There 

  are no pentagrams, no secret passageways. Everything's up to code and safe as 

  houses.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Nothing creepy? Strange? From beyond?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  (with her mouth full) Maybe you're just paranoid.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

  Well, there is one interesting detail. I managed to scare up the plan from 

  the old high school. You remember the very center of Sunnydale's own hell mouth?</p>
<p><i>Xander puts up new and old plans to the window so they can see through them.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Under the library.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

  Right. So I lined up the plans, new and old. And right exactly where the library 

  was, we now have...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Principal's office.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  So the principal's evil? </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Or in a boatload of danger.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

  Well the last two principals were eaten. Who would even apply for that job?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Guess we'll see. Ooh, we have to leave though. You have everything? Books, 

  lunch, stakes?</p>

  And stay away from hyena people, or any lizard-type athletes, you know, or

  Hey, Buffy, I think it's pretty safe to say I'm not going to see anybody that's 

  invisible.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  am I right?</p>

  Uh, yeah. How did you—?</p>

  Well, I better get back to work. Gotta start deadening young minds. It's really

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  (To the phone) Hold on. (To Spike) You know what they are?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

  Manifest spirits controlled by a talisman, raised to seek vengeance. A 4-year-old 

  could figure it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  (To the phone) Hang tight. I'll find you. These things can hurt you. You can 

  hurt them too. Find a weapon. I'll come for you. (To Spike) Spike, you gonna 

  help me out?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

  This is my home. I belong here. Always been here. Cheers for stopping by. </p>
<p><i>Spike walks away from Buffy. He faces the wall and puts his hands on it.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

  (To himself) It's in the wall.</p>
<p><i>Spike turns away from her to put his hands on the wall. He starts to moan 

  softly.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  I'll get back to you.</p>
<p><i>She kicks down the door and leaves the room.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Guys? Resentful dead guys? This can't be good. Come on, manifest spirits, raised 

  up, controlled by a... talisman.</p>

  you.</p>
<p><b>KIT</b><br/>

  No. </p>
<p><b>DEAD GIRL</b><br/>

  Why do you think we picked you? The ones no one will miss. The ones that don't 

  belong. You spend all your time trying to get out of high school, and now you'll 

  never ever leave.</p>
<p><i>Dawn swings the brick-bag at the Dead Girl's knees and knocks her down.

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Yeah. The talisman must have been destroyed.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  How'd you know it was a talisman?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  There's always a talisman. The real question is who put it there. C'mon, you 

  guys, let's go find a way upstairs, assuming there is one.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

  You really weren't kidding about this place. I guess it hasn't changed.</p>

  OK. Come on, we still have a few more classes to live through.</p>
<p><i>Dawn kisses Buffy on the cheek, and walks away with her friends. The principal 

  walks up to Buffy.</i></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>

  Curiouser and curiouser.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  What is?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>

  Carlos Trejo and Kit Holburn, right? Possibly the only two students in this 

  school whose files are as thick as yours was.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  You really did your homework, didn't you?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>

  I was looking for one or both of them to actually implode in a fearsome way 

  right before midterms. And now I see that you got 'em socializing and hugging 

  and actually, if I'm not mistaken, headed to class.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Well, we shared an... encounter.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>

  Look, I know you're probably more than happy to get out of this place. But 

  I gotta tell you, Miss Summers, I think you belong here.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Hmm, new?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>

  Listen, I know this school's reputation. What, you think I got this job based 

  on seniority? We got a lot of troubled students here, and just enough money 

  to keep this place from caving in.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Yeah, you might need a little extra there.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>

  Well, we do have a community outreach program. And the money we could pay you... 

  wouldn't even fold. But it would just be a couple of days a week.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Are you asking me to be a counselor?</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>

  Well, we have a guidance counselor, but I was thinking the kids could use someone, 

  you know, closer to their age who still—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  I'm in!</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>

  What, you serious? You—you did hear the part about the money, right?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

  Yeah, I heard. My schedule might be a little funtastic, but, uh, I'll work 

  it out. I'd like to keep an eye on this place.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>

  Well, that's great. Look at that. It's not even noon, and I've already bullied 

  my first family member into helping out. I'm going to be the best principal 

  ever.</p>

  Back in the room where Spike was. He's still crouched down on the floor on his 

  tiptoes, hugging his knees. He looks vulnerable, like he's in there with someone 

  or something dangerous.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

  The thing is...I had a speech. I learned it all. Oh, God. She won't understand, 

  she won't understand.</p>
<p><i>Warren is circling Spike, addressing him as Spike cowers in the middle 

    of the room.</i></p>
<p> <b>WARREN</b><br/>

  Of course she won't understand, Sparky. I'm beyond her understanding. She's 

  a girl. Sugar and spice and everything...useless unless you're baking. I'm more 

  than that. More than flesh...</p>
<p><i>Warren morphs into Glory, who is still pacing and talking to Spike.</i></p>
<p> <b>GLORY</b><br/>

  ...more than blood. I'm... you know, I honestly don't think there's a human 

  word fabulous enough for me. Oh, my name will be on everyone's lips, assuming 

  their lips haven't been torn off. But not just yet. That's alright, though...</p>
<p><i>Glory morphs into Adam. Apparently this monster is something that can 

    change shape and impersonate other characters. The Morphing Monster is still 

    pacing.</i></p>
<p><b>MORPHING MONSTER (as ADAM)</b><br/>

  ...I can be patient. Everything is well within parameters. She's exactly where 

  I want her to be. And so are you, Number 17. You're right where you belong.</p>
<p><i>Morphing Monster changes to the Mayor and bends down on one knee to talk 

    to Spike at eye-level.</i></p>
<p><b>MORPHING MONSTER (as THE MAYOR)</b><br/>

    So what'd you think? You'd get your soul back and everything'd be Jim Dandy? 

    Soul's slipperier than a greased weasel. Why do you think I sold mine? (laughs) 

    Well, you probably thought that you'd be your own man, and I respect that, 

    but...</p>
<p><b>MORPHING MONSTER (as DRUSILLA)</b><br/>

    (touching Spike's face) ...you never will. You'll always be mine. You'll always 

    be in the dark with me, singing our little songs. You like our little songs, 

    don't you? You've always liked them, right from the beginning. And that's 

    where we're going...</p>
<p><b>MORPHING MONSTER (as THE MASTER)</b><br/>

    (stands) ...right back to the beginning. Not the Bang... not the Word... the 

    true beginning. The next few months are going to be quite a ride. And I think 

    we're all going to learn something about ourselves in the process. You'll 

    learn you're a pathetic schmuck, if it hasn't sunk in already. Look at you. 

    Trying to do what's right, just like her. You still don't get it. It's not 

    about right, not about wrong...</p>
<p><i>Morphing Monster walks around behind Spike, and when it reappears, it 

    has transformed into Buffy. As Buffy, it is standing with arms crossed in 

    front, with a smug and serious look on her face, glaring at Spike.</i></p>

  ...it's about power.</p>
