<p><b>1a     EXT.     CITY 
    STREET IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY - NIGHT<br/>
    A dark-haired girl is running through the arched hallway, looking over her 
    shoulder and panting from the exertion of running so fast. She's being chased. 
    Two people in hooded cloaks are chasing her. </b></p>
<p><b>1b     INT.     PARKING 
    GARAGE IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY - NIGHT<br/>
    A girl with hot pink hair with black bangs at her forehead, a nose ring, and 
    a metal collar is trying to escape her pursuers. Finally, she thinks she's 
    safe when she goes through a doorway to the outside near a crowd of club patrons, 
    but she is pushed back inside. Robed men close the door behind them and start 
    to fight with her. She is knocked to the ground, lying on her back. Finally, 
    one of the robed people pulls out a Jambaya (curved silver dagger) and stabs 
    her.</b></p>

    Giles enters the flat and sees Robson, who's found near a chair in the next 
    room. Giles goes to his side.</b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Robson! (takes off his glasses and starts to cry) Dear God, I thought you—</p>
<p><b>ROBSON</b><br/>
    (eyes flash open) Gather them. </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    I understand—</p>
<p><i>One of the robed men sneaks up behind Giles wielding a battle-axe. He

    Dawn's sitting on the living room floor in front of the couch, hugging a pillow, 
    amid the destruction from her earlier encounter. Willow comes to talk to her.</b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    I saw Mom.</p>

<p><b>4     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
    Jonathan is packing up his bag, when Andrew comes to him and puts his right 
    hand on Jonathan's shoulder. Jonathan looks up at Andrew, stands, and sees 
    Warren standing behind Andrew. Jonathan's eyes widen as Andres takes his left 
    hand and stabs him in the belly with a dagger. Jonathan looks at Andrew and 
    Warren, hurt. Jonathan collapses onto the metal object that they unearthed. 
    He bleeds profusely, with his blood filling the grooves in the object, as 
    Andrew and Warren stand there and watch. The metal object starts glowing.</b></p>

    STREET - NIGHT<br/>
    Show someone wearing black boots—someone's walking along the sidewalk. 
    Pan up: long black leather trench coat, blonde spiked hair. It's Andrew, looking 
    tough and menacing. Warren comes up to him and walks beside him.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    I did what you told me. It's not my fault it didn't work. </p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    I would do this stuff if I could.</p>

<p><i>5a     INT.     BASEMENT 
      AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
      Without any confusion, Principal Wood walks directly into the room where 
      the Seal of Danthazar is. Jonathan's body is still lying on top of the seal. 
      Principal Wood stares blankly, unflinching at the sight.</i></p>

<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (sighs) I just don't think I can kill anybody else. (shrugs)</p>

      OIL RIG SITE - NIGHT<br/>
      His work area lit by the headlights of his SUV, Principal Wood is digging 
      a hole. He stops, and rolls Jonathan's body into the shallow grave and throws 
      dirt over him.</i></p>

<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>
    It's my fault the ritual didn't work. I don't have as much blood as other 
    people. </p>

<p><b>6     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Willow drags Andrew home with her. They come in through the front door, with 
    Andrew carrying the groceries from the butcher's shop. Xander, Dawn, and Anya 
    are in the living room. Xander's finishing installing the new window.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Look who I found. Guess who was buying mass amounts of blood at the butcher's 
    shop.</p>

<p><b>7     INT.     DAWN'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Xander pushes Andrew into a chair and ties his wrists to it, in a similar 
    fashion to Spike's restraints. Anya's standing in front of Andrew, going through 
    his leather trench coat.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Just tell us what you know. (tightens restraint)</p>

    Ow. </p>

<p><b>8     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike is lying on the floor in shackles, both hands and feet chained to the 
    wall. His eyes are closed. Buffy walks downstairs with a bowl of water and 
    goes over to him. She dips a towel in the water and washes the blood off of 
    his face. </b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (in his face) I believe in you, Spike. </p>
<p><i>Spike looks at her with a face full of hope and amazement. Just then, 
    the lights flicker and go out. Someone bursts into the basement and pushes 
    Buffy away from Spike. She falls to the ground.</i></p>

    HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>

    down doors. Covered head to toe in long, black, hooded robes, these people 
    have batons and no eyes</b></p>

<p><b>10     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy goes down the stairs to the basement, followed by Xander. She stops 
    dead in her tracks when she sees the empty shackles that Spike was supposed 
    to be in.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    They were after Spike all along.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>11     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike is tied to the wheel-like construct with all four corners of his body 
    pulled in opposite directions. Spike's body has symbols carved into his chest. 
    Spike/First morphs into Buffy's form. A Harbinger cranks a wheel attached 
    to a mechanism that hoists the wheel Spike's tied to into the air. Spike is 
    now hanging from the wheel about ten feet from the ground, bleeding steadily 
    from his ritualized symbol-shaped cuts.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    I'm getting a little tired of subtle. It's about time we bring some authority 
    to our presence. Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?</p>
<p><i>Spike's blood is falling on the Seal of Danthazar that's right below him. 
    It's pooling in the grooves and being absorbed into the seal. The seal starts 
    to glow. One by one, the pointed tips of the pentagram at its center fold 
    up, forming a pyramid. Light comes out from under it. The pyramid sinks into 
    the ground. The remaining pieces of the seal follow suit. Spike glares at 
    Buffy/First, then watches the hole where the seal is. Something sticks it's 
    withered, gray, pointy-fingered hand out of the hole. A monster climbs out 
    wearing black leather. Pan up to show its horrible disfigured face. It's bald 
    with a distinct vampire forehead and brows and trademark fanged teeth. It 
    looks gaunt, with extremely hollow cheekbones. It raises its hands toward 
    the sky and looks around the room, growling menacingly.</i></p>

<h3><b>PROLOGUE:</b></h3>
<p><b>12     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    LIVING ROOM - NIGHT<br/>
    Someone's sweeping up broken glass from the floor. Pan up to show it's Xander. 
    He stops and addresses the room. Buffy's doing research at the dining room 
    table, sitting next to Willow who is using her laptop computer. Anya and Dawn 
    are on the couch in the living room looking through books.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (exasperated) It's a loop...like the Mummy Hand. I'm doomed to replace these 
    windows for all eternity. You know, maybe we should just board these up until 
    things are less hellmouthy.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (holds up a notebook she was reading) Nothing...and nothing. (holds up two 
    other books, one in each hand) Cliff Notes to nothing. Nothing abridged...</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (looks up from her computer) Yeah, my search isn't turning anything up either. 
    (to Buffy) Are you sure this thing called itself The First?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before 
    anything else.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (looking up over her reading glasses) Please, how many times have I heard 
    that line in my demon days? "I'm so rotten, they don't even have a word 
    for it. I'm bad. Baddy bad bad bad. Does it make you horny?" (everyone 
    stares at her) Or terrified. Whatever.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It wasn't a line. When I came up against this thing, I felt it. It was ancient 
    and enormous. It nearly got Angel to kill himself. And if we don't rescue 
    Spike soon, God only knows what the First'll get him to do.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (looks over at Andrew, who's passed out, tied to a chair) I wish Sleeping 
    Ugly would come to. He's been out all night.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Yes, he was just starting to squeal when the spooky SWAT attacked. Said The 
    First was held up at the Seal of...Danzar something?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (stands, walks to Andrew) Hmm. Maybe he's just faking so he doesn't have to 
    answer any more questions. (punches him in the face, stands back to observe) 
    Hm. Or maybe he's in a fugue state.(rears back to punch him again, but Buffy 
    interrupts)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Dawn. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    What?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    He'll come to when he comes to. Keep reading. If we're gonna rescue Spike, 
    we need to figure out how to fight this thing.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (pouts, goes back to the couch) Anya gets to hit him.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Hey! Here, The First!...Bank of Delaware. Sorry.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (sighs) Hand me the Watchers' Codex again. (someone hands her an old-looking 
    book)</p>
<p><b>JOYCE</b><br/>
    Can I get you anything else, baby? (Buffy recognizes the voice and turns to 
    look) How 'bout some tea?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (searching her, shocked) Mom? (sighs, closes eyes) You're not real.</p>
<p><b>JOYCE</b><br/>
    (bends to Buffy's eye level) OK, is that, uh, slang, like you're not for real, 
    or—?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (looks her in the eyes) You're The First.</p>
<p><b>JOYCE</b><br/>
    Oh, baby, you're so tired, you're not making sense. Maybe you should get some 
    sleep.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No.</p>
<p><b>JOYCE</b><br/>
    You can't win against this thing. Not if you don't rest.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (visibly shaken) Stop. Stop being like this. It's a lie.</p>
<p><b>JOYCE</b><br/>
    I don't want to scare you, but I want you to take care. (slowly) You need 
    to wake up.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What?</p>
<p><b>XANDER (O.S.)</b><br/>
    You're dreaming. Buff, wake up.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (having fallen asleep at the dining room table, she wakes) Hm? Did you see 
    it? (looks around)</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    There's nothing to see. You were just doing a little dream talking, that's 
    all.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Oh.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    You OK? What'd you see?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (shakes head) Nothing. It was nothing.</p>

<p><b>13     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - NIGHT<br/>
    In the background, chanting in Latin can be heard. Spike is being dragged, 
    face up, along the dirt ground. His chest wounds have started to close, but 
    the symbols cut into him remain clear on his chest. Spike looks around, a 
    little disoriented, and sees Harbingers with torches and someone dragging 
    him. It's the UberVamp dragging Spike into a special room. The UberVamp stops, 
    lets go of Spike's leg, and stares at him. Spike/First walks into the room.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE/FIRST</b><br/>
    Go on. Give it a kick then. You always liked that, didn't you?</p>
<p><i>Spike/First morphs into Drusilla's form.</i></p>
<p><b>DRUSILLA/FIRST</b><br/>
    Kick a dolly when he's down. That was always your style. </p>
<p><i>Drusilla/First kneels to watch UberVamp kick Spike in the ribs so hard 
    he rolls over. Spike lifts his head to glare angrily at the UberVamp. The 
    UberVamp hisses and growls at Spike.</i></p>
<p><b>DRUSILLA/FIRST</b><br/>
    Has buckets of energy, poor dear. He's been laying in wait for his moment 
    since before the bug walked. (stands, walks to UberVamp) There, there, pet. 
    (clicks tongue) Soon as the moon comes, you'll have your carnage. (looks at 
    Spike) Little girls tear so easily, like pink paper. 'Til then, we'll have 
    our way with this one. Got it coming, he does. (hums)</p>
<p><i>The UberVamp goes back to Spike, kicking him. Spike screams.</i></p>

<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>14     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    LIVING ROOM - DAY<br/>
    Show Andrew, still passed out and tied to a chair in the living room. Someone 
    splashes water in his face. He shudders a little, but doesn't regain consciousness. 
    Show Dawn and Anya standing there looking at him. Anya's got a cup in her 
    hand.</b></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    That was something.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (to Anya) Maybe if you threw hot water on him.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Good thinking.</p>
<p><i>Dawn and Anya walk toward the kitchen, but Buffy comes into the room, 
    so they go sit on the couch instead.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Whoa, hey.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Hi. (Buffy stares at them, but they avoid eye contact) Nothing.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (wringing hands) Oh, um, I thought you were gonna ask us what we were doing.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, was going to ask—</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (Andrew coughs) Oh! Look who's awake. (stands and goes to Andrew)</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (follows Dawn) Silly Andrew, (slaps his chin gently) you drooled all over 
    yourself.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (to Buffy) I'm—I was about to be dead. You saved me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (steps up between Dawn and Anya) For the time being. (crosses arms) But if 
    you don't tell us what we need to know, then I'm gonna offer you to The First 
    on a platter and let him chop you into tiny pieces.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    The first what?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    The name of the evil thing that pretended to be Warren to get you to kill 
    Jonathan.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Oh, not very ominous sounding.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    No, i-it is if you understand the context.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    No, an evil name should be like Lex or Voldemort or—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Hey, I was intimidating here. (flanking Buffy, Dawn and Anya turn and glare 
    at Andrew)</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Oh, sorry. Um, go ahead.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (sighs) Forget it. Where's the seal?</p>

<p><b>15     INT.     BASEMENT

    Buffy, Dawn and Xander are following Andrew through the school basement. </b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    It's around this corner, I think.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You better be right this time.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    I told you—I'm not sure.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>16     INT.     SEAL 
    OF DANTHAZAR ROOM IN BASEMENT AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Andrew leads Buffy, Dawn, and Xander to the room where he killed Jonathan.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Maybe you should get sure. I'm sick of all the runaround with you— (sees 
    the seal of Danthazar) Whoa. Check out the goat-heady badness.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What's it do?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    I don't know. Something not good. It didn't work 'cause... there wasn't enough 
    blood. (turns to leave) OK. (Buffy stops him)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (investigating the wheel they hung Spike from last episode) There's blood 
    on this. Lots. (turns to Buffy) Looks like the first made another sacrifice. 
    Or a music video.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    The seal could've been activated. I bet that's what the First needed Spike 
    for. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (panics) That wasn't there before. I had nothing to do with that.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Thanks for clearing that up 'cause otherwise we might've thought you were 
    up to no good here at the satanic manhole cover. You killed your best friend!</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (softly) He's in a place of joy and peace. He told me. (Buffy rolls her eyes)</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    No, nobody told you. You got tricked by a fake ghost.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Boys, can we save the encounter session? We need to cover this thing up. (grabs 
    nearby shovels, hands them out) Whatever it does, we can't leave it exposed 
    like this.</p>
<p><i>They start shoveling dirt over the seal.</i></p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>17     INT.     BASEMENT

    After covering up the seal, Xander and Andrew walk out of the Seal of Danthazar 
    room and into the hallway, followed by Buffy and Dawn.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Man, this place gives me the creeps. It's like in Wonder Woman, issue 297/299—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    "Catacombs"—yeah with the skeletons.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW &amp; XANDER</b><br/>
    (simultaneously, smiling and nodding) That was cool.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (suddenly frowns and pushes Andrew) Move it. This way.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    So what next? We found the seal, but no Spike. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (sighs) I don't know. The first was camped underground last time I found him, 
    but—</p>
<p><i>Principal Wood passes them in the basement hallway, carrying a shovel, 
    looking a little disheveled.</i></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
    Buffy?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (turns to face him) Hey.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
    Hey. I—thought that you were, um—</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Sick? She was. Oh, vomiting and oozing from various places and—</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL</b><br/>
    Yeah, I remember, so please don't go on.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Oh, but now, it's amazing. The doctor gave her some cream.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (overlapping with Dawn) Pills. (Principal looks back and forth between them) 
    And a cream. And I'm all better. (stares at the Principal's shovel)</p>

    But we haven't found any information on The First. No documentation—</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (crosses arms) That's because it predates any written history, and it rarely

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    That means all the Council's records are-are destroyed?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Annabelle. (Girl #2 unzips her book bag, takes two books and a stack of files 
    from it and lays them on the coffee table in front of Willow) That's what's 
    left. (Willow, Anya, Dawn and Buffy each take some of the new material and 
    peruse it) The mystic secrets of the Watchers. And whatever I could find on 
    The First. When I learned what was happening, I-I, um, I stole them.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    And you blew the Council up! See, this is what happens when you're all stuffy 
    and repressed. You overreact.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Not—I didn't. Must've been an agent of The First, after my little burglary 
    session. The knowledge contained in these files had to be protected, and there 
    wasn't time for-for bureaucracy or debate. The Council knows no other way.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>

    them their lives! (everyone turns and stares, he sits back) Go on.</p>

    tape over his mouth) But what do these records say about The First?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Uh, very little. It can change form. Uh, it only appears in the guise of someone 
    who's passed away.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Our ghosts.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Also it's not corporeal. It can't touch or fight on it's own. It only works

    Shh! Molly, Mr. Giles doesn't need us prattling on.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (sits on arm of couch) The First is unlike anything we've faced before. I 
    mean, there's evil and then there's the thing that created evil, the source.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    And that's what this thing claims to be?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    That's what it is. It has eternities to act, endless resources. (stands) How 
    to defeat it—I-I— (sighs) honestly I don't know. But we have to 
    find a way. If the slayer line is eliminated, then the hell mouth has no guardian. 
    The balance is destroyed. (walks up to Buffy) I'm afraid it falls to you, 
    Buffy. Sorry. I mean, we'll do what we can, but you're the only one who has 
    the strength to protect these girls—and the world—against what's 
    coming.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    But no pressure.</p>
<p><b>GIRL #3</b><br/>
    (walks to the center of the room, addressing everyone) That's it? That's the 
    plan? I don't see how one person, even a slayer, could protect us. I saw what 
    those bringer guys can do. They tore apart my watcher.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Of course we'll use all our resources—</p>
<p><b>GIRL #3</b><br/>
    And if this thing is the root of all evil, isn't the hell mouth it's number 
    one vacation spot? I mean, don't you think we should be hiding our asses on 
    the other side of the globe?</p>
<p><b>ANNABELLE</b><br/>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, she's not wrong. We need more muscle. That's why we need to find Spike.

    breaks the stalactite off of the cave ceiling and bashes the UberVamp's head

    against him, trying to get out of the hole, but the UberVamp pulls her back

    the UberVamp in the head and tries again to crawl out of the hole. She barely

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    So, The First shows up, and now this? You think it's a coincidence?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

    away. </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    So, until sunset, I suggest you get some rest. A few hours sleep will do a 
    world of difference.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No sleep today. Can't. </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Oh, come on, you're exhausted.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Ah, it comes with the gig. Somehow I don't think taking on prehistoric evil 
    comes with nap time. Sorry, potential guys. I know you came a long way, and 
    you wanna get into it, but the best thing you can do right now is just sit 
    tight, wait it out. I'm gonna go to work, see what I can find out. I'll be 
    back before sunset.</p>
