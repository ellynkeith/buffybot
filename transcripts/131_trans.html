<h3>TEASER (RECAP SEGMENT):</h3>
<p><b>GILES (V.O.)</b><br/>
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:</p>
<p><b>1     EXT.     MEXICAN 
    CAR - NIGHT<br/>
    Jonathan's driving with Andrew as passenger. The old El Camino car is heavily 
    adorned in super-stereotypical Mexican style: older model car with fringe 
    around the top of the windshield and lots of decorations.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    You're just scared.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>
    Of course I'm scared. Last time we were here, 33.3bar percent of us were flayed 
    alive. </p>

<p><b>2     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
    From behind Andrew, Warren walks out from behind some lockers and walks up 
    to Andrew.</b></p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    Nice job.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Do you have any idea how hard it's been to act this cool?</p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    Now, that death thing was all part of the master plan. If short round pulls 
    off his end of the bargain, we'll both become gods.</p>

<p><b>3     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
    Jonathan is packing up his bag, when Andrew comes to him and puts his right 
    hand on Jonathan's shoulder. Jonathan looks up at Andrew, stands, and sees 
    Warren standing behind Andrew. Jonathan's eyes widen as Andres takes his left 
    hand and stabs him in the belly with a dagger. Jonathan looks at Andrew and 
    Warren, hurt. Jonathan collapses onto the metal object that they unearthed. 
    He bleeds profusely, with his blood filling the grooves in the object, as 
    Andrew and Warren stand there and watch. The metal object starts glowing.</b></p>

    Joyce is standing there, all glowy and robed in white, talking to Dawn, who's 
    still sitting on the floor.</b></p>
<p><b>JOYCE</b><br/>
    Things are coming, Dawn. </p>

    It wasn't her.</p>

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    This big evil that's been promising to devour us—well I think it's started 
    chomping. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    foreign girls being killed.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I'm just a guy with his ear to the ground, but even I can feel it. Something's 
    coming. I don't know what exactly, but something's brewing. And it's so big, 
    ugly and damned it makes you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces.

<blockquote>
<p><i>8a     EXT.     CITY 
      STREET IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY - NIGHT<br/>
      A dark-haired girl is running through the arched hallway, looking over her 
      shoulder and panting from the exertion of running so fast. She's being chased. 
      Two people in hooded cloaks are chasing her. Two hooded figures hold her 
      down, and a third figure raises an arched, shiny, silver dagger (possibly 
      an Arabian "Jambaya") and thrusts down at her.</i></p>
<p><i>8b     INT.     PARKING 
      GARAGE IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY - NIGHT<br/>
      A girl with hot pink hair with black bangs at her forehead, a nose ring, 
      and a metal collar is trying to escape her pursuers. Finally, she thinks 
      she's safe when she goes through a doorway to the outside near a crowd of 
      club patrons, but she is pushed back inside. Robed men close the door behind 
      them and start to fight with her. She is knocked to the ground, lying on 
      her back. Finally, one of the robed people pulls out a Jambaya (curved silver 
      dagger) and stabs her.</i></p>

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Buffy, he's been feeding... on human blood. That's gotta do stuff.</p>

    the things he's done—killing, burying, and all the rest.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

<p><i>Spike's horrified. His face is one of complete shock and disbelief that 
    he could have actually done those things. Buffy walks over to Spike, still 
    carrying the wooden handle. She stands in front of him. He looks at her, knowing 
    his fate, and scoots out of the cubby hole he was hiding in. He's crying.</i></p>

<h3>Prologue:</h3>
<p><b>14     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    The gang's cleaning up the living room from the aftermath of when Joyce visited 
    Dawn in 7x07 "Conversations With Dead People." Xander's working 
    on the large picture window behind the couch, covering the hole with plastic. 
    Anya's replacing the home decor items on the mantle. Willow's sweeping off 
    a table, when Dawn comes to talk to her.</b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    So the basement was filled with bodies?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Apparently.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    And Spike could've sired countless others and buried them around town. And 
    we're waiting for him to do what, exactly? Do something crazy?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (sighs) It's not that simple.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Shouldn't we stab him through the chest? Isn't that what we do when these 
    things happen?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Look, Buffy knows what she's doing.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Well, Xander, you know what we're all talking about. I mean, you've always 
    been part of the "Spike is evil" faction.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    I've got a house to put back together.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Fine. You guys keep your heads buried in the sand, but I think we should prepare 
    ourselves for the possibility that William the Bloody is back.</p>

    Show someone wearing black boots—someone's walking along the sidewalk. 
    Pan up: long black leather trench coat, blonde spiked hair. It's Andrew, looking 
    tough and menacing. Warren comes up to him and walks beside him.</b></p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    All right. (claps) Looking good. How do you feel? </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Good.</p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    Excellent. We've got work to do.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    I have to do work right now? Can't I just walk around for a while in my coat?</p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    Don't go soft on me now. We're right in the trench, and the exhaust port's 
    in sight.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    I thought that was it. I did what you told me. It's not my fault it didn't 
    work. Why do I have to do all the wet works?</p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    (stops walking) Hey! You know the rules. I can't take corporeal form. Here, 
    feel. (nods) Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (sticks hand through Warren's chest) Cool.</p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    Pretty bitchin', right? I'm like Obi Wan?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Or Patrick Swayze.</p>
<p><b>WARREN</b><br/>
    Believe me, I would do this stuff if I could. I can't. I need you. You're 
    my iron fist.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (sighs) I just don't think I can kill anybody else. (shrugs)</p>
<p><i>Warren morphs into Jonathan.</i></p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>
    Oh, will you stop whining about that?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    I didn't want to kill you. Warren made me. </p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>
    Hey, I'm glad he did. (chuckles) This is the best thing that's ever happened 
    to me.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (crosses arms) It didn't hurt too much? I-I'm not very good at stabbing. </p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>
    You know, it wasn't that bad. It was like a sharp pain, then a burning, then 
    a general queasiness. It's kinda like when I used to get ulcers in high school, 
    only at the end I became one with light and hope. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    I can't do it. I can't do it anymore.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>
    Hey, this isn't your fault, OK. It's my fault the ritual didn't work. I screwed 
    up. I'm little—I-I don't have as much blood as other people. And I probably 
    should've told someone I was anemic. Don't worry. We're gonna fix it. You 
    gotta trust us. We know what we're doing. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    I can't kill anybody else.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN</b><br/>
    OK, calm down. We can work around that.</p>

    Buffy's tying Spike's wrists to a chair he's sitting in.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (sighs) We're gonna get to the bottom of this. We just can't take any chances.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Don't... Make it tighter—the knots'll give. I get free, someone's gonna 
    die. </p>

<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>17     INT.     PRINCIPAL 
    WOOD'S OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Principal Wood's sitting at his desk, interviewing two teenage boys seated 
    in chairs in front of his desk.</b></p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
    Now, guys, look, we can settle this one of two ways. You can repaint the walls, 
    or I can suspend you and report this little incident on your permanent record.</p>
<p><b>PUNK #1</b><br/>
    Fine. Do that.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
    OK, I was bluffing. I hadn't really thought that one through. (leans forward) 
    Listen, this whole permanent record thing is such a myth anyway. Colleges 
    never ask for anything past your SAT scores, and it's not like employers are 
    gonna be calling up to check to see how many days you missed back in high 
    school. So, listen, I-I could suspend you, (stands, walks around desk) but 
    that would mean calling your parents, alerting your teachers, filling out 
    paperwork, and, quite possibly, having to talk to the school board—(sits 
    on desk in front of them) all of which sounds positively exhausting to me. 
    No. No, I think it would be much easier if I just called the police, let them 
    deal with it. (looks in their eyes) Oh, and, in case you're wondering, this 
    is the part where I'm not bluffing.</p>
<p><b>PUNK #2</b><br/>
    (looks at the other boy) We'll repaint it. </p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
    Good job. (there's a knock at his door) Excuse me. (opens door) Miss Summers. 
    I'm with students.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    I just wanted to tell you that Buffy won't be coming in today. She's really 
    sick.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
    Oh, no.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Yeah, last night she was vomiting, and then this morning she was vomiting 
    some more, and then, just when we thought she was done, she was vomiting again. 
    (laughs)</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
    Yeah, we got that stomach flu going around.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Her exact words were, "I've got stuff coming out of both ends."</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
    Thank you. That's very helpful.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (smiles) Sure. No problem. (to kids) Hey, guys. How's it going?</p>
<p><b>PUNK #2</b><br/>
    Pretty good.</p>
<p><b>PRINCIPAL WOOD</b><br/>
    Um, tell your sister not to worry about it. We'll soldier on without her here. 
    Just, um, tell her to concentrate on getting better. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Yeah, she'll be fine. She just needs to get some stuff out of her system.

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    You hated yourself, and you took it out on me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You figured that out just now?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Soul's not all about moonbeams and pennywhistles, luv. It's about self-loathing. 
    I get it. Had to travel 'round the world, but I understand you now. I understand 
    the violence inside.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Violence? William the Bloody now has insight into violence?</p>

    He's got a good chunk taken out of his neck, but he'll be all right. Had to 
    tie him up again, but mainly just to keep him from scratching at his bandages. 
    (to Buffy) What the hell happened up there?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I-I don't know. Spike and I were having a conversation, and he was fine. I 
    mean, you know, fine as Spike can be. And then I went to check on you guys, 
    and when I got back, it was like he was a completely different person.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Different like "William the Bloody" type different?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    He was talking to someone. I heard through the door, he was having this conversation. 
    And then he started singing.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Maybe it's another musical. (Buffy glares) A much crappier musical.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    He—he mentioned something about a song in the cellar. Uh, a-and he changed 
    there, too—I mean instantly became another person.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Trigger.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    The horse?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    No, in his head. It's a trigger. It's a brainwashing term. It's how the military 
    makes sleeper agents. They-they brainwash operatives and condition them with 
    a specific trigger, like a song, that makes 'em drastically change at a moment's 
    notice.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Is this left over from your days in the Army?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    No, this is left over from every Army movie I've ever seen. But it makes sense. 
    We've had ghosts or something haunting us, right? Well, what if Spike's ghosts 
    have figured out a way to—not only haunt him—what if they figured 
    out how to—how to control him?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Spike said he's been seeing things since I found him in the basement.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    So, he gets his soul back, he starts seeing spooky things, and he goes extra-extra-crazy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    This trigger. How do we holster—safety, or—I don't know guns. How 
    do we make it stop?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Well, usually the operative completes his task and either blows his head off 
    or steals a submarine. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    All right. I need information. If Spike's a bomb, then I need to know how 
    to diffuse him. (to Dawn and Willow) You two, I wanna know what did this to 
    him. Spirits, ghosts, demons—check the lot of them. Look for anything 
    that could haunt or-or possibly control like this. I need to know exactly 
    what we're dealing with. </p>

<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Buffy, you have to kill me.</p>

    You don't understand. When I left the room earlier, I heard you talking to 
    someone—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Do you have any idea what I'm capable of? </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I was in the cellar with you. I saw what you did.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I'm not talking about the cellar. The people in the cellar got off easy. I'm 
    talking about me. Buffy, you have never met the real me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (crosses arms) Believe me, I'm well aware of what you're capable of.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    No, you got off easy too. (stands) Do you know how much blood you can drink 
    from a girl before she'll die? I do. You see, the trick is to drink just enough 
    to know how to damage them just enough so that they'll still cry when you— 
    (chokes up) 'cause it's not worth it if they don't cry.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It's not your fault. You're not the one doing this.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I already did it. It's already done. (paces, then steps purposefully toward 
    Buffy) You wanna know what I've done to girls Dawn's age? (beat) This is me 
    Buffy. You've got to kill me before I get out.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    We can keep you locked up. Keep you here and we'll figure out—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Have you ever really asked yourself why you can't do it? Off me? After everything 
    I've done to you, to people around you. It's not love. We both know that.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You fought by my side. You've saved lives. You've helped—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Don't do that. (rolls eyes) Don't rationalize this into some noble act. We 
    both know the truth of it. (looks down and away) You like men who hurt you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (looks at Buffy) You need the pain we cause you. You need the hate. You need 
    it to do your job, to be the slayer.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No. I don't hate like that. Not you, or myself. Not anymore. You think you 
    have insight now because your soul's drenched in blood? You don't know me. 
    You don't even know you. Was that you who killed those people in the cellar? 
    Was that you who waited for those girls?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    There's no one else.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    That's not true. Listen to me. You're not alive because of hate or pain. You're 
    alive because I saw you change. Because I saw your penance. </p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Be easier, wouldn't it, it if were an act, but it's not. (walks toward him) 
    You faced the monster inside of you and you fought back. You risked everything 
    to be a better man.</p>

    withered, gray, pointy-fingered hand out of the hole. A monster climbs out 
    wearing black leather. Pan up to show its horrible disfigured face. It's bald

    looks gaunt, with extremely hollow cheekbones. It raises its hands toward
