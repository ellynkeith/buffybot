    Dawn's sitting on the living room floor in front of the couch, hugging a pillow, 
    amid the destruction from her earlier encounter. Willow comes to talk to her.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Dawn, what happened here?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    I saw Mom.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.</p>
<p><b>2     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike hands and feet chained to the wall. He lunges at Buffy, who stares him 
    straight in the eyes.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (in his face) I believe in you, Spike. </p>
<p><i>Spike looks at her with a face full of hope and amazement. Just then, 
    the lights flicker and go out. Someone bursts into the basement and pushes 
    Buffy away from Spike. She falls to the ground.</i></p>

<p><b>3     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Robed men break into the house from all angles, smashing windows and breaking 
    down doors. Covered head to toe in long, black, hooded robes, these people 
    have batons and no eyes</b></p>

<p><b>4     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy goes down the stairs to the basement, followed by Xander. She stops 
    dead in her tracks when she sees the empty shackles that Spike was supposed 
    to be in.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    They were after Spike all along.</p>

<p><b>5     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike is tied to the wheel-like construct with all four corners of his body 
    pulled in opposite directions. Spike's body has symbols carved into his chest. 
    Spike/First morphs into Buffy's form. A Harbinger cranks a wheel attached 
    to a mechanism that hoists the wheel Spike's tied to into the air. Spike is 
    now hanging from the wheel about ten feet from the ground, bleeding steadily 
    from his ritualized symbol-shaped cuts.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY (V.O.)<br/>
</b>You know what we're up against. The First.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?</p>
<p><i>Spike's blood is falling on the Seal of Danthazar that's right below him. 
    It's pooling in the grooves and being absorbed into the seal. The seal starts 
    to glow. One by one, the pointed tips of the pentagram at its center fold 
    up, forming a pyramid. Light comes out from under it. The pyramid sinks into 
    the ground. The remaining pieces of the seal follow suit. A monster climbs 
    out wearing black leather. Pan up to show its horrible disfigured face. It's 
    bald with a distinct vampire forehead and brows and trademark fanged teeth. 
    It looks gaunt, with extremely hollow cheekbones. It raises its hands toward 
    the sky and looks around the room, growling menacingly.</i></p>

    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT<br/>
    The UberVamp has caught up to Buffy, grabbing her from behind and throwing 
    her into a concrete wall. She steps back, still standing, as the UberVamp 
    literally crawls up the wall to gain momentum and height to kick her in the 
    face, knocking Buffy to the ground. Then he kicks her in the head again before 
    grabbing her arm and throwing Buffy through a concrete block wall. The wall 
    crumbles down on top of her, the roof caves in, and there's blackness.</b></p>
<p><b>GILES (V.O.)</b><br/>
    As Neanderthals are to human beings, the Turok-Han are to vampires—ferociously 
    powerful killing machines, as single-minded as animals. </p>

    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Buffy and Giles are in the kitchen talking to the three slayers in training,

    Buffy opens the front door to leave, but sees Giles standing there on her 
    front porch when she opens it. Buffy goes to hug Giles, but is cut off when 
    three girls she's never met walk right into her house.</b></p>

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Dawn's standing in front of the three girls Giles brought with him. The three 
    girls are lined up against the wall, and Dawn's inspecting them, arms crossed 
    in front of her. </b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    They're all slayers?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like 
    them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're 
    all on their way to Sunnydale.</p>

    A charter bus opens its doors, and a couple of people walk down the steps

    wearing denim overalls and carrying a backpack. She looks around.</b></p>

    bag.</b></p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Right. How many girls arriving this time?</p>

    Just one. But since Giles has the coven searching for other slayers in waiting, 
    I bet we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough.</p>

    BUS STATION - NIGHT<br/>
    When Rona looks up, she sees two black-robed, hooded, eyeless men, the bringers, 
    coming toward her with knives in their hands. She backs up against the wall, 
    panicked and breathing heavily, and sinks down to the ground. Just then, the 
    pair of bringers between the buses is lifted off the ground and goes flying 
    apart, revealing Buffy, who had thrown them to the ground. Buffy walks up 
    to Rona, who is still cowering on the ground.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    and finally injures and overpowers it. Buffy grabs some nearby barbed wire 
    and slips it around the Turok-Han's throat. It falls to the ground, and Buffy 
    pulls on the wire hard enough to sever its head. The Turok-Han explodes in 
    a cloud of dust in front of her. </b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (to the slayers-in-training) I don't know what's coming next, but I do know

    White-shirted, but and bruised Buffy is standing before him holding a bringer's 
    knife in her hand. Buffy approaches him slowly and cuts him loose of his chains. 
    He collapses forward and catches himself, bracing with his hand on her shoulder. 
    When he touches her and realizes she's real, he smiles and squints, searching 
    her face. She looks into his eyes, tapping an emotional connection between 
    them.</b></p>

<h3><b>PROLOGUE:</b></h3>
<p><b>19     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    CEMETERY - NIGHT<br/>
    Rona and Vi are walking through the cemetery nervously, holding stakes, being 
    as quiet as they can be. </b></p>
<p><i>Something behind them steps on a branch and makes a cracking sound, and 
    the girls turn to look. It's Spike—in vampire visage. He punches Rona 
    to the ground. Vi tries to stake him, but Spike catches her hand and grabs 
    her, and twists her arm behind her back. He puts his arm around her throat, 
    growls and goes to bite her neck. Vi screams. Spike stops before biting her, 
    looks up, and lets his vamp face fade away. Vi squeaks with fright. Still 
    holding her, he looks up, and talks to people in front of him.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    OK, these two are dead. Why?</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (stands, dusts herself off, to Spike) 'Cause the black chick always gets it 
    first?</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    (to Spike) Ow!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What was that, Rona?</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    I'm dead because he's a vampire. I don't have slayer strength, slayer speed—i-it 
    wasn't a fair fight.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (still holding his arm to her neck) Vi, do you think I care about a fair fight?</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    (tentatively) No, no sir. You don't play by the rules, and I have learned 
    a valuable lesson of some sort. (Spike twists her arm behind her back) Ow!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    OK, Spike. (he lets Vi go; she walks up to Molly and Kennedy who are standing 
    near Buffy) You're right. You don't have slayer strength. But that doesn't 
    mean that you're not strong. You have inherent abilities that others do not 
    have.</p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    (taking notes on a pad) Not like you do.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, not yet, but it's there. You have the potential. You have strength, speed, 
    instinct. You just have to learn to trust yourself. Rona, what did your instincts 
    tell you to do just then?</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (half-heartedly) Block his attack, keep him off balance, gain the advantage...?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, they didn't.</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (frankly) They told me to run.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Vi?</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    (rubbing her wrist) They told me to run. They're still sort of telling me 
    to run.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Don't fight on his terms. Your gut's telling them to run, run. OK? Regain 
    the higher ground. Make the fight your own. Spike, what did your instincts 
    tell you to do just then?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Hunt. Kill. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (walks out in front of the girls) Come at me, (Spike raises his eyebrows and 
    smiles a little) full speed. (to slayers-in-training) He needs to kill to 
    live. That tells you everything you need to know. </p>
<p><i>Spike growls and lunges at Buffy. She ducks, and he ends up lunging face-first 
    into a headstone. He falls to the ground, lying flat on his back, and Buffy 
    straddles him, holding one hand to his throat and pointing a stake above his 
    heart with the other.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (to slayers-in-training) Instinct. Understand his, but trust yours. You were 
    chosen for a reason. (Spike groans softly, to Spike) Are you OK? (lets go 
    of his throat)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I'm... fine. (tries to sit up) Couple of ribs ain't quite set right since— 
    I'm fine.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Lemme see. (lifts up his shirt a little to inspect his ribs)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    No, it's just—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (sweetly, concerned) Spike. (touches his skin)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (reaches for her hand, holds it) I'm gonna be OK.</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    That's hot.</p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    (still taking notes) So, we're supposed to, like, make out with them or something?</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    (still rubbing her wrist and holding a stake) Careful, Buffy. Just when you 
    think it's part of the lesson, he'll (gestures to her hurt wrist) hurt your 
    arm.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (stands, offers her hand to Spike, helps him stand) Molly, Kennedy, let's 
    go. You're up. Next lesson.</p>

<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>20     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Buffy, carrying a battle-axe, is pacing back and forth disapprovingly in front 
    of the girls while they chatter. Rona and Kennedy are talking, and Molly and 
    Vi are talking. Dawn's sitting on the stairs, watching them through the stair 
    rail.</b></p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    No way. One armed pushups are bull. </p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    I can do 'em. I can do the kinda way you clap between.</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    I'm more of a chin up kinda girl. I can do chin-ups 'til the cows come home.</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    You're saying demon, and I don't mean to ... Oh, bananas! Imagine yourself 
    covered in human viscera.... (Molly and Vi giggle and squeal as they continue 
    talking)</p>
<p><i>Buffy stops pacing and hurls the battle-axe at the bull's-eye target hung 
    on the wall. The axe point lands in the center, a perfect bull's-eye. Everyone 
    stops talking and looks at her, a little frightened. She glares at them sternly.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You're all gonna die. But you knew that already. (paces in front of them) 
    'Cause that's the cool reward for being human. Big dessert at the end of the 
    meal. Don't kid yourselves, you guys. This whole thing is all about death. 
    (stands still) You think you're different 'cause you might be the next slayer? 
    Death is what a slayer breathes, what a slayer dreams about when she sleeps. 
    Death is what a slayer lives. My death could make you the next slayer. (walks 
    back to retrieve her axe from the target) Oh, goody. Rapt attention. I love 
    that so much. (pulls out the axe) Now, where was I? Ah. (sets down the axe, 
    walks back to the front) If we go with what Anya's resources are telling us, 
    then The First is in remission for a while, which we think means advantage 
    us.</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    Well, what does that mean? About The First?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (crosses her arms) As best we can tell, he—or precisely "it"—was 
    putting a lot of stock in that UberVamp thing, the Chaka Khan.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (from the stairs) Turok-Han?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (doesn't acknowledge Dawn, pacing) So when I kicked its ass, the whole Firsty 
    circus decided to back off for a while. Good news? Means we probably don't 
    have to worry about it pulling Spike's strings for a while. (stands still) 
    Here's the half-empty. Time away means time to regroup. And part of that regrouping 
    is coming back stronger than ever. The odds are against us. Time is against 
    us. And some of us will die in this battle. Decide now that it's not going 
    to be you. (walks closer to the girls) I know you're all tired, far away from 
    home, anxious. But you're all special. Most people in this world have no idea 
    why they're here or what they want to do. You do. You have a mission, a reason 
    for being here. You're not here by chance. You're here because you are the 
    chosen ones. (turns, walks upstairs, commenting on the way) Dawn, you better 
    hurry up and eat something so you're not late for school.</p>

    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Buffy's sitting at her desk, talking on the telephone in her cubicle. </b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Xander, I know. I'm sorry—If you're gonna take a shower at my house, 
    lock the door. Of course they're curious. (a student walks up to her cubicle, 
    Buffy gestures and mouths "oh, come in") Hey, I gotta go. Uh, has 
    Giles checked in yet? (Amanda sits in a chair across from Buffy) I thought 
    he was picking up that Chao-Ahn girl in Shanghai yesterday. OK, well, uh, 
    let me know if he does. Bye. (hangs up, sighs) Amanda, right? I'm all yours.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    Do people ever think you're weird?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Um, (flutters eyelashes, shrugs) I guess. Sure, in a charming, endearing, 
    loveable... Yeah.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    I feel like people think I'm weird, and so they pick on me. But I might be—weird.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (chuckles) Amanda, why do you think that you're weird?</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    One of the boys who picks on me, I kind of—See, if a guy picks on you, 
    is it weird to think he's cute?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (grins uncomfortably, leans back in her chair) Oh.. (sighs)</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    It's just, the last few times I've seen him, I've wanted to, you know, pick 
    on him....extra. More.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (stifles a laugh) Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    The thing is, I can't tell. My mom says when a guy teases you, it means he 
    likes you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (nods) Sometimes that's true.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    Is it weird? We're mean to each other, and we like each other.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Well, it depends. Sometimes that's how people relate. Being mean to each other. 
    Even mortal enemies— (increasingly emphatic) Then with the— And 
    that leads to no good, absolutely no good. And much confusion. A-and then 
    it's over. Absolutely, seriously, definitely over. And that's confusing too. 
    The over part. Which it is. Over! (catches herself, calms a bit) So, maybe.</p>

    Buffy comes home through the front door only to find Vi and Rona in a loud 
    discussion with Xander. Andrew's also in the room. Xander appears to be chastising 
    the girls and gesturing emphatically to the destruction that surrounds him. 
    The cushions and chairs are on the floor, furniture is broken—even the 
    pictures on the walls are crooked.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    ...there might be an appropriate place to do that, like maybe outside. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (yelling) Why do we always have to yell?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (crosses her arms and scowls) I was only gone a couple of hours.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (walks in from the dining room) Buffy?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (cocks her head and smirks at the arguers) Oh, look everybody. It's Willow. 
    Perhaps with a blunt weapon of some sort.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Buffy, we just got news. (turns back to the dining room, Buffy follows)</p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    And she's sure?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Positive. Althenea said the seers located another potential slayer here in 
    Sunnydale. Someone that already lives here.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (sighs) Oh, God...</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    All these girls flocking to town, and this one's already here and under our 
    noses?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Wait, the seers couldn't find out her name or, like, her address or anything? 
    Am I getting the definition of <i>seer</i> wrong?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I was gonna take the girls out tonight, a little show and tell, but maybe 
    now I shouldn't.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    They were so excited. (softly) You're gonna break their little hearts.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    This town is lousy with Bringers. I don't want to risk that they find this 
    new girl first.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    No, you should go. I can do a spell to find her tonight. I just have to get 
    together a few ingredients. But you-you shouldn't skip your training, it's 
    too important.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (looks at Willow) You think you can handle it?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    No problemo.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (fidgets in the doorway) Yeah, and you guys have more important things to 
    do.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (doesn't acknowledge Dawn) OK, I'll take 'em.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (pumps his fist) Yes!</p>

    Molly, Vi, and Rona are going through the pile weapons that are laid out on 
    the island countertop.</b></p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    (picks up a crossbow) Ooh, crossbow! Got to love it. (points it around the 
    kitchen) Feels like I'm storming a castle.</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    You do a lot of that, do you?</p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    I might, I had a beauty like this. (Dawn walks into the kitchen, Molly points 
    the crossbow at her) Halt!</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    OK, see, that's why we don't point the weapons in the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    It's not loaded.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    That's always the lead quote under the headline "Household Crossbow Accident 
    Claims Teen".</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    Oh, a mace! (picks up a mace)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (rolls her eyes) Yeah, that's better.</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    (picks up a stake) Gotta go with the stake. It's classic. I like the feel 
    of wood in my hand.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (walks into the kitchen) Lost me there. (sees the pile of weapons) Hey, we 
    gearing up already?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Oh, right. You guys are going on your little group patrol.</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    More than that, it's an outing.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (picks up a dagger, smiling) I'm thinking tonight we might actually get to 
    kill things.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    I-I've killed things sometimes.</p>
<p><i>Buffy walks into the kitchen, followed by Andrew.</i></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (whining) I'm not begging.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You're like a small dog dancing for Snausages.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    You don't want me coming along 'cause you think I'm evil.</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    He doesn't seem evil, exactly.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (crosses her arms) He's not evil, but when he gets close to it, he picks up 
    its flavor like a mushroom or something.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    But I'm reformed. I'm like Vegeta on <u>Dragonball Z</u>. I used to be a pure 
    Sayan, and now I fight for the side of Goku.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (shakes her head) Still not coming.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (whining) It's not fair. Spike just killed people, and he gets to go. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Spike didn't have free will and you did.</p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

<p><i>Rona, Vi, Kennedy and Molly each grab a weapon and follow Buffy and Spike 
    out of the house.</i></p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    All right. Let's do it. I don't know about you guys, but I'm ready to kick

<p><b>25     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Willow, Dawn, and Andrew are gathered around the coffee table, taking inventory 
    of Willow's spell ingredients.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    OK, I got my tumbleweed, my eggs...got my chrysalises—chrysali? My butterfly 
    transformer pods. Hey, wh-where's my snakeskin?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (holding the snakeskin as if it were a live snake and hissing) At your ssssservice, 
    Miss Rosenberg, ssssir. (Willow stares disapprovingly, Andrew hands the skin 
    to her) Can you imagine if every once in a while, people just wriggled out 
    of their skin and left it behind them like—like on the sidewalk. Talk 
    about embarrassing.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (to Willow) Hey, do you think this girl, this potential, goes to Sunnydale?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Hmm. Well, I guess probably, huh? I mean, she's got to be about that age.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Could be anybody. Could be that glamazon in gym class, what's her name? Oh, 
    my lab partner, Margot, the freak. Boy, I hope not, because she totally fainted 
    right in the middle of our fetal pig dissection. Somehow I just don't think 
    she's cut out for the slayage biz.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (pained) Killing pigs is just so wrong. (nods knowingly) And also hard. (Dawn 
    looks at him funny)</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Well, we'll know soon enough who the next potential is. Somebody's life is 
    about to change.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    How long will it take? Will we find out who it is right away?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Pretty much. The spell will conjure up this brilliant light, a-and the light 
    will find the potential and it'll illuminate her with a glowing aura.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Cool.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I've enchanted this map (gestures to a map on the coffee table) so we can 
    track her basic location. We'll have to hot-foot it, but I'm betting we find 
    her tonight.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    You know, if it is Margot, she's so gonna faint.</p>
<p><i>Later now, Willow is sitting in front of the lit fireplace. She's got 
    a mortar and pestle on the hearth and her ingredients are laid out. Dawn, 
    Anya and Xander are also in the room. As she recites the spell, Willow throws 
    each item she mentions into the fire.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    To light the aura of the new, skin of snake and chrysalis too. <br/>
    To indicate the fresh reborn, tumbleweed and rosebush thorn. <br/>
    An egg that means the life to come. <br/>
    Take this, oh spirit, and my spell is done.</p>
<p><i>As Willow finishes the spell recitation, an orange haze emanates from 
    the fireplace. Everyone in the room wrinkles up their noses and starts coughing.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Oh, good God, what is that smell?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (covering her nose with her hand) I'm fairly sure that's the smell of a hardboiled 
    egg being thrown into a fire.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (covering her mouth and nose with her hand) The smell will lead us to the 
    potential.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Or some poor soul who ate too many chimichangas.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    She'll also be lit with a brilliant aura. </p>
<p><i>The orange haze from the fire has gathered in the center of the room, 
    making a mass of glowing light. Willow, Anya, Dawn and Xander are standing 
    in a circle almost, and the light is moving around in the middle of their 
    circle.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Is it supposed to be shimmying all over like that?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I don't know. I don't think so.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    So you messed up the spell again. At least it smells, you know, other-worldly. 
    (Willow looks at her, hurt. Anya realizes this and changes the subject, pointing 
    to the light) Oh, look, pretty.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I suck. I'm sorry, you guys, I— Maybe we could figure something out on 
    the computer?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Good call. I'm gonna open the door and let this place air out. (waves at the 
    air in front of her as she walks to the front door)</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (walks up to Willow, puts his arm around her) Don't worry, Will. It's really 
    no big.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I just—I was sure that it was gonna work. </p>
<p><i>Suddenly, the mass of light congeals and forms into a solid beam and heads 
    straight for Dawn.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Dawn! </p>
<p><i>The light hits Dawn with such a force that it picks her up and pins her 
    to the door. The light goes straight into her, then she drops to the ground, 
    her chest still glowing orange. Somewhat disoriented, Dawn looks at Willow, 
    Xander, and Anya with wide eyes.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (staring at Dawn) I think it worked.</p>

    Resume. Dawn collapses at the door. </b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (goes to her side) Dawn! </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (Willow and Anya step forward) Dawn, are you OK?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (stands, walks into the living room, the others follow) Maybe y-you did it 
    wrong? Was it a-ambiguous in any way? Did you maybe say potential sailors? 
    'Cause I-I do like the water.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I did it right.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (staring at her) Wow, she—you're a potential. You could be the next slayer.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (eyes growing wider) Whoa. (goes to sit on the sofa)</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (kneels in front of her) Wow, it's like one second you were this klutzy teenager 
    with fake memories and a history of kleptomania, and then—then suddenly 
    you're a hero, a hero with a much abbreviated lifespan.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    This is huge. We have to think about this.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    I-I can't think about this. (stands, paces) It doesn't fit in my head.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    A slayer. Makes sense, I guess. Remember that thing about they share the same 
    blood or whatever?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (shrugs) Yeah, I never got that. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    She has to die. (sits on a chair) I mean, if I was ever the slayer, it would 
    mean she died.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Well, it's a lot like being the Pope in that way, except you don't have to 
    be some old Catholic.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I've got to call Buffy. She's gonna be so excited. (goes to the phone)</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (blocks her) No, we can't. She didn't bring a cell phone.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Well, sure, 'cause all the important people are with her.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (points to Dawn) You are important now.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (stands) Wh-wha-what happens now?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Well, you could start by maybe sitting still for a sec.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (paces) I-I cant. I-I need to know what happens to my life.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Well, I guess Buffy trains you.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Right, I train with the potentials—other potentials. Learn to do the 
    stuff they're learning.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Right, we also have to protect you from the, uh, eyeless guys, the ones with 
    the sharp, sharp knives.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Bringers.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    It's OK, we'll protect you.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (worried) What if they saw the spell?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Saw the spell? Dawn, they can't see flashcards. Big ones. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (getting upset) We did a big orange powerful spell. What if they sensed it? 
    What if they're on their way?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (enters the room) Are we gonna replace the microwave? 'Cause I was thinking 
    some Orville Redenbacher with fresh butter flavor— What's going on?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Dawn's gonna be a slayer.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Holy crap! (Xander gives him a look) Excuse me. Plucked from an ordinary life, 
    handed a destiny—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (points at Andrew) Say Skywalker, and I smack ya.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Does Buffy know?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    She didn't take her phone.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Incommunicado.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Well, we'll tell her soon as she gets back.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Let's not.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    What? Dawn, she has to know.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    I-I know, just not right away. Guys, when mom appeared to me, she said—</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Dawnie...</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    No, please. She said something about Buffy, and I'm thinking... I'm just not 
    so sure Buffy will be happy for me.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Of course she will.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Will she? I mean, I'm not even sure I'm happy for me. Everything's different 
    for me now.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    That's because you're a part of something larger. Like being swallowed. By 
    something larger.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (stands) This-this is too much for my head again. (runs upstairs) I can't. 
    I—I need to be—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Nice job with the "getting swallowed" analogy.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Well, it is a mixed bag, you know. If she gets to be the slayer, then her 
    life is short and brutal. And if she doesn't, then it smells of unfulfilled 
    potential. My swallowed analogy looks pretty sweet right now, doesn't it?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    It's not like that. It's like, she's part of this huge power. I know what 
    that feels like. It feels wonderful.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Yes, Willow so captured it. It's like—well, it's almost like this metaphor 
    for womanhood, isn't it? The sort of flowering that happens when a girl realizes 
    that she's part of a fertile heritage stretching back to Eve, and—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (covers his face with his hands, then gestures to Andrew) I'll pay you to 
    talk about Star Wars again.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    This isn't about womany power. This is about the fact that Dawn just might 
    have bought herself an early death.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    We don't know that.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Right, all we know is that everything just changed.</p>

    Buffy and Spike lead the slayers-in-training into the demon bar. The place 
    is dimly lit, filled with disgusting-looking patrons that could never be mistaken 
    for humans. As Buffy and crew walk in, some of the patrons turn to look at

<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    I-I was at school late because of, you know, Swing Choir, and I tore my sweater,

<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    And by the time I was finished, the place was empty, so it was all echoy and

    me, and I kinda dodged it, and it kinda hit its head.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    What kind of thing? </p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    I don't know. It was messed up. In the face. 'Round here abouts. (runs her

    on one of the tables nearest the Bringers, causing a brief explosion and knocking 
    them down. </b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (picks up the jagged broken flagpole) Amanda!</p>
<p><i>Amanda runs away from the Bringers toward Dawn. The girls quickly run 
    out of the room into the hallway.</i></p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>45     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT<br/>
    Amanda and Dawn are running down the hallway. Dawn's still carrying the flagpole 
    shard. They stop running when they get to the top of the stairs.</b></p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    (out of breath) What were those?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Amanda, listen to me. Remember when you said I was special? Well, I'm not. 
    But the thing is, you are. This is your battle, Amanda.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    (shaking her head) No, I can't.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    You can! You've got to. Look, I've got your back, but this is something you 
    have to do. It's something you were born to do. (Bringers have found them 
    and are approaching from the other end of the hall; Dawn hands Amanda the 
    flagpole) Here, this belongs to you.</p>
<p><i>Amanda reluctantly takes the flagpole fragment from Dawn. From the bottom 
    of the stairs, Xander sees Dawn and Amanda talking. He climbs halfway up the 
    stairs and calls below him.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Buffy, up here.</p>
<p><i>Buffy and Spike follow Xander up the stairs toward Dawn and Amanda. As 
    the Bringers come toward Amanda, she uses the flagpole as a staff, knocking 
    them down and defending herself quite well. Dawn manages to stay out of the 
    way and avoid the crossfire. As Amanda knocks the Bringers down, Buffy and 
    Spike go after them on the stairs. </i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (stabs a Bringer with his own knife, then to Spike) Here! (hands the knife 
    to Spike)</p>
<p><i>Spike stabs another Bringer with the knife Buffy gave him. The vampire 
    that attacked Dawn and Amanda in the classroom is there now too, fighting 
    Amanda. She defends herself admirably with the flagpole before ultimately 
    pinning the vampire against the wall and staking him with it. Buffy walks 
    upstairs to the last Bringer that's still alive and breaks his neck. Amanda 
    turns to her, confused and perturbed.</i></p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    (to Buffy) OK. One minute I'm in Swing Choir, and the next— What the 
    hell's going on? You tell me to come to you with problems. Turns out, a vampire 
    attacked me. Problem. So I go to your house, and when I get there, this orange 
    cloud hits me.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (to Xander) She was at the doorway.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    And I don't know if you're into the drugs, but that's not my deal, all right. 
    That cloud hit me, and I got a little dizzy and discombobulated. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    It was Willow's spell. She's the potential slayer.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>46     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Rona, Amanda, and Kennedy are sitting on the couch, talking with Molly, who's 
    on a chair, and Vi who is kneeling on the floor, near the coffee table; together 
    they form a circle.</b></p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    I'm sure the vampire thought we were like, what, four helpless girls. And 
    then Vi—Vi actually yells, "We're just four helpless girls."</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    That was part of my plan. (Kennedy rolls her eyes playfully at Vi)</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    When it all started going down, it was like we knew what we were doing. For 
    real.</p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    (to Rona) Yeah, like when you dodged that first attack, and then cracked him 
    across the jaw.</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    Aw, no, no, no, no, no. (to Molly) See, I wouldn't have been able to do that 
    if you hadn't've pulled his legs out.</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    I hurt his arm. (nods proudly) Yep. And an arm can be as lethal as a mouth.</p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    (to Kennedy) When you staked him, seriously, the rush was like—</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (to Amanda) So you took one out solo?</p>
<p><b>MOLLY</b><br/>
    Yeah, what was that like? </p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    I don't know. I mean, when I saw the vampire, vamp—</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Vampire's good too.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    Cool. Yeah, when that vampire attacked me, I felt this kind of charge, you 
    know?</p>
<p><i>Dawn's standing on the periphery of the room, watching them talk. Her 
    arms are crossed and she's pouting a little.</i></p>
<p><b>KENNEDY (O.S.)</b><br/>
    Like you realize in one instant that your whole life is different.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA (O.S.)</b><br/>
    Exactly. It's that rush you're talking about. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (walks up to Dawn from the kitchen, followed by Xander) Hey. (Dawn turns to 
    face her, puts on a happy face) You OK? </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (nods) Yeah, I was thinking of hitting the books. Do some research on The 
    First. It's in retreat mode right now, but you're still gonna need to know 
    how to fight it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (nods) Great. Sounds good. (to the slayers-in-training) Hey, you guys, wanna 
    head downstairs? Get our newest arrival up to speed?</p>
<p><i>The girls all stand and follow Buffy out of the room. As each slayer-in-training 
    passes by Dawn, they don't look at her, don't acknowledge her at all, until 
    Amanda walks by. Amanda pauses for a second and looks at Dawn, smiles, and 
    then continues to follow the other girls. After the girls have gone, Dawn 
    sits down at the desk, opens a book and starts to read it. Then she notices 
    that Xander hasn't left the room but is standing behind her, watching her.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (looking over her shoulder, to Xander) What's up?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (walks into the room) Aw, I'm just thinking about the girls. It's a harsh 
    gig, being a potential. Just being picked out of a crowd, danger, destiny, 
    (grins) plus if you act now, death.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    They can handle it.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Yeah. (sits in a chair in front of the desk) They're special, no doubt. The 
    amazing thing is, not one of them will ever know, not even Buffy. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Know what?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    How much harder it is for the rest of us. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    No way. They've got—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Seven years, Dawn. Working with the slayer. Seeing my friends get more and 
    more powerful. A witch. A demon. Hell, I could fit Oz in my shaving kit, but 
    come a full moon, he had a wolfy mojo not to be messed with. Powerful. All 
    of them. And I'm the guy who fixes the windows. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Well, you had that sexy army training for a while, and—and the windows 
    really did need fixing.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    I saw what you did last night.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Yeah, I— (shakes her head embarrassed) I guess I kinda lost my head when 
    I thought I was the slayer.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    You thought you were all special. Miss Sunnydale 2003. And the minute you 
    found out you weren't, you handed the crown to Amanda without a moment's pause. 
    You gave her your power.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (shrugs) The power wasn't mine.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie, to be the one who isn't chosen. 
    To live so near to the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more 
    than anybody realizes because nobody's watching me. I saw you last night. 
    I see you working here today. You're not special. You're extraordinary. (stands, 
    kisses her forehead, stands to walk out of the room)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (tears welling in her eyes, calls after him) Maybe that's your power.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (pauses at the door) What?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Seeing. Knowing.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Maybe it is. Maybe I should get a cape. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Cape is good. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Yeah. (leaves the room) </p>
<p><i>Dawn gathers herself together, never letting a tear drop. She breathes 
    deeply, then goes back to work on the books at her desk.</i></p>
