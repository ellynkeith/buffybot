<h3>TEASER (RECAP SEGMENT):</h3>
<p><b>GILES (V.O.)</b><br/>
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:</p>
<p><b>1     INT.     FOYER 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy and Spike talk near the front door. While Spike talks, show shots of 
    foreign girls being killed.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I'm just a guy with his ear to the ground, but even I can feel it. Something's 
    coming. I don't know what exactly, but something's brewing. And it's so big, 
    ugly and damned it makes you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces. 
  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>1a EXT.     CITY STREET IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY 
      - NIGHT<br/>
      A dark-haired girl is running through the arched hallway, looking over her 
      shoulder and panting from the exertion of running so fast. She's being chased. 
      Two people in hooded cloaks are chasing her. Two hooded figures hold her 
      down, and a third figure raises an arched, shiny, silver dagger and thrusts 
      down at her.</i></p>
<p><i>1b INT.     PARKING GARAGE IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY 
      - NIGHT<br/>
      A girl with hot pink hair with black bangs at her forehead, a nose ring, 
      and a metal collar is trying to escape her pursuers. Finally, she thinks 
      she's safe when she goes through a doorway to the outside near a crowd of 
      club patrons, but she is pushed back inside. Robed men close the door behind 
      them and start to fight with her. She is knocked to the ground, lying on 
      her back. Finally, one of the robed people pulls out a curved silver dagger 
      and stabs her.</i></p>

<p><b>2     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - NIGHT<br/>
    Xander's showing his apartment to his new roommate, seeming somewhat peeved.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    You're gonna live in that small room over there. I know it looks like a closet, 
    but it's a room now. (to Buffy) And I hate this plan. I just don't understand 
    when his problems became your problems—more specifically mine. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    The school basement is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there. It's 
    just—things are different now—he has a soul.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>3     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Dawn's alone at home. The power's out. She's standing in the middle of the 
    living room, looking around. </b></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Mom? </p>
<p><i>A flash, and Joyce is lying on the couch screaming while a dark shadowy 
    figure is choking her as she reaches out toward Dawn.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Get off her and let her talk to me!</p>
<p><i>The noise and wind stop. Blood spatters all the walls, but then fades 
    and disappears altogether. The house is still a complete wreck, but still 
    now. Dawn whimpers and collapses. A golden light fills the room. Dawn looks 
    up and sees a vision of Joyce standing there in front of her, beautiful and 
    glowing, wearing a long white gown. Dawn manages to push herself up on her 
    arms and sit up. </i></p>
<p><b>JOYCE</b><br/>
    Things are coming, Dawn. When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you.</p>
<p><i>The vision of Joyce starts to fade. </i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    No! </p>

    SUNNYDALE LIBRARY - NIGHT<br/>
    Willow's standing, and Cassie's standing on the other side of the library 
    table. While Cassie talks, show shots of Spike's activities.</b></p>
<p><b>CASSIE</b><br/>
    (serious, leans in) You don't know hurt. This last year's gonna seem like 
    cake after what I put you and your friends through, and I am not a fan of 
    easy death. Fact is, the whole good-versus-evil, balancing the scales thing—I'm 
    over it. But believe me, I'm going for a big finish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>4a INT. BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT<br/>
      Spike's nursing his whiskey at the bar, when a blonde woman in a faux-fur 
      trimmed jean jacket puts down a pack of cigarettes on the bar in front of 
      him. He raises his eyebrows, turns to look at her and nods to the stool 
      beside him. She sits down next to him. </i></p>
<p><i>4b EXT. SUNNYDALE NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT<br/>
      Spike's walking down a neighborhood street beside the girl he met at the 
      bar. They're smiling and talking and seem to be having fun.</i></p>
<p><i>4c EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT<br/>
      Spike's walking the young woman to the apartment building. She starts walking 
      up the staircase and gestures that he follow. Spike stands still, though, 
      keeping his hands in his pockets, rocking on his heels. She comes back down 
      the stairs and stands close to him.</i></p>
<p><i>4d EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT<br/>
      Holding the young woman in an embrace, Spike rears back in vampire face 
      and sinks his fangs into her neck. He drinks deeply, but she doesn't struggle 
      much and barely makes a sound.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    From beneath you, it devours.</p>
<p><i>Cassie sports a wicked grin, and then her skin rolls back, and her jaws 
    flip back and she's turning inside out until she's a floating ball of flesh, 
    then—poof!—she disappears altogether. Willow's left just standing 
    there in front of the library table. </i></p>

    What do you mean? How do you know Spike?</p>
<p><b>HOLDEN</b><br/>
    What do you mean, how? He was the guy that, um—oh, what's the word?</p>

<h3>Prologue:</h3>
<p><b>7     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - NIGHT<br/>
    There's a knocking at the front door. Xander comes out of his bedroom, groggy 
    and grouchy. The knocking continues.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (sighs) OK, OK, I'm coming. I'm up. It's 4:30 in the morning. Sweet mamalooshin. 
    (through door) Who is it?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It's me. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (opens door) Buffy?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (walks inside hurriedly) Where's Spike?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Spike?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Spike. Xander, is he here?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    No, he's out. At least he was when I got home.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Any idea where he went?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    I don't know, creature of the night, Buff. He's probably out creaturing. (Buffy 
    looks out the window) Why, what happened? Is he in trouble?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I hope not.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>8     INT.     BASEMENT 
    - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike's humming a song to himself, digging a hole in the dirt basement floor. 
    He stops, dusts off his hands and looks down. Pan over to show the young woman 
    he killed in the previous episode. He grabs her up by her jacket collar, looks 
    her in the face, and callously throws her into the grave. He buries her in 
    the dirt, still humming.</b></p>
<p><b>Fade to black.</b></p>
<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>9     INT.     FLAT 
    IN ENGLAND - DAY<br/>
    A middle-aged man comes into his apartment, reading a book. When he looks 
    up, he notices that the place has been broken into. There's a broken flower 
    vase, plus furniture is disarranged. </b></p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>
    Nora? Nora?</p>
<p><i>He walks into the next room and sees a teenage girl lying on the floor, 
    apparently stabbed in the back. She's not moving. The man looks stunned momentarily, 
    then someone cloaked in a full-length hooded black robe tries to stab him 
    with a silver curved dagger. The man's reflexes are quick, though, and he 
    blocks with his briefcase. He runs to grab a sword from his collection, but 
    is attacked from behind by another robed person. He falls to the ground, landing 
    next to the young girl.</i></p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>10     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Willow comes home hurriedly through the front door.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Buffy? (starts to go upstairs)</p>
<p><i>From the living room, Dawn answers. She's sitting on the floor in front 
    of the couch, hugging a pillow, amid the destruction from her earlier encounter.</i></p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    She's not here. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Dawn? Oh my God. (goes to her side) What're you— Dawn, what happened 
    here? What— You're cut.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    I'm all right. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Let me see, make sure. (turns her face to inspect it)</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    I saw Mom.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    What?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    She was here, Willow. I saw her. She was here, and she spoke to me.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Oh, sweetie.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    No, she was right here, and—and then she wasn't. She—</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    It wasn't her.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    What?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    At least, I don't think. I-I saw something too, and it looked like... someone 
    else, but it wasn't.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    I don't understand.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    But, that's what she said. Mom, she said that things were coming, that things 
    were on their way, and that she loves us. So, it had to be her, right? I mean, 
    her warning was true.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (shakes head) I don't know. I just don't think we can trust anything right 
    now.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    So maybe the evil thing messing with you was here too. Only maybe it was the 
    thing trying to keep mom away. 'Cause she was trying to protect me. Maybe.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>11     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - NIGHT<br/>
    Xander's making himself a cup of coffee while chatting with Buffy.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Why would a vampire lie about who sired him. What's that? Some kind of status 
    symbol for the undead. My sire can beat up your sire. (sits) </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I'm not saying I don't believe him.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    You just don't want to. OK, let's look at this objectively. Figure it out 
    in a cold, impersonal, CSI-like manner 'cause we're a couple of carpet fibers 
    away from a case. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Spike can't be the one doing this. He couldn't if he wanted to.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Why not? </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Well, for one thing, pain chip, remember? He can't hurt anyone.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Didn't stop him from hurting you. (Buffy looks away) Hey, objective here. 
    Maybe the chip's not working anymore.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Oh, it's working. I've seen it.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Is it? Or is that what Spike wants you to think?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You think it's an act?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    I don't really know. And neither do you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, mm-mmm. There's something. I-I can feel it. He's different. He's changed. 
    And, if it is an act, then the Oscar goes to...</p>
<p><i>Spike comes in the front door, and Buffy and Xander both stare at him. 
    He stops in his tracks.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Well, this can't be good. You here at this hour. There trouble?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, no trouble. I was just— Uh, we were just—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (nods) Right. (shuts door) None of my business. No worries. (starts walking 
    to his room)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (walks up to him) Spike, I— How was your night?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    'S all right. And yours? Did you, uh, bag any baddies?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    One. Vampire. Uh, someone I used to know, actually, a little. Holden. Holden 
    Webster.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    You knew him, huh? (walks closer to her) That must've been a picnic.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Yeah.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Well, I'm gonna turn in before I drop. (goes to his room) G'night. (closes 
    door behind him)</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (stands) You see that? You see how he reacted when you mentioned Webs? Cool 
    as Cool Whip. What's up with that?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    The sun's coming up. I need to get home and check on Dawn. We need to keep 
    an eye on Spike.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Whoa, whoa, whoa. When you say we you mean me. And me's gotta go to work. 
    I got a big client meeting in a couple of hours. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Xander, this is serious. We cannot let him leave this house until we know 
    if he's killing again. We need to find someone that can watch him.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>11     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - DAY<br/>
    Anya's at Xander's apartment, and she's a little upset with him. Xander's 
    opening all the blinds in the living room area.</b></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Uh-uh. Forget it, Harris.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Come on, Anya. You said you'd do it on the phone.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Yeah, but that— (lowers her voice) That was before you told me Spike's 
    killing again, and now you want me to be alone with him?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    You didn't mind being alone with him before.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    What was that?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Nothing. Look, we don't actually know that he's killed anyone. You know, lately. 
    Might all just be a mistake.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Yeah, but you don't think so. OK, have you searched his room for clues? Trophies 
    from victims? Killers like to keep trophies sometimes. Scalps, necklaces made 
    from human teeth.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    You know, it didn't occur to me to look, but thanks for the tip. OK, so you'll 
    be safe in here. Plenty of sunlight for you to hide in. (tries to leave)</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (follows him) What? That's it? You're not at least gonna like leave me a crossbow 
    or a flame thrower? Something to protect myself?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    We don't want him to know we suspect anything. Besides if he tries to leave, 
    I don't want you confronting him. Call Buffy and just let her know that he's 
    on the move. You're gonna be fine. (grabs his hard hat and briefcase) </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Better be, because if I get vamped, I'm gonna bite your ass.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (walks out the door) Wouldn't be the first time. (smiles, closes door)</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    What was that?</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>12     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Willow's quietly closing the door to Dawn's room. Buffy runs up the stairs 
    yelling.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Dawn? Dawn!</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (softly) Buffy, it's OK. She's OK. Not hurt. She's just exhausted. Finally 
    fell off to sleep.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What the hell happened? Downstairs looks like—</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Hell happened? Yeah. This big evil that's been promising to devour us—well 
    I think it's started chomping. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Oh, God. And it started with Dawn?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Both of us. Buffy, this thing knows us. It made us think that we were talking 
    to people we knew. Mine said it came with a message from Tara. But Dawn actually 
    saw... your Mother. This thing—it had me for a while—I mean, before 
    it started letting loose with the pulse-pounding terror. But before that, 
    the lies were very convincing. It just seems real.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Lies. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I mean maybe—maybe to confuse us, to mess us up. Or maybe just to be 
    cool.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Vampire I killed last night told me Spike sired him—two nights ago.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Well, that's impossible, right? So maybe it was another one. A fake-out. You 
    got one too. It wasn't a real vamp.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It dusted real enough.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Buffy, do you think Spike is—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I can't. (sighs) I hope not. But if I'm wrong and he is, then I have to see 
    it for myself. I have to be there to stop it.</p>

<h3>ACT II:</h3>
<p><b>13     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - DAY<br/>
    Anya's at Xander's apartment, and she's sitting on the couch near the windows 
    in the living room area. The sun's not shining as brightly through the windows. 
    Anya's staring at Spike's door. She stands, sighs, and saunters closer to 
    it. </b></p>

<p><b>14     INT.     SPIKE'S 
    ROOM AT XANDER'S APARTMENT - DAY<br/>
    Anya sneaks into Spike's room quietly, holding a stake in her hand. Spike's 
    sleeping shirtless in the bed. She sneaks over to his dresser and goes through 
    each drawer looking for something. The shot shows that Spike's wearing nothing 
    under the sheets. Anya goes through his pants which are on the bed, then through 
    his shirt which is on the floor. He rolls over, and she continues rifling 
    through his stuff. He wakes and grabs her wrist. She's frozen in panic. </b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Anya, do be specific and tell a fellow just exactly what you're doing here. 
  </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Well, Spike... I'm here, obviously... for...um...sex. </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (sits up, retracts) Uh, beg pardon.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (kneels beside bed, holding stake) You and me. Here and now. Let's go. Let's... 
    get it on, you big bad boy.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Wait, wait, Anya. Just a minute. This is not exactly—is that a stake?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Yes. Kinky. (puts the stake down)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Uh, well, yeah, but what do you—?</p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Oh, God!</p>
<p><i>Buffy fights the vampires, who have taken tools from the basement to fight 
    her with. Spike-2 is talking to Spike.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE-2</b><br/>
    You know what I want you to do. </p>
<p><i>Buffy continues to fight the vampires, but they manage to get a hold on 
    her, one on each arm, holding her up for Spike. </i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE-2</b><br/>
    They're waiting for you. Take her, taste her, make her weak.</p>
<p><i>Spike stands, and walks toward Buffy menacingly.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Spike, no!</p>
<p><i>Spike puts his face near hers, on each side of her neck, but opts to suck 
    from her open shoulder wound he created earlier by cutting her with the glass. 
    As he mouths her, he flashes back to all the things he's done—killing, 
    burying, and all the rest.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (in human face) I remember. </p>
<p><i>Spike's horrified. His face is one of complete shock and disbelief that 
    he could have actually done those things. He recoils from Buffy, staggering 
    back to the far end of the room. Buffy fights her way free of the vampires' 
    grip. She uses the wooden handle of a garden tool to stake the vampires. Meanwhile, 
    Spike's hiding in a cubbyhole at the back end of the basement, covering his 
    head with his hands. Spike-2 is crouched near him, talking to him.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE-2</b><br/>
    You failed them. Now she's gonna kill you. You lose, mate.</p>
<p><i>An elderly vampire is having difficulty rising from the grave, only able 
    to get her hand out of the dirt. Buffy grabs her hand, pulls her up, and stakes 
    her. </i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Sorry, ma'am, but it's my job.</p>
<p><i>Buffy walks over to Spike, still carrying the wooden handle. She stands 
    in front of him. He looks at her, knowing his fate, and scoots out of the 
    cubbyhole he was hiding in. He holds open his shirt. He's crying.</i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Do it fast, OK? He said you'd do it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Who said?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Me. It was me. I saw it. I was here the whole time, talking and singing. (sobs) 
    There was a song.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I don't know. Please, I don't remember. Don't make me remember. (to invisible 
    person) Make it so I forget again! I did what you wanted!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    There's something here. (throws away the wooden tool handle)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Oh, God, no, please. I need that. I can't cry the soul out of me. It won't 
    come. I killed, and I can feel 'em. I can feel every one of them.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    There's something playing with us. All of us. </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    What is it? Why is it doing this to me?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I don't know. </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Will you... Help me. Can you help me?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I'll help you.</p>
<p><i>Spike-2 is still watching from the staircase. He sighs and sneers, seeming 
    disappointed.</i></p>

<p><b>29     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike is sitting in a chair, wrapped in a blanket while the others talk in 
    an adjacent room. Buffy, Xander, Anya, Willow and Dawn are all there. Spike's 
    listening to them.</b></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    And you believe him?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    You didn't see him down there. He really didn't know what he'd done. It wasn't 
    in his control.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Oh, an out of control serial killer. You're right, that is a great houseguest.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Wait, is he—is he staying here?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I don't know. But I'm not letting him out of my sight, that's for sure.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Buffy, he's been feeding... on human blood. That's gotta do stuff.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I'm not keeping him around just to help him. I think there was something there, 
    talking to him, making him do things. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Something like what was talking to us?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Maybe. But if it was, it's been screwing with Spike big time.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    So, you want him around because...?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Look, there's something evil working us, and if we are ever gonna have a chance 
    to fight it, we need to learn everything we can about it. This thing has been 
    closer to Spike than any of us.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    And if you want to understand it....</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I'm gonna have to get close to Spike.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Nah, it's too dangerous.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I don't have a choice. Whatever this thing is, from beneath us, it's bad, 
    and it's only getting worse. </p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>30     INT.     FLAT 
    IN ENGLAND - DAY<br/>
    Giles enters the flat, looking around. He sees the young woman lying dead 
    on the floor. </b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Oh, dear God! Robson, are you here? Robson!</p>
<p><i>Giles gets up and starts looking for Robson, who's found near a chair 
    in the next room. Giles goes to his side.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    You too? (takes off his glasses and starts to cry) Dear God, I thought you—</p>
<p><b>ROBSON</b><br/>
    (eyes flash open) Gather them. It's started.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    It's all right. I understand. I'll take care of it—</p>
<p><i>One of the robed men sneaks up behind Giles wielding a battle-axe. He 
    swings it at Giles.</i></p>
