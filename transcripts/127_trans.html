<h3>Prologue:</h3>
<p><b>8      INT.    BUFFY'S OLD 
    BEDROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Dawn is helping Willow unpack her things. She's moving in to Buffy's old room. 
    </b></p>
<p><b>DAWN<br/>
</b>My advice to you is do exactly what everyone else does all the time. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Got it. </p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Do what everyone else does, wear what everyone else wears, say what everyone 
  else says.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  OK.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    People may say something to you you don't understand. Just don't be afraid 
    to keep your mouth shut and pretend like you know what they're saying.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (laughs) You know, Dawn, I've been to college before.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  People may say something like "My protein window closes in an hour." 
  Just nod and smile. Mm-hmm. Turns out it has something to do with fitness.</p>
<p><i>Buffy and Xander enter the room, carrying boxes.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Have you talked to her lately?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Not since that night with the Gnarl demon. And that wasn't exactly the kind 
  of "how have you been" kind of talk. More of the "pierce its 
  eye with something sharp" kind of talking. I'm thinking I should call her.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I just don't want you to get your hopes up.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Hopes? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There are no hopes. Anya and I are done. I love 
  being single. I'm a strong, successful male who is giddy at the thought of all 
  the women I will no doubt be dating in the near future.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Strong, successful males say "giddy"?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I just worry about her, that's all.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Anya?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Yeah, she seems so sad.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  She should try acting like everybody else more.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Apparently it's what all the kids are doing nowadays.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Well, I'm not sure I get the sad vibe, but there's definitely a vengeance vibe 
  worth worrying about. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Oh, that? No, no. I don't worry about that. She was hurt and she just turned 
  back to what she knew when I— you know. But that's not her anymore.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I hope you're right.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Well, she turned that worm guy back before any real damage happened, right? 
    It'll just take some time. I really think she's coming around.</p> <p><b>Cut to:</b></p>

<p><b>10      INT.    RUSTIC MEDIEVAL 
    HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    A long-haired brunette Anya is holding a cute brown bunny. Olaf walks in and 
    starts talking to her in swedish language (dialogue shown below is subtitled). 
    He's wearing leather and animal skins. Anya is in a dress.</b></p>
<p><b>TITLE CARD: Sjornjost, 880.</b></p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
    Aud! Sweet, beautiful Aud! I am so hungry, I could eat a small child!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Olaf! Are you injured? You smell of blood and musk. </p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
  Fear not! It takes more than a band of minor trolls to bring down the mighty 
  Olaf!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Trolls!</p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
  Oh! They are wretched creatures indeed. The mere thought of them makes me bend 
  at the knee and flex! (does a muscleman pose)</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Sweetheart, please sit down. Allow me to tend to you.</p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
  I am fine. Really. I could go for some mead, though.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Certainly.</p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
    (looking around the room) Is it my imagination, or do we have substantially 
    more rabbits in this house today?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Oh, they breed so quickly that it's—</p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
  All this talk of breeding... it makes me want to breed!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Honey, of course. But here—drink your mead first.</p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
  Ah, yes. Mead.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  The rapid reproductive rate of our rabbits...has given me an idea. I can give 
  the excess out to the townspeople, exchanging them not for goods or services, 
  but for goodwill and the sense of accomplishment that stems from selflessly 
  giving of yourself to others.</p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
  Ha, ha, ha! Sweet Aud! Your logic is insane and happenstance, like that of a 
  troll. It is no wonder that the bar matrons talk of you. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  You've been to the bar...</p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
  (sighs) It is not my fault they don't take kindly to you. You speak your mind, 
  and are annoying. It's one of the things I love most about you.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Was Rannveig there?</p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
  Bah! I've told you a thousand times; I have no interest in this Rannveig. Her 
  hips are large and load bearing, like a Baltic woman. Your hips are narrow, 
  like a Baltic woman from a slightly more arid region. You are my perfect Aud. 
  I could never want for another.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I am sorry. I simply love you so much...I feel as though I could burst at times...I 
  could not live without you.</p>
<p><b>OLAF</b><br/>
  Fear not, sweet Aud, you will always be my beautiful girl.</p>

    Spike is sitting on the floor with his back to a chain link fence that's separating 
    one area from another. He seems rather substantially more coherent and mentally 
    stable than he's seemed recently, and definitely more sound than he's ever 
    seemed in the basement.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I don't trust what I see anymore. I don't know how to explain it, exactly. It's 
  like I've been seeing things. (pan over to show he's talking to Buffy) Dru used 
  to see things, you know? She'd always be staring up at the sky watching cherubs 
  burn or the heavens bleed or some nonsense. I used to stare at her and think 
  she'd gone completely sack of hammers. But she'd see the sky when we were inside 
  and it'd make her so happy. She'd see showers. She'd see stars. Now I see her.</p>
<p><i>Buffy's wearing a white shirt and an open, non-judgmental face.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (compassionate and patient) Spike.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I'm in trouble, Buffy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I can help you.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I could never ask. Not after...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It's different. You're different.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I could never ask.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Spike, it's me. It's you and it's me, and we'll get through this.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Never...</p>
<p><i>Spike's nervously got his hand behind his ear, and Buffy reached to hold 
    his hand.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  We'll get through this. </p>

    a scowl. Spike is still sitting huddled on the floor. Alone. He seems crazy 
    again now.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Spike. (he looks up, surprised) This basement is killing you. This is the 
    hellmouth. There is something bad down here, possibly everything bad.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (laughs) Can't hear you. Can't hear you. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You have a soul? Fine. Show me.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Scream montresor all you like, pet.</p>

  I was concerned—</p>

  Oh, I'm starting back up at school again! Yeah, I can't believe how great everyone's

  that I missed, and... Wh-what're you doing here? (confused) Walking out of the

    around, the house is eerily empty. She walks in further to investigate, and 
    there are blood stains everywhere, on the walls, door, and floor. When she 
    opens the door to an adjacent room, what she sees horrifies her. She hears 
    a high-pitched whimper from another room, and goes to investigate. It's coming 
    from a closet. Willow opens it to see a young woman in there crying and rocking 
    in fetal position. She also has blood on her clothes. </i></p>

    Resume. Anya and D'Hoffryn are talking.</b></p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  I get the sense that your talents are not fully appreciated here, Anyanka. We'd 
  like you to join us.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Why do you keep calling me that? My name is Aud.</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  Perhaps, but Anyanka is who you are.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  What would I have to do?</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
    What you do best. Help wronged women punish evil men.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Vengeance.</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  But only to those who deserve it.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  They all deserve it.</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  That's where I was going with that, yeah.</p>

    Buffy's at her desk, wearing the same black shirt she wore in the basement. 
    Buffy is clearly bored, as evidenced by her balancing a pencil holder full 
    of pencils on her forehead. The phone rings and breaks her conversation, causing 
    her to jump and spill the pencils. She answers the phone.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Hello. Willow, hey! Is everything— A spider demon? Wh— h-hold on. A-are you 
  all right? Like how? (grabs paper to write something down) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Wait, 
  OK, go ahead. No, no, no, no, no. It's all good. I'll get Xander to go. But 
  seriously, you just— Whoa. Ripped out the heart? My God. Hey, did you get that 
  physics class you wanted?</p>

    Halfrek is sitting on couch visiting, talking to Anya.</b></p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
    This is just wonderful, Anyanka. There's even talk of having some sort of 
    ceremony. I can't tell you how many times today I've heard "Anyanka is 
    back to her old self again." (Anya looks troubled) Honey, what is it? 
    What's wrong?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    It's nothing. I just— There was just so much screaming, so much blood. 
    (Hallie smiles, imagining it) I— I forgotten how much damage a Grimslaw 
    demon could do.</p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  Oh, tell me about it. They can be feisty little guys and impossible to house 
  train. I mean, once they start nesting, forget— Are you OK? Oh, did something 
  happen?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I-I guess I'm just a little rusty. I didn't think it would hit me like this. 
</p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  Oh, sweetie. This is perfectly normal. It's a reflex. You'll get over it in 
  no time, trust me.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Oh, Hallie! I can't tell you how good it is— Thank goodness you're here. </p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  Oh, sweetie. Of course.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  It's just lately, with everything that's been going on, I-I've had trouble even

    you? (takes teacups into kitchen) It was a game. They were humiliating her.

    Buffy and Xander are walking through the woods on a trail, looking for the 
    spider demon. Xander is carrying a sword, and Buffy has her battle-axe.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Thanks for side-kicking. I didn't want to trouble Willow. Figure she's got enough 
  to do. First day back and all.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Are you kidding? We're doing vent work at the site. Anything's better than breathing 
  freon for eight hours. (beat) So, did she say what this thing is?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Some sort of spider demony thingy. She had to go pretty quickly. I think she 
  had to sign up for classes or something.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Ah, yes, there is little that can distract the Willow when she's on the hunt 
  for the mighty syllabi.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I don't know. I guess she was a little more nervous than she was letting on.</p>
<p><i>They stumble across a boy's body. The heart has been ripped out. Xander 
    starts hyperventilating.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  How big did she say this thing was?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  She didn't. But I can't imagine she'd send us out if it wasn't— The heart is 
  completely ripped out. This is our guy.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Or a copycat spider demon. So what's this black stuff?</p>
<p><i>There's black stringy things hanging on the nearby tree. Xander touches 
    it.</i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Aw, it's sticky!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Willow said it was a spider demon. Maybe it's its webbing.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  This isn't springy high-flying fun.</p>
<p><i>A noise comes from the tree above them, like something's moving around in 
    it.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (looking up) Xander.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Is that it?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I can't tell. There is definitely something moving up there. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Maybe we can somehow lure it.</p>
<p><i>One of the sticky black webs is shot down from the tree, landing on Xander's 
    shoulder. He dives out of the way. </i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Xander!</p>
<p><i>The spider jumps out of the tree, knocks Buffy down to the ground, and 
    lands on top of her. She squirms, but can't get free, as the spider demon's 
    second mouth comes out to try and bite her face. She pushes it off, and it 
    scurries away. She grabs her battle-axe off the ground and looks up in the 
    tree for the spider demon.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  You OK?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Buffy, where'd it go? I think we need more swords.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (still looking up into the tree) Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I say we go home, pick up more swords, and some sort of spidery demon protection 
  amulet. We come back, and—</p>
<p><i>Buffy who has never stopped tracking the spider demon in the tree, throws 
    her battle-axe up into the treetop. The spider falls to the ground with the

    Xander and Buffy come home covered in huge scrapes and gashes. </b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I'm more concerned with where that thing came from. If there are more of those 
  spider demons running around, we need to know about it. We should hit the research, 
  find out if—</p>
<p><i>Buffy and Xander walk into the living room to see Willow is waiting for 
    them.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I know where it came from.</p>
<p><i>Buffy and Xander sit down beside each other on the couch, facing Willow 
    who's in the chair.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  How many?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Ten, twelve.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  When were you planning on telling us?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I'm telling you now.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Great. Thank you. Willow, it's Anya. How could you let us— How could you not 
  have told us? </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Xander...</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  How could you not have told me?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Xander. It's OK. She didn't tell us for a reason. She didn't tell us because 
  she knows what I have to do. (Xander looks from Willow to Buffy) I have to kill 
  Anya. </p>

    showing a battle going on outside. The girls are wearing Victorian outfits 
    with the feathered hats and elaborate jewelry, etc. and sipping champagne.</b></p>
<p><b>TITLE CARD: St. Petersburg, 1905.</b></p>

<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Oh, stop. </p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  Oh, I will not. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I grant wishes. It's all inside the girl. I just bring it out.</p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  Yes, I'm sure this is what she had in mind.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Well, I don't know about her mind, but it was in her heart. Besides, Russia 
  was ready to explode. All we did is just give it a little push.</p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  What should we do with the rest of our evening? I hear they're going to raze 
  the Winter Mansion.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Well, I thought we'd head on down to Madame Dubasov's. No better spot for vengeance 
  than a brothel.</p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  Oh, it's always work, work, work with you.</p>
<p><i>A man comes into the room on fire, and the girls don't even flinch. They 
    just carry on their conversations without noticing him or helping him.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Well, of course. What else is there?</p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  What else is there? Why, the whole world, for one. Darling, take a look around. 
  There's a lot to see. There's a revolution going on outside that you are somewhat 
  responsible for. Aren't you the teeniest bit interested?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Well, what is there to be interested in? The worker will overthrow absolutism 
  and lead the proletariat to a victorious communist revolution, resulting in 
  socio-economic paradise on earth. It's common sense, really. I have better things 
  to worry about.</p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  But, Anyanka, there's a whole world out there.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Yes, filled with wronged women who need my help.</p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  Oh, but you're talking work. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I'm talking about life. Vengeance is what I do, Halfrek. I don't need anything 
  else. Vengeance is what I am. </p>

<p><b>24      INT.    LIVING ROOM 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Resume conversation about Buffy killing Anya. Xander, Willow, and Buffy are 
    talking.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  She's not the Anya that you knew, Xander. She's a demon.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  That doesn't mean you have to kill her.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Don't act like this is easy for me. You know it's not.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  There are other options. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I've considered them.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  When? Just now? Took you all of ten seconds to decide to kill one of your best 
  friends?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  The thought that it might come to this has occurred to me before. It's occurred 
  to you, too.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  But we can change what she did. Fix it. These are mystical deaths, right? There 
  has to be something. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I don't have anywhere near that kind of power. I didn't have that kind of power 
  when— And I-I don't think I trust the power I do have. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (to Willow) It's OK. (turns to Xander) Xander, I know this is hard for you 
    to hear, but it's what I have to do. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Hard for me to hear? Buffy, you wanna kill Anya!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I don't want to.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Then don't! This isn't new ground for us. When our friends go all crazy and 
  start killing people, we help them. (looks at Willow)</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Sitting right here.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I'm sorry. But it's true. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It's different.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Because you don't care about her the same way I do. Buffy, I still love her.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I know. And that's why you can't see this for what it really is. Willow was 
    different. She's a human. Anya's a demon.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  And you're the slayer. I see now how it's all very simple.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It is never simple.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (stands) No, of course not. You know, if there's a mass-murdering demon that 
  you're, oh, say, boning, then it's all gray area. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Spike was harmless. He was helping.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  He had no choice. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  And Anya did! She chose to become a demon. Twice.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  You have no idea what she's going through.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (stands) I don't care what she's going through!</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  No, of course not. You think we haven't seen all this before? The part where 
  you just cut us all out. Just step away from everything human and act like you're 
  the law. If you knew what I felt—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I killed Angel! Do you even remember that? I would have given up everything 
  I had to be with— I loved him more than I will ever love anything in this life. 
  And I put a sword through his heart because I had to. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  And that all worked out OK. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Do you remember cheering me on? Both of you. Do you remember giving me Willow's 
  message: Kick his ass.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  I never said that—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  This is different—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It is always different! It's always complicated. And at some point, someone 
  has to draw the line, and that is always going to be me. You get down on me 
  for cutting myself off, but in the end the slayer is always cut off. There's 
  no mystical guidebook. No all-knowing council. Human rules don't apply. There's 
  only me. I am the law. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  There has to be another way.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Then please find it.</p>

  What's the point of losing your heart?<br/>

  Maybe you're not losing at all. (opens blanket) <br/>
  No need to cover up my heart, (spreads blanket on Xander)<br/>

  Welcome him with kisses<br/>
  'Cause this is a Missis who misses her man<br/>
  He's my Xander<br/>
  And he's awfully swell<br/>
  It makes financial sense as well,<br/>
  Although he can be—I'll never tell—<br/>
  Just stand aside<br/>
  Here comes the bride (goes through balcony door, and is suddenly in wedding 
  gown)<br/>
  I'll be Missis.<br/>
  I will be his Missis<br/>
  I will be—</p>

<p><b>29      INT.    FRAT HOUSE 
    AT U.C. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT<br/>
    Resume. Buffy has just stabbed Anya through the heart with her sword. Anya, 
    in human face, is slumped, but hasn't fallen. Xander regains consciousness 
    and is still on the floor. He looks over and sees Anya's condition.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Anya!</p>
<p><i>Anya face is tear-streaked and bloody. Suddenly, she gasps for air and opens 
    her eyes. She looks down at the sword in her chest.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Forgotten how much swords through the chest hurt. (pulls it out) Aaahh! (breathes 
    heavily) You know better than that, Buffy. It takes a lot more to kill a vengeance 
    demon.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Oh, I'm just getting started. </p>
<p><i>Anya comes at Buffy with the sword. Buffy pushes a stool at her, knocking 
    her off balance. She falls to the floor, dropping the sword. Anya's lying 
    with her back on the floor. Buffy takes the sword, straddles Anya, and prepares 
    for another thorough double-fisted stabbing of Anya. Xander pushes Buffy out 
    of the way. They all stand up.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Stop trying to save me, Xander!</p>
<p><i>Lightening bolts flash in the room knocking everyone down, then D'Hoffryn 
    appears. </i></p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  Oh, please, don't mind me. Continue with whatever it was you were doing. (walks 
  to look in an adjacent room) Oh, breathtaking. It's like somebody slaughtered 
  an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog. (Buffy stands and grabs her sword) Easy now. 
  I'd be gone before you could swing. (sighs, offers a hand to Anya to help her 
  stand) Isn't that just like a slayer. Solving all her problems by sticking things 
  with sharp objects. I talked to your friend, Miss Rosenberg. She's a firebrand. 
  I have high hopes for her.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Stay away from Willow.</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  (to Anya) Oh, he's gallant, isn't he. I understand what you saw in him. (to 
  all) Look, Miss Rosenberg seems to think Anyanka would be better suited outside 
  the vengeance fold. I think we already know what Lady HacksAway wants. And the 
  young man, he sees with the eyeballs of love. But I'm not sure if anyone's bothered 
  to find out what Anyanka herself really wants. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Her name is Anya.</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  Actually, funny historical side-bar, her original name was—</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (crying) I wanna take it back. </p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  I'm sorry. What was that?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I wanna take it back. I wanna undo what I did.</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  Hmm. You want to take it back. Must be twelve bodies in there. Such a thing—not 
  easily done. But not impossible. You're a big girl, Anyanka. You understand 
  how this works. The proverbial scales must balance. In order to restore the 
  lives of the victims, the fates require a sacrifice. The life and soul of a 
  vengeance demon. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Do it.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Wait!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Stay out of this Xander. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  OK, all right. That seems smart. He just said you have to die! Perhaps there's 
  some sort of alternate price.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Xander, you can't help me. I'm not even sure there's a me to help. (to D'Hoffryn) 
  I understand the price. Do it.</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  You're sure? This is your wish?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  This is my wish. Undo what I did.</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  Very well. </p>
<p><i>D'Hoffryn gestures with his hands, and a flash of light appears. </i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  No!</p>
<p><i>Where the flash was, Halfrek shows up, smiling sweetly.</i></p>
<p><b>HALFREK</b><br/>
  Anya!</p>
<p><i>Anya looks at D'Hoffryn, realizing what's going to happen.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Hallie!</p>
<p><i>Halfrek bursts into flames and light shoots out of her eyes. She shrieks 
    and disappears. Anya starts to cry as D'Hoffryn berates her. </i></p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  Who did you think you were dealing with? Did you think it would be that easy 
  to get away?</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Why?</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  Why? Because you wished it!</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  But she was yours.</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  Like you were mine? Haven't I taught you anything, Anya? Never go for the kill 
  when you can go for the pain. (Xander starts for D'Hoffryn, but Buffy stops 
  him) Hold him back, Slayer. Wouldn't want anyone to get hurt. I've got plenty 
  of girls. There will always be vengeance demons. But now you, Anya, you're out. 
  Congratulations. You're wish is granted.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  You should've killed me.</p>
<p><b>D'HOFFRYN</b><br/>
  Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. From beneath you, it devours. Be patient. All 
  good things in time.</p>
<p><i>In a flash, D'Hoffryn disappears. Anya looks at Xander and Buffy and walks 
    out.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (to Xander) Go. I'll check on the boys.</p>

    AT U.C. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT<br/>
    Xander follows Anya outside the fraternity house. </b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Anya, wait.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Xander, please. Just go away. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Whatever's between us—it doesn't matter. You shouldn't be alone in this.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Yes, I should. My whole life, I've just clung to whatever came along. </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Well, speaking as a clingee— I kinda didn't mind. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Thanks. For everything. </p>
<p><i>Xander nods, realizing that this is her rejecting his offer to help.</i></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Xander— what if I'm really nobody?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Don't be a dope.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  I'm a dope?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Sometimes. </p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  That's a start. </p>
<p><i>Xander walks away, leaving a teary-eyed Anya to deal alone.</i></p>
