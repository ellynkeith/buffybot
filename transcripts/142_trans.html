<h3><b>PROLOGUE:</b></h3>
<p><b>9     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    The SITs, Giles, and the Scooby gang—minus Buffy, Spike, and Andrew—are 
    sitting together in the living room having a very disorganized discussion. 
    Everyone is talking over everyone else.</b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

    Power to the people? You sound like a child of the seventies.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    What we're saying is we're in charge in charge of ourselves.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    OK, you guys, let's just try not to freak out.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

    All I'm saying is now that Buffy's not here, we finally have some say in how 
    and when we lose our necks.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Maybe you don't have to be so blunt about (gestures a cutting motion with 
    his hand in front of his neck) the losing of the necks bit.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    (emphatically) No, let the girl speak the truth. We're all on death's door 
    repeatedly ringing the doorbell like maniacal girl scouts trying to make quota.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

    (shifts in his seat) You know, I'm thinking that everyone here shouldn't have 
    a say.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    We just have to find some way of having constructive dialogue without going 
    completely mad.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    Do you know the parliamentary procedure? 'Cause that's a convenient way of 
    organizing—</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

    I just wonder if those of us who have been here longer should have more of 
    a say.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Maybe we should break down into small groups so it wouldn't be so chaotic. 
    Faith, what do you think?</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    When I was involved with the Model UN, we found the parliamentary procedure 
    to be a total lifesaver. For example, once when I was Uruguay—anyway, 
    one of those "U" countries—it was like here, only we had this 
    system which allowed us to organize our conversation.</p>
<p><i>While Amanda is talking, Giles whispers to Dawn.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (to Dawn) She's going to be fine. Really, it's for the best.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (to Giles) Yeah? Then why do I feel like this?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>

    (to the group) I hear what you're saying, but—</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Shouldn't we get down to business?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (rolls her eyes) You guys, I think we're wasting time arguing about how to 
    argue.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>

    Well, why don't we—?</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    (to Amanda) Please do not mention parliamentary procedure.</p>
<p><b>CARIDAD</b><br/>
    (under her breath) I second that. </p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>

    Everyone, listen to me. Chill. All right? It's been a long night, and I don't 
    know about you, but I'm wiped. Maybe we should catch some sleep and figure 
    all this out in the morning.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Do we really have time to waste?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Look, I understand you guys are wicked stressed. Frankly, our situation blows. 
    We've got to stay cool. That's the only way we're going to get through this. 
    Can everyone handle that?</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>

    Yeah...yeah...we'll get some rest and then tomorrow, things won't seem so—</p>
<p><i>The lights go out in the house, and everyone jumps and gasps, frightened, 
    asking what happened.</i></p>
<p><b>CARIDAD</b><br/>
    The lights went out?</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
    I'll get some candles... if we have candles.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    I'll check the fuse box.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (looking out the window) Don't bother. All the lights on the whole street 
    just went out.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Which means?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (looking at the group) That the people from the power company have got the 
    hell out of Sunnydale.</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    I think I'm freaking out.</p>

    STREET - NIGHT<br/>

    The neighborhood is abandoned except for the last family putting their necessities 
    in the minivan. Buffy walks down the street by herself, with her arms crossed. 
    She sees a house and walks up to it.</b></p>

    HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy walks into the house and looks around. A man comes up to her from within 
    the house and points a shotgun in her face.</b></p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>

    Don't move. Get out of my house.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Hey. (takes the shotgun away from the man, sighs) I thought the place would 
    be empty. I was looking for a place to crash. You know, you really should 
    leave.</p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>
    (indignant)You can't just kick me out of my own house.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    (shrugs) Why not? It's what all the cool kids are doing nowadays. (walks into 
    the kitchen) This is not your house. It's not your town. Not anymore. (opens 
    the refrigerator) Got any Tab?</p>

<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>12     INT.     MISSION 
    - DAY<br/>

    Andrew and Spike are waiting inside the candlelit interior room of the mission. 
    Andrew is lying on the floor on his belly, leaning up on his elbows, propping 
    his head up on his hand, and swinging his feet together like a little boy. 
    Spike is sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall with his knees bent 
    up, and his arms resting on his knees.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (rhythmically) I spy with my little eye something that begins with a "T."</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (rolls his eyes) Tapestry.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>

    (smiles) Hey, good one. How did you—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Tapestry's the only thing in the whole bloody room.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Ah...so say you, but I say look deeper. (rolls over onto his back, looks at 
    the ceiling)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

    I'll look deep into your jugular is what I'll look at.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Don't spazz out. </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I'm not— (glares at Andrew) Don't say another word.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (rolls back on his belly, looks at Spike excitedly) Rock, paper, scissors? 
  </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    What's the matter with you? Don't you understand what's happening?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Uh...yeah. We're waiting here till it's night again so you can ride on your 
    motorcycle without exploding. </p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    And every minute we're stuck here, the slayer's out there facing hell knows 
    what.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Come on. What's the worst thing that could happen to her?</p>
<p><i>Spike glares at Andrew.</i></p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>13     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    The potentials and scoobies and Dawn, Giles and Faith are down in the basement 
    having another meeting by candlelight. Anya, Xander and Dawn are sitting at 
    a table. The others are gathered around. </b></p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    All right. So, what do we know?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

    Well, we know we're basically the last humans left in Sunnydale.</p>
<p><b>CARIDAD</b><br/>
    And that all the evil in town wants us dead.</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br/>
    I don't want to die.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>

    Don't worry. It's far more likely you'll live long enough to watch most of 
    your friends die first. (looks at Vi) And then you'll die.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    We also know that Caleb told Buffy that everything's going down at the seal. 
    I think we should head—</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (cuts her off) Let's not get ahead of ourselves. So, we know we've got a lot 
    of enemies. We'll start there.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

    Faith, I'm sorry—</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (cuts her off again) I got this, OK? So let's go over our rogues' gallery. 
    Who exactly do we have here?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Well, there's the First, who we can't touch.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

    Then there's our friend the reverend I-hate-women.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
    Who's basically untouchable.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    There's the 'roid-rage vamps, who are pretty much the worst. And the—</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>

    Bringers...I think they're our weakest link.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Are you thinking of attacking the Bringers?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Maybe, or... OK, we could kidnap one.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

    (nastily) And what? Hold it ransom?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (sarcastically) Yeah, I'll get the magazines and start ripping out the letters 
    now. "Dear Mr. First, if you want your Bringer back... well, we'll be 
    surprised because you got, like, 3 million of them. So please disregard this 
    letter. Yours sincerely—"</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    I'm saying we think about getting us a Bringer and making it talk. Find out 
    info on the first and Caleb that way.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>

    How do you think we should catch one if they don't want to be found?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    OK, I'm not sure this is such a good idea. Why try and get information when 
    we already know about the seal? Why don't we send a team to the high school? 
    Do some recon and—</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    No.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

    (sits back, raises eyebrows) Just like that? You're not even listening.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (softly, to Kennedy) Sweetie, you're pushing too hard.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    I thought things would be different now, but you keep shutting me down.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>

    Things are different, because now... (stands) I'm your boss. Look, you guys, 
    I'm not Buffy. I'm not the one who's been on your asses all this time, but 
    I'm not one of you anymore, either. I'm your leader, which means I go first, 
    and I make the rules, and the rest of you follow after me. Is that clear? 
    So, Kennedy, (points) back the hell off, and let me do my job, all right? 
    (calmly) OK, let's get down to business.</p>

    the vineyard. Buffy/First and Caleb look on.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>

    I was hoping you'd bring me some better news.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    And I wish I had some.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    Is this going to do anything? Or is all of this just to make the Bringers 
    sweat? Do the Bringers sweat?</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>

    Actually, I think they pant, like dogs. And I don't know if this is going 
    to do any good, but we have to try everything.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    You realize what will happen if the slayer and her girls get it, don't you?</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    They won't.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>

    (looks at Caleb) That's right. They won't. (walks away) Because you're going 
    to kill all of them and everyone they know.</p>

    comes up behind her wielding a knife, but someone lassos him around the neck 
    and pulls him to the ground. It's Giles. Giles ties up the Bringer as the 
    other potential slayers go to Kennedy's aid, fighting off the other Bringers 
    that have shown up, using the Bringers' knives against them.</b></p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (stands after killing a Bringer, panting) I've never been the bait before. 
    That was, uh... actually, kind of scary.</p>

<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>

    Oh, gross.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Hey...I've been reading this old Turkish spell book. There's an old conjuration 
    that the ancient Turks used to communicate with the dying.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Oh, yeah. I think I've read a translation of it.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>

    (wide-eyed) There's a translation of it?! (sighs) I'm over it. Um, so the 
    spell is used to communicate with people who can't talk. Um, like if a person 
    was dying, this spell would let them say their good-byes or, you know, gripe 
    about how nobody came to visit them. Would this help us with Mr. No-Tongue?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Yeah, I think so. I just need to get together a few ingredients.</p>

<p><i>Spike walks into the room.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Spike.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Hey.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (walks into the room, puts his helmet on a shelf) Hi, everybody. I missed 
    you guys a lot. Sorry it took so long to get back from our mission-mission, 
    but we had to wait out the sun. Well, I think our mission went very well. 
    We, uh, we rode on Spike's hog, which was very cool, and, uh... uh, played 
    some amusing games, and—oh! We got some new information. You know what? 
    I really need to urinate. (walks out of the room)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    He's a breath of fresh air, isn't he? Thank god I don't breathe. So, I think 
    we got a lead. Where's Buffy?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Um... (looks away) she's not here right now.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    When's she get back?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (walks toward Spike, wringing her hands, nervously) Uh...while you were gone, 
    we all got together and t-talked out some disagreements that we were having. 
    Um... and eventually, after much discussion, Buffy decided that it would be 
    best for all of us if she took a little time off, a little breather.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (stares in disbelief) Uh-huh. I see. Been practicing that little speech long, 
    have you? (Willow looks hurt and walks away) So, uh, Buffy took some time 
    off right in the middle of the apocalypse, and it was her decision?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Well, we all decided.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Oh, yeah. You all decided. (chuckles) You sad, sad, ungrateful traitors. Who 
    do you think you are?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    We're her friends. We just want—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Oh, that's ballsy of you. You're her friends, and you betray her like this?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    You don't understand—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    You know, I think I do... (disdainfully) Rupert. You used to be the big man, 
    didn't you? The teacher all full of wisdom. Now she's surpassed you, and you 
    can't handle it. She has saved your lives again and again. (the others roll 
    their eyes and avoid eye contact with Spike) She's died for you. And this 
    is how you thank—</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Hey. Why don't you take it down a notch or two? The time for speech-giving 
    is over, bat boy.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (crosses his arms) Oh, is that right?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Yeah, that's right. Save your lack of breath.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (shrugs) All right. (punches Faith) </p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    You're pretty sweet on her, aren't you? (kicks Spike in the face) I think 
    it's cute. (Spike punches Faith; she punches him back) They way she's got 
    you whipped. (kicks Spike into the other room where he slides over the dining 
    room table and onto the floor)</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Enough!</p>
<p><i>Faith goes into the dining room after Spike and starts punching him in 
    the face repeatedly. He kicks her off of him and leaps to his feet. </i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Finally got what you wanted, didn't you? (exchanges punches with Faith) Where 
    is she?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    I don't know.</p>
<p><i>Spike rolls Faith over his back and flings her into the dining room wall 
    pretty hard. She gets to her feet as does Spike, and they stare at each other 
    for a moment before Spike finally walks out the front door. All the others 
    are standing in the doorway watching the fight.</i></p>

    Spike walks out the front door and down the path toward the street. He pauses, 
    shuts his eyes, and smells purposefully. Finally he catches the scent he's 
    looking for and walks down the street. </b></p>

    A Bringer is chained to the basement wall as Willow does a spell in another 
    language. Giles, Kennedy, Xander, and Andrew are there as well. </b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (holding a book open in her hands) Speak to us.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    Maybe I should rough him up a little.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

    (to Andrew) Andrew!</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (to Andrew) Quiet!</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    I don't know, guys. That should have worked. (Giles and Willow stare at the 
    Bringer)</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>

    (not sounding like himself, but soft and monotonous) I am a drone in the mind 
    that is evil.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (to Andrew) Could you just shut up?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (not sounding like himself, but soft and monotonous) I say I'm part of the 
    great darkness.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

    (rolls her eyes) Somebody needs a reality check.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Or a muzzle.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (looks at Andrew) Wait.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>

    (speaking for the Bringer) I'm only a fragment of the we. We work as one to 
    serve the First.</p>
<p><i>Xander and Kennedy stand and back away from the table where Andrew is 
    sitting. Giles and Willow stand as well, and they all stare at Andrew.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    OK, what do you—the we—do for the First?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>

    (speaking for the Bringer) We work to prepare for the inevitable battle.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    (grabs the Bringer's knife off the table and holds it to the Bringer's throat) 
    How? Tell me exactly what the Bringers are doing.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Kennedy, he can't see the knife. </p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>

    (speaking for the Bringer) We can feel the knife.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Kennedy? (holds his hand out to her; she stands and hands him the knife)</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (speaking for the Bringer) We attend to the needs of the infinite evil. We 
    exterminate girls and destroy the legacy of the slayer. We build an arsenal 
    beneath the dirt. We obey the commands of our teacher Caleb.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

    Wait. Could we go back to the dirt thing?</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (speaking for the Bringer) We build weapons to prepare for the coming war... 
    at the farthest edge of town. We are everywhere. We are like the ocean's waves. 
    We watch your efforts and are not scared. We will laugh at you as you die.</p>
<p><i>Giles takes the Bringer's knife and slits the Bringer's throat with it. 
    The Bringer goes limp.</i></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (himself again, stands, upset) What the bananas?! You are so lucky that you 
    did not just... magically decapitate me.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    We've got enough here. We need to get Faith in on this. Xander, gather some 
    maps. We need to find a subterranean space large enough to house an armory.</p>
<p><i>Everyone else leaves the room and goes upstairs. </i></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (following after everyone) I feel used and violated, and... (holds his throat) 
    I need a lozenge.</p>

    later, Spike walks up to the room where she's sleeping.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (standing in the doorway) There you are. Do you realize I could just walk 
    in here, no invite needed? This town really is theirs now, isn't it? (walks 
    up to Buffy) I heard. I was over there. That bitch. (sighs) She's all about 
    smiles and reformation when you're on your feet, but the moment you're down, 
    she's all about the kicking, isn't that right? Makes me want—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    (softly, staring off into the corner) It wasn't just Faith. It was all of 
    them. (looks at Spike) And it's not like they were wrong. Please leave.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    No. (excited) This'll change your tune. I came here 'cause I got something 
    to tell you. You were right. Caleb is trying to protect something from you. 
    And I think you were spot on all the way. I think it's at the vineyard. So? 
    You were right. (she still hasn't moved or reacted) Buffy?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I don't feel very right.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Well, you're not a quitter.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    Watch me.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    You were their leader, and you still are. This isn't something you gave up, 
    it's something they took.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    Sewer tunnel on the north side's closest, so guess we'll start there.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Sounds fine. What time shall I tell everyone? </p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    How about around 7:00? (beat) 7:00 sharp. So, tomorrow we fight.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>

<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Yeah?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    You're doing just fine. (walks away) </p>
<p><i>Faith starts to walk toward the bed but looks up to see the Mayor (from 
    Season 3) standing there in front of her.</i></p>

<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Get out.</p>
<p><b>MAYOR/FIRST</b><br/>
    (laughs) Well, gosh. (smiles) I think, you know, a "hello" or a 
    "nice to see you" might be a little more welcome. It's the end of 
    humanity, Faith, (shakes his head) not the end of courtesy.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    You're wasting your time. I know who you are, what you are.</p>
<p><b>MAYOR/FIRST</b><br/>
    (nods) Yeah. Yeah. (looks at Faith) Nobody's explained to you how this works, 
    have they? (paces) You see... I am part of the First, as you kids call it, 
    but I'm also me, Richard Wilkins III, late mayor and founder of Sunnydale. 
    Here. I'll prove it to you. Ask me a question only I know the answer to. Something 
    like... (laughs) Where did I hide the moon pies in my office? Or... who was 
    my favorite character in little women? Meg. (laughs) I know. I know. Most 
    people guess Beth, but Meg, she's such a proper young lady. Remember when 
    Jo burned her hair?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (looks in his face) I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. 
    (walks away) But feel free to keep talking, 'cause, hell, I could listen to 
    you yap all night.</p>
<p><b>MAYOR/FIRST</b><br/>
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Language! You're a leader now. You keep throwing 
    the "h-e-double hockey sticks" around, pretty soon, the girls are 
    going to pick up on it. Then what?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (nods) You let me worry about the girls.</p>
<p><b>MAYOR/FIRST</b><br/>

    Of course. Of course. You're doing a great job with them, by the way. Much 
    better than Buffy ever did. You were smart to kick her out. </p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (shakes her head) That's not what we— (the Mayor looks at her, raises 
    his eyebrows in disbelief) Buffy got them this far.</p>
<p><b>MAYOR/FIRST</b><br/>
    Why are you protecting her? You think she cares about you? She nearly killed 
    you, Faith.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    It's different now.</p>
<p><b>MAYOR/FIRST</b><br/>
    (walks up to Faith) No matter what you do, Buffy will always see you as a 
    killer, not as a person. And now you have what she so desperately wants: the 
    respect of these girls. All she needs is an excuse, and she'll finish what 
    she started when she stuck that knife in your belly. You stay on guard, Faith. 
    Buffy's dangerous. If you're not careful, she'll destroy you. (shrugs) I'm 
    just saying.</p>

    No.</p>

<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

    You can get them back.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Can, maybe. Should? (sighs, holds her head in her hands) I'm just so tired.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    They need you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    Well, I...</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    It's bloody chaos over there without you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It is?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

    Yeah! Yeah, it's, uh... There's junk... You know? Food cartons, sleeping bags 
    not rolled up, everyone's very scared and, uh, unkempt.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (smirks) Sounds dire.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I didn't see a lot. (sits on the edge of the bed beside her) I came, hit Faith 
    a bunch of times, and left.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    Really? I mean, not that I'm glad, but—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Oh, you say the word, and she's a footnote in history. I'll make it look like 
    a painful accident.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    That's my problem. I say the word, some girl dies...every time.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

    There's always casualties in war.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Casualties. It just sounds so...casual. These are girls that I got killed. 
    I cut myself off from them...all of them. I knew I was gonna lose some of 
    them and I didn't— (shakes her head, stands up) You know what? I'm still 
    making excuses. I've always cut myself off. I've always— (sighs) Being 
    the slayer made me different. But it's my fault I stayed that way. People 
    are always trying to connect to me, and I just slip away. (chuckles) You should 
    know.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I seem to recall a certain amount of connecting.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (shakes her head) Oh, please! We were never close. You just wanted me because 
    I was...unattainable.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (stands, angrily) You think that's all that was?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Please, let's not go over the past. (sits)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Oh, no, no. Let's hold on here. I'm hummed along to your pity-ditty, and I 
    think I should have the mic for a bit.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Fine. The stage is yours. Cheer me up.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    You're insufferable.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Thank you. That really helped.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I'm not trying to cheer you up.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    What are you trying to say?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I don't know. I'll know when I'm done saying it. Something pissed me off, 
    and I just— "Unattainable." That's it.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Fine. I'm attainable. I'm an attain-a-thon. May I please just go to sleep?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>

    You listen to me. (kneels in front of her) I've been alive a bit longer than 
    you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, 
    and done things I prefer you didn't. I don't exactly have a reputation for 
    being a thinker. I follow my blood, which doesn't exactly rush in the direction 
    of my brain. So I make a lot of mistakes, a lot of wrong bloody calls. (looks 
    into her eyes) A 100+ years, and there's only one thing I've ever been sure 
    of: you. (Buffy looks away; he reaches toward her face) Hey, look at me. I'm 
    not asking you for anything. When I say, "I love you," it's not 
    because I want you or because I can't have you. It has nothing to do with 
    me. (a tear rolls down Buffy's cheek) I love what you are, what you do, how 
    you try. I've seen your kindness and your strength. I've seen the best and 
    the worst of you. And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. 
    You're a hell of a woman. You're the one, Buffy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (quietly) I don't wanna be the one.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    I don't wanna be this good looking and athletic. We all have crosses to bear. 
    (Buffy chuckles) You get some rest now. I'll check in before first light. 
    You can decide how you want... (walks toward the door)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Spike? (he turns to face her) Could you...stay here?</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Sure. (looks at a chair) That diabolical old torture device, the comfy chair. 
    (takes off his coat) It'll do me fine.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, I mean...here. (touches the bed beside her) Will you just hold me?</p>
<p><i>Spike sits on the bed beside Buffy and puts his arm around her. She curls

<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    You a shrink now?</p>
<p><b>MAYOR/FIRST</b><br/>
    (pacing) You keep looking for love and acceptance from these people, these

    ever love you. Not the way I love you.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>

    Get out.</p>

    They'll forever see you as a killer.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>

<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (startled) You shouldn't sneak up like that! I almost took your head off!</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>

    Sorry, I knocked.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Who—what'd you see?</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Just—you're looking spooked. What happened? Are you sure you're all right?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Oh, what? You wanna rap about my problems now? Are you looking to be the guy 
    who puts the "pal" in principal for me?</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    OK, you know what? I came up here to talk to you about weapons.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>

    (shakes head) Sorry. I don't know what I'm doing. (turns around) I'm just—</p>

    Listen, I'm gonna leave you alone. I didn't mean to intrude. (starts to walk 
    away)</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    It was the First.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>

    (walks back into the room; shuts the door) Well, you're really in the game 
    now, Faith. The First doesn't show itself unless it thinks you matter.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Lucky me. I'm a player. (holds out her hand) Man, look at that. My hand's 
    shaking. Demons, vampires, women in the penitentiary system—none of that 
    freaks me out.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    That's exactly what the First does—finds your Achilles' heel.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>

<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Um, it's a phrase. Your weak spot. </p>

<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    (walks up to Faith, sits on the edge of the bed beside her) So, who was it? 
    The First.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    He was like an old boss of mine.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Just a boss, and he's got you shaking like this? Wouldn't give you a raise, 
    huh?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (laughs) Yeah, right. Well, it sounds retarded, but he was like a dad to me.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Oh. It was my mother when it came to me. And I mean it was her, right down 
    to the perfume.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (looks at him) Sorry. </p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    (nods) Yeah.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    I'm just so pissed off at myself. I knew it was a trick.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Yeah, so did I, but I still wanted my mother to hold me like a little baby— 
    (blinks, sits up) in a manly way, of course.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Of course.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Listen, nobody wants to be alone, Faith. We all want someone who cares, to 
    be touched that way. (looks at her) I mean, the First deals in figments, but 
    that wanting is real.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Hitting things and a whole lot of Jack D dulls it some.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Among other things. (they both smile)</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (stands) When it came to you, did the First tell the truth? </p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Yeah.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    It said to watch out for Buffy, that Buffy's dangerous.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Well, what do you think?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (paces) Could be. I mean, we've given her pretty good reason to be pissed 
    off. You know the messed up thing? The First is telling me to worry about

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    OK, guys. Giles said Faith wants us to start early in the morning, so— 
    (looks around at her mostly empty room except for Kennedy on the bed) What 
    happened to the girls?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

    their snoring? (smiles) They're not here, are they?</p>

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

    Nice... (kissses Willow) and necessary. (puts her arm around Willow's waist) 
    Come here, you. (pushes Willow back on the bed so they're lying down beside 
    each other; they're still kissing) Foreplay was threatening to turn into twelve-play. 
    (Willow turns away) Something not right?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    No. No, I just, uh, guess I'm a little scared.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    It's probably stupid to ask why, huh? Death, war, apocalypse.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Me. I'm just scared that if we... and then I'll... and then...</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Good. Yeah, g-good feeling, but also...</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    Bad stuff, like unrestrained moaning and screaming with joy?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (turns to face Kennedy) Well, sort of. The unrestrained part. But I've just—I've 
    kind of been in this space where I should be restrained. I've been controlling 
    myself and I— if I lose that control, let myself go, I could just go.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>

    Hm. (strokes Willow's cheek) You worried you're gonna turn into big bad Willow?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    It's not stupid. When we first kissed, I turned into...Warren.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    It's not stupid, but it's not gonna happen. I just want you to know you're 
    safe with me.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>

<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    You can float around, and I'll tether you down. (smiles)</p>
