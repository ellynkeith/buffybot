<h3><b>PROLOGUE:</b></h3>
<p><b>23     EXT.     WOODS 
    - NIGHT<br/>
    A teenage girl is running through the woods at night, running for her life. 
    Bringers are chasing her. She sees an old pick-up truck driving down a dirt 
    road through the woods, and she runs in front of it, waving it down emphatically 
    with both arms. </b></p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
    Stop! Stop! Stop, please! (the driver slows and stops the truck; the girl 
    goes to the passenger door and speaks to him through the open window)</p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>
    (wearing a black shirt with priest's collar, speaking in a southern drawl) 
    What's goin' on?</p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
    Please get me out of here! (opens the passenger door and climbs in)</p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>
    Was someone hurt? What is it?</p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
    (shuts door) Drive.</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>24     INT.     TRUCK 
    - NIGHT<br/>
    The young girl is panting, catching her breath. She's sitting in the passenger's 
    seat in an old truck beside a man dressed as a preacher or priest.</b></p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>
    Well, that was, uh... Are you all right?</p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
    (panting) Thank you. Thank God you were there.</p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>
    Well, let's not give him credit for everything. (smiles) No, I'm funning you. 
    I don't believe it was a coincidence. I also don't believe young girls should 
    be out in the woods late at night—should be tucked in bed.</p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
    (softly) Wish I was.</p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>
    I expect you do at that. Look, I don't mean to pry, but those boys... they 
    looked like— Well, you didn't happen to fall in with devil worshipers, 
    did you? (the girl doesn't answer, just stares out the window) Na, I'm—I'm 
    sorry. You, uh, you look like you've been traveling a while. I didn't think 
    that— Is there some place you'd like me to drop you? You heading some 
    place?</p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
    Sunnydale.</p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>
    I'm going there myself. I ain't never been, but I expect we could find a police 
    station or a—</p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
    I just need to get to Revello Drive. (the man nods) Um, thanks, Father...</p>
<p><b>MAN / CALEB</b><br/>
    Call me Caleb. Never was nobody's daddy.</p>
<p><b>GIRL / SHANNON</b><br/>
    I'm Shannon.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Well, Shannon, you feel like telling me why those Freaky Joe's were after 
    you?</p>
<p><b>SHANNON</b><br/>
    I'm not sure.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Well, do you ever think that maybe they were chasing you because you're a 
    whore?</p>
<p><b>SHANNON</b><br/>
    (looks at Caleb, scoffs) What?</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Now, I know what you're thinking. Crazy preacher man spoutin' off at the mouth 
    about the whore of Babylon or some-such. That ain't me. I'm not here to lecture 
    you. I mean, what's the point? (presses in his dashboard cigarette lighter) 
    My words just curdle in your ears. Wouldn't take in a thing. (Shannon looks 
    around nervously, looks out the window) Head's filled with so much filth that 
    ain't no room for words of truth. Well, you know what you are, Shannon? Dirty.</p>
<p><b>SHANNON</b><br/>
    (offended) What? I'm not! What're—</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Now, now, now. There's no blame here. You were born dirty, born without a 
    soul. Born with that gaping maw wants to open up, suck out a man's marrow. 
    Makes me puke to think too hard on it. (Shannon touches the passenger side 
    door, trying to open it, but there's no handle) Yeah, that there door's problematical. 
    I don't know as I could recommend steppin' out at this speed anyway. You're 
    like as not to tumble some. But, of course, there's my boys back there—Ooh, 
    they hate to miss a mark.</p>
<p><b>SHANNON</b><br/>
    (shocked) Your boys?</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Well, they ain't exactly my "blue eyed boys" but they're hard workers. 
    And they don't truck with Satan—that was just me having fun. (looks at 
    Shannon) Satan is a little man. (Shannon reaches for the steering wheel, but 
    he pushes her away, pinning her against the seat, then shakes his finger at 
    her) I don't like back-seat drivers.</p>
<p><i>Caleb reaches to the dashboard and grabs the cigarette lighter. He places 
    the heated coil of the lighter on a ring he's wearing on the middle finger 
    of his right hand and presses it for a moment.</i></p>
<p><b>SHANNON</b><br/>
    (sees what Caleb's doing, and cowers) Please...don't hurt me.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Well, now, is this the part where you offer to do anything? Because I tried 
    to make it clear—you got nothin' I want to explore. </p>
<p><i>Caleb puts the lighter back in the dashboard and presses his heated ring 
    into Shannon's neck, making a sizzling sound. Shannon screams.</i></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Oh yeah. That's it! That's a cleansing fire. Hallelujah! Now, if I'm not mistaken, 
    there's a car a little ways behind us, and I do believe there's some folk 
    in it goin' the same place you are. Now, I want you to deliver a message for 
    me, but it's not for them. It's for the other one—the one and only, the 
    original, accept-no-substitutes slayer. Would you tell her something for me?</p>
<p><b>SHANNON</b><br/>
    (frightened) Yes.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Thank you, Shannon. (takes a knife and stabs Shannon in the stomach, then 
    whispers something in her ear) Now, let's see what we can't do about that 
    door. </p>
<p><i>Caleb kicks the door open and pushes Shannon out.</i></p>

    HIGHWAY - NIGHT<br/>
    Shannon falls out of the pick-up truck and rolls across the pavement. A car 
    driving toward her slams on its breaks. The driver, Willow, steps out and 
    runs to the girl's side. The passenger steps out of the car and saunters toward 
    Shannon.</b></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (to Shannon) Are you OK? Can you hear me? (rolls Shannon over) Can you talk? 
    (to her passenger) This girl's bleeding badly. We have to get her to the hospital.</p>
<p><i>As Willow's passenger walks forward into the light, show it's Faith standing 
    there.</i></p>

    he's under the blanket in his bed, and one of the potentials is sitting on 
    his bed in skimpy pajamas, chatting.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>

<p><b>POTENTIAL</b><br/>
    I haven't been able to sleep the last few nights.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Hey, listen. It's gonna be OK. Buffy knows what she's doing. She's not gonna 
    send you into battle until she's sure you're ready for action. (nods)</p>
<p><b>POTENTIAL</b><br/>
    That's just it, though. How will I know I'm ready...for action?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    You have to trust us.</p>

    I'm so scared, Xander. I'm so young. (looks into Xander's eyes)</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Well, believe it or not, I was younger than you when I started all this.</p>
<p><b>POTENTIAL</b><br/>
    There's just so much I haven't done, so much I need to do. It's like... I 
    never had a real boyfriend, you know?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Yeah?</p>
<p><b>POTENTIAL</b><br/>
    (coyly) I've never been with a man. I could die tomorrow, and I've never been 
    with a man.</p>

    Well, uh—</p>
<p><i>Another girl appears sitting on the bed beside the first potential. </i></p>
<p><b>POTENTIAL 2</b><br/>

<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    We can't.</p>
<p><b>COLLEEN</b><br/>
    We're so scared. (the first potential nods)</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    The others might hear us.</p>

    glaring at Xander with their arms crossed. </b></p>

    Yeah.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (looks at Willow) Something's killing girls all over the world, trying to 
    end the slayer line. Thing like that, figure I might get a heads up.</p>

    You were in prison. Figured you were safe there.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (scoffs) Yeah, that's prison. Safe as a kitten.</p>

    Sorry, I... don't know much about the big house. Was it— (Faith looks 
    away) I mean, did something happen in there?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (looks at Willow) Someone came at me with a nasty looking knife. Didn't really 
    know why 'til now.</p>

    Oh, Faith, we didn't—</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Forget it. It's cool. I get by. (gestures to the patient being operated on) 
    What're we gonna do about her?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Uh, I guess we should find Buffy, tell her what's going on. I-I tried calling 
    home. Dawn says she's out patrolling.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Let's go look for her. (walks away) Cemetery's more fun anyway. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Wait, somebody should wait here in case she wakes up.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (stops walking) Fine, sit tight. I'll be back. (walks away)</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    W-w-wait. Uh, maybe you meeting Buffy alone isn't the best idea.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (turns around) You told her the sitch, right? She knows I'm coming. Probably 
    been up all night hanging streamers. (grins sarcastically)</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    Yeah, but it's not like you're study buddies, exactly. Maybe it'd be better 
    if I...eased her into the whole thing.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    I can't stay here, Willow. Spent way too much time in hospitals. We don't 
    click. Don't worry. (grins) I'm sure we'll all get along just fine. (turns,

    her, knocking her down to the ground. Her pursuer kneels down to grab the

    Yeah. Terrific.</p>

<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    "Drink of this, for it is my blood." (drinks) You know, I always 
    loved the story of the Last Supper. (looks at his glass, turns, paces) The 
    body and blood of Christ becoming rich, red wine. I recall, as a boy, though, 
    I couldn't help but think: what would happen if you were at the Last Supper, 
    and you ordered the white? A nice oaky Chardonnay or White Zin... I mean, 
    would he make that out of his lymph or some-all? (shrugs) Never did bring 
    it up. Suppose there was a reason why I never spent too long in one parish. 
    Just looking for answers. Just looking for the Lord in the wrong damn places. 
    (gestures to someone in the room with him) Then you showed me the light.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST (O.S.)</b><br/>
    Do you think I'm God? (walks out from the shadows toward Caleb)</p>

    I certainly do not. I am beyond concepts like that.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    But you still wear the outfit.</p>

<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    How do you like what I'm wearing?</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Just another dirty girl. And, since you only dress up in dead folk, I'm guessing, 
    one who's already been paid her wage.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    Look hard. What do you see?</p>

    (checks out the First's form) Strength. And the loneliness that comes with

    goes through her head) All this time. All the work I've done for you... Blowing 
    up the Council, organizing the Ray Charles Brigade, and stickin' all them 
    splits—you never showed me.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    Well, you've earned it. And you'll be meeting her soon. Am I right?</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Oh, yeah. Yeah, she'll get the message.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    And what makes you so sure she'll come?</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    (points, nods) Curiosity. Woman's first sin. I offer her an apple. What can 
    she do but take it? (grins, gestures "cheers" with his glass) I'll

<p><b>HELPLESS GIRL</b><br/>

<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>

<p><b>HELPLESS GIRL</b><br/>
    I heard you speakin' tonight. Preachin'. I felt your words go straight to

<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Well, the truth is like a sword, isn't it, girl? Cuts deep.</p>
<p><b>HELPLESS GIRL</b><br/>
    (smiles) Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    The words I use got a power to them. (paces) A power, now. They're not just 
    words—they're truth.</p>
<p><b>HELPLESS GIRL</b><br/>
    (leans back against a wine barrel) They brought me here.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    They called you. You know why? Because you're human. (walks around her) You 
    got your urges. A woman's got hers. A man's got his. Our whole race can be 
    do damnably weak... (walks back toward the shadow) That's why we seek the 
    strength, the power. </p>
<p><b>HELPLESS GIRL</b><br/>
    It's not wrong to be drawn to the power, is it, preacher? (follows him into 
    the shadow)</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    Oh, no, child. It's not wrong... (the girl gasps and falls to the ground, 
    revealing a bloody stomach wound) Just human.</p>

    I take requests. (crosses arms) One of those potentials you killed, perhaps?</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    No, save them for later. I'm in more of an old memory lane kind of mood. Back 
    before I met you, there was this choir girl in Knoxville I used to give singing 
    lessons to...why, she even screamed on key. Show me her.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY/FIRST</b><br/>
    (shakes her head) All these girls...they followed you willingly. You tricked

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    Could happen. Something other-worldly. And here's a handy rule: don't go for 
    the flashy tentacles just because they're waving 'em about trying to get attention.

    protect the people around her. This girl has died two times, and she's still 
    standing. You're scared? That's smart. You got questions? You should. But 
    you doubt her motives, you think Buffy's all about the kill, then you take 
    the little bus to battle. (Buffy tears up) I've seen her heart, and this time—not 
    literally. And I'm telling you, right now, she cares more about your lives 
    than you will ever know. You gotta trust her. She's earned it.</p>

    tries to get up, but Caleb head-butts him, then throws him across the room 
    into a huge wine storage tank that busts when Spike hits it. Wine pours out 
    of the tank and washes Spike across the floor. Kennedy and the other potentials

    Caleb chuckles and bends to pick up a knife from the floor. He tosses the

    body. An arrow pierces the Bringer's forearm as he rears back. They turn to 
    look, and see Xander standing there with a bow. Faith's there beside him. 
    The Bringer leaves Rona and fights with Xander.</i></p>

<p><i>Xander runs to Buffy, fighting off Bringers on his way to her side. Holding 
    a knife in each hand, Faith engages Caleb in a fight, but she's not seeming 
    to faze him.</i></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    (looks Faith up and down) Well, you're the other one, aren't you. Your Cain 
    to her Abel. (Faith throws a knife at Caleb) No offense meant to Cain, of 
    course.</p>
<p><i>Faith attacks Caleb with her other knife, but he grabs her arm, twists 
    it, and crosses it with her other arm in a fashion such that she can't move, 
    but is looking right at him. He squeezes her hands until she's forced to drop 
    the knife. Faith grunts at him and knees him in the crotch, causing Caleb 
    to let go of her just enough that she can escape his grasp. She backhands 
    him across the face.</i></p>

    Oh, it has its moments. Paul had some good stuff, for instance. But overall 
    I find it a tad complicated (slaps Faith). I like to keep things simple. (kicks 
    Faith across the room into a stack of wine barrels) Good folk, bad folk, (a potential with long black hair swings at Caleb, but he grabs her
sword, then her face) clean folk, dirty

<p><i>Xander leaves. Caleb walks menacingly toward Molly, who backs up slowly, 
    frozen with fear. She raises her arm back to stab him, but he grabs her wrist, 
    then her neck. Another potential fights a Bringer. A Bringer throws Amanda 
    against a wall and attacks her. Buffy stands just as Caleb squeezes Molly's 
    neck, lifting her off the floor. Buffy tries to go to her, but Bringers keep 
    attacking her, slowing her down.</i></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    (to Molly) What can I say? I work in mysterious ways. (stabs Molly, lets go 
    of her neck, dropping her to the ground) Also some fairly straightforward 
    ones.</p>
<p><i>Enraged at seeing what he did to Molly, Buffy rushes Caleb. She fights 
    him more evenly this time, avoiding his punches, and landing a few of her 
    own. She punches him so hard, Caleb is sent flying across the room.</i></p>

    You're the one who sees everything, aren't you? (rears his hand back in front 
    of Xander's face) Well, let's see what we can't do about that.</p>
<p><i>Caleb plunges his thumb into Xander's left eye, gouging it out. Xander 
    screams in agony. Spike charges Caleb, knocking Xander away from Caleb. Xander, 
    bleeding from his eye, stumbles back, falling to the ground in front of wine 
    barrels.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (goes to Xander's side) Xander! Come on.</p>

<p><b>CALEB (V.O.)</b><br/>
    There once was a woman, and she was foul, like all women, for Adam's rib was

    up, they'll get in line. </p>
