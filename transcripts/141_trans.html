    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:</p>
<p><b>1     EXT.     WOODS - 
    NIGHT<br/>
    A teenage girl is running through the woods at night, running for her life. 
    Bringers are chasing her. She sees an old pick-up truck driving down a dirt 
    road through the woods, and she runs in front of it, waving it down emphatically 
    with both arms. The driver slows and stops the truck; the girl goes to the 
    passenger door and speaks to him through the open window.</b></p>
<p><b>MAN</b><br/>
  (wearing a black shirt with priest's collar, speaking in a southern drawl) What's 
  goin' on?</p>
<p><b>GIRL</b><br/>
  Please get me out of here! (opens the passenger door and climbs in)</p>
<p><b>Cut to:</b></p>
<p><b>2     INT.     TRUCK 
    - NIGHT<br/>
    The young girl is panting, catching her breath. She's sitting in the passenger's 
    seat in an old truck beside a man dressed as a preacher or priest.</b></p>
<p><b>MAN / CALEB</b><br/>
  Call me Caleb. Never was nobody's daddy.</p>
<p><b>GIRL / SHANNON</b><br/>
  I'm Shannon.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
  Now, I want you to deliver a message for me. It's for the one and only, the 
  original slayer. </p>
<p><i>Caleb takes a knife and stabs Shannon in the stomach. Caleb kicks the door 
    open and pushes Shannon out.</i></p>

    Buffy, Faith, and Spike walk into Buffy's house through the front door. Dawn 
    and Giles are at the dining room table.</b></p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  Hey, got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  (stands, nods) Hello, Faith.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  Well, I guess "wanted" wasn't really accurate.</p>

<p><b>4     INT.     WORKSHOP 
    AT ROBIN'S PLACE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy walks up to Robin, who's trying to stand. She looks around the room, 
    then walks up to Robin again.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I have a mission to save the world. I don't have time for vendettas. (walks 
  away) The mission is what matters.</p>

<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Save the sermon, padre. I heard you have something of mine.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
  (chuckles) I do now. (with one powerful punch, he sends Buffy flying across 
  the room) </p>
<p><i>A dark-haired potential swings at Caleb, but he grabs her sword, then her 
    face, then Caleb snaps her neck and drops her to the ground.</i></p>

  (weakly trying to sit up) Get them out of here. </p>
<p><i>Xander leaves. Caleb walks menacingly toward Molly, who backs up slowly, 
    frozen with fear. She raises her arm back to stab him, but he grabs her wrist, 
    then her neck. Caleb squeezes Molly's neck, lifting her off the floor. </i></p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
  (to Molly) I work in mysterious ways. (stabs Molly, lets go of her neck, dropping 
  her to the ground) </p>

    his thumb into Xander's left eye, gouging it out. Xander screams in agony.

<h3><b>PROLOGUE:</b></h3>
<p><b>7     EXT.     STREET 
    - DAY<br/>
    A man closes his shop. There's lots of traffic and honking on the street. 
    The street is full of cars, all pointed in the same direction, but no one's 
    moving. People are even walking through the street carrying belongings. Buffy 
    walks among them, looking around, when someone in a car calls out to her. 
    It's Clem, driving a late model red VW Beetle.</b></p>
<p><b>CLEM</b><br/>
  Hey, you.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Hey.</p>
<p><b>CLEM</b><br/>
  Can you believe this mishegaas?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Yeah. You'd think these people had never seen an apocalypse before. (chuckles) 
  What about you? Just going for a quick spin to 7-Eleven... in Nebraska?</p>
<p><b>CLEM</b><br/>
  It's getting bad here. Really bad. Hellmouth acting up again, people feeling 
  it, getting crazier. You can't swing a cat without hitting some kind of demonic 
  activity. Not that I swing cats, or eat—nope. Heh. Cuttin' way back. Cholesterol—morals. 
  I mean, morals.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Right.</p>
<p><b>CLEM</b><br/>
  We've seen some bad stuff in this town before but, you know, this time, it's 
  like it just seems different, more powerful. (shakes his head) I don't think 
  anyone's gonna be able to stop it. (catches himself) I mean, I'm sure you'll 
  do fine. Complete confidence in you. Heh. Uh, if anyone can do it, you can, 
  because you...rock! If you save the world, I'll come back, we'll have drinks. 
  When. When, I mean. When you save the world. (Buffy nods) It's gonna be great 
  with all the... rocking. (sincerely) Maybe... maybe you should just get out 
  of town this time.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Yeah. I probably should.</p>
<p><b>CLEM</b><br/>
  You take care of yourself, OK? (waves, then softly) Bye. (drives off)</p>

<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>8     EXT.     POLICE 
    STATION - DAY<br/>
    Willow and Giles are talking to an officer outside the police station. The 
    streets there are chaotic too, with the honking and the traffic. Giles is 
    wearing a gray turtle-neck sweater and a black trench coat. Willow's staring 
    intently at the officer.</b></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Ah, thank you, officer. We—we appreciate your help.</p>
<p><b>OFFICER</b><br/>
  Oh, no, thank you, Inspector. We don't get a lot of contact with Interpol, so 
  we're happy to help you with anything you need. Is there anything else we can 
  help with?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  No. Thank you. We're fine.</p>
<p><b>OFFICER</b><br/>
  Right... because— Wait... Who are—who are you?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (started intently at the officer) I'm with the Inspector.</p>
<p><b>OFFICER</b><br/>
  You're with the Inspector. Right. Well, we don't get a lot of contact with Interpol, 
  so—</p>
<p><i>While Willow and Giles are talking to the officer, two other officers 
    escort a crazy man into the police station.</i></p>
<p><b>CRAZY CITIZEN</b><br/>
  (rambling to himself) A single step! </p>
<p><b>OFFICER 3</b><br/>
  (to pedestrians) Stay on the sidewalk, folks.</p>
<p><b>CRAZY CITIZEN</b><br/>
    A single step, and it is upon us. It is nigh! From beneath you it—</p>
<p><b>OFFICER 2</b><br/>
  Freakin' nutcase.</p>
<p><i>The two officers take the crazy man inside the police station.</i></p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (looking over at the man) Ow.</p>
<p><b>OFFICER</b><br/>
  Uh, people are acting up, getting nuts. Man, you just let us know if you need 
  help with your guy 'cause we are itching to hand out some justice. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (looking back toward the man) He—he doesn't seem like much of a threat.</p>
<p><b>OFFICER</b><br/>
  (squinting at Willow) And—and you are?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Um, I think it's time we were catching our flight to, um... Interpol. (pulls 
  Willow away)</p>
<p><b>OFFICER</b><br/>
  Right. OK.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (walking away with Giles) Good idea. My control was fading. What's up with those 
  cops?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Oh, same as everyone. The hellmouth is active again. </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Come on. I want to get back to Xander. (they leave)</p>
<p><i>The two officers come out of the building and chat with the one Willow and 
    Giles were talking to.</i></p>
<p><b>OFFICER 2</b><br/>
  (looking off after Willow and Giles) Who was that?</p>
<p><b>OFFICER</b><br/>
  (shrugs) Um, I— I don't know.</p>
<p><b>OFFICER 3</b><br/>
  (holds out a flyer) Did you get one of these yet?</p>
<p><b>OFFICER</b><br/>
  No. What is that?</p>
<p><b>OFFICER 2</b><br/>
  Fugitive. Ran to ground right here in our own backyard. </p>
<p><b>OFFICER</b><br/>
  (eagerly) Yeah? Sounds like a situation that needs some justice.</p>

<p><b>9     INT.     HOSPITAL 
    - DAY<br/>
    Buffy and Willow are talking to Xander in his hospital room. Xander's left 
    eye is covered with a bandage. Willow is sitting on the edge of his bed, holding 
    his hand. Buffy's standing, talking to him.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  And that you should expect to see some bruising when you remove the bandages. 
  Bruising around the— area. The, uh, bone structure and musculature was hit 
  pretty hard.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  OK.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Um, also they said that the—the meds may cause you some stomach discomfort, 
  so we're gonna have to be careful with your diet.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I can't taste anything right now anyway. I keep waiting for my other senses 
  to improve 50%. Yeah, they should kick in any day now.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (smiling) Well, we're looking at a possible release as early as tonight. Um, 
  we're just waiting for your labs to get back, and Dr. Kallet said that should 
  be a couple of hours.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  That's great.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (nods) OK. Um, I think we're all caught up then. (holding the files, to Willow) 
  Thank you for this. This was, um, really great work.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (disappointed) Oh. I thought we were gonna... (looks at Xander, then at Buffy) 
    There were gonna be card games.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Oh, no, I just— I should really get back. (Willow looks heartbroken) I want 
  to get everyone started on this. I think we're really close to something.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  It's OK. It's gotta be done. And I might see you tonight, without depth perception, 
  of course, but... still. (smiles) </p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (holding Xander's hand) So, I guess you're stuck with me then, huh? (tries to 
  sound chipper) Let's order some cherry-flavored off-brand gelatin, and then 
  I think we'll be up for a rousing game of—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I might need a parrot.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Huh?</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Well, to go with the eye patch, to really complete the look. I think I still 
  have that costume from Halloween.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Yeah, and don't underestimate the impact of a peg leg. Maybe the hospital can 
  hook you up with a nice one. Maybe they have a 2-body-parts for the price of 
  one kind of deal.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  Oh, you know what the best part is? No one will ever make me watch jaws 3-D 
  again.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Yeah, and, (tries to smile) you'll never have to... (tries to stifle her tears 
  as they well up in her eyes, squeezes Xander's hand tighter)</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (sighs, looks at Willow as tears well up in her eyes) Oh, Willow... please don't.</p>
<p><i>Willow looks down, trying to keep her tears from falling. She's desperately 
    trying not to make a scene here, for Xander's sake.</i></p>

<p><b>10     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Anya is standing in front of the group of potentials lecturing while Andrew 
    stands to her side, writing key words on an easel-pad. Andrew writes "UBERVAMP."</b></p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  And so we know that a battle is coming. Ubervamps galore. We also know that 
  the Ubervamps are hard to kill...</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  (writing in red) Hard...to...kill.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  But I have been out talking to some of my old contacts, and they've provided 
  some surprising bits of news. Yay for them! (Andrew draws a picture of an Ubervamp) 
  Uh...OK. For example, Ubervamps can be staked... right through the heart. Zing—poof. 
  (Andrew writes "steak" then crosses it out and writes "stake" 
  beside it) Just like regular vamps. Um...we didn't know this. (Andrew draws 
  a red arrow from the word "stake" to the torso of his Ubervamp drawing) 
  Of course, these guys have incredibly strong sternums, so it's a lot like driving 
  a wooden stake through solid steel. But you guys are all super-strong, right?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  (scoffs) Um...no.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  Right. OK. Um... but still, heart information, still good to know since holy 
  water seems to run off these guys like they've been scotch-guarded. And, well, 
  sunlight would work, but guess what— they're not coming out during the daytime. 
  (Andrew flips to a clean sheet of paper and draws a yellow smiling sun) Uh, 
  also, beware of their, uh, teeth and the claws they use to shred flesh. (Anya 
  holds up her hand, fingers spread, like she's clawing and shredding with her 
  hand; Andrew writes "teeth, claws")</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
  OK, you know what? I used to be really afraid of these Ubervamp guys. But then 
  the scary preacher blew into town, and now I'm mostly terrified of him.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (flips her note cards) Right, well, um... we're working on getting info on that 
  guy.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
  Why bother? Nothing works. Nothing will.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (shuffling her note cards) OK... I know you're all upset... and I, myself, would 
  much rather be sitting at the bedside of my one-eyed ex-fiance than killing 
  time here with you people in this over-crowded and might I add increasingly 
  ripe-smelling basement. And I would be, too, if not for a certain awkward discussion 
  he and I recently had right over there on that cot immediately following some 
  exciting and unexpected breakup sex. (some of the girls seem grossed out and 
  move off the cot; Andrew writes "breakup sex" on the paper, underlining 
  it) But...I need to give him some space... so I'm doing what I can do, contributing 
  any way I can... and so will all of you. You still need to know this information. 
  We can't stop just because something else is trying to kill you, too.</p>

    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY<br/>
    Faith's sitting alone on the countertop in Buffy's kitchen eating potato chips 
    from a bag when Kennedy walks upstairs.</b></p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  You got enough to share?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  Trade ya for a carton of cigarettes and some soap. (Kennedy looks confused) 
  Sorry. Habit. (Faith hands Kennedy the bag) Shouldn't you be down at Hogwarts?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  (takes some chips) Probably. (hands the bag back to Faith) </p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  All right. Playin' hooky. Score one for the boarding school brat. Anya's technique's 
  probably a little different than what you're used to.</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
  (walks upstairs from the basement into the kitchen) Do you think there are gonna 
  be questions about her sex life on the test? 'Cause I really hope I don't have 
  to study all that.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  Yeah. (grins) Whenever she starts talking about getting all sweaty with Xander 
  like that I just remind her I had him first. Shuts her right the hell up.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  Thing is— what's the point? Studying demon hot zones and pressure points doesn't 
  do a hell of a lot of good when preacher man's out there, ready to finish the 
  job he started.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  No one's come up with any info on Caleb yet?</p>
<p><b>AMANDA</b><br/>
  No. Nothing is working—not research, not Anya's contacts.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  We're lousy with dead ends around here. (crosses her arms) Everyone's feeling 
  pretty pointless. We don't even have a place to start.</p>

<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Hey, Buffy, how's Xander?</p>
<p><i>Faith, Kennedy, and Amanda go into the dining room.</i></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  He's doing really well. He's ready to come home, I think. (smiles, puts down 
  the file on the table, starts opening it)</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  Whatcha got?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Info that Giles and Willow were able to pull off the police database. We figured 
  with Caleb's, you know, overt religiosity thing if we wanna learn more about 
  him, let's find out where he's been.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  (reading from the file) "Incidents of violence and vandalism connected 
  to California religious institutions in the last 10 years." Looks like 
  this gives us a place to start.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Yeah. I figure we start with California. We don't find anything there, we'll 
  expand the search. But a guy like Caleb didn't just get in the game. He's been 
  playing for a while, and I wanna know where. Whatever it takes. (to Dawn) You 
  good to help?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Well, I was gonna do lots and lots of homework, but darn the luck, they went 
  and canceled school, (Buffy hands Dawn papers) so looks like I got the time.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Good.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (sits) Hey, Buffy... How was Xander's mood, you know, exactly? (Buffy doesn't 
    look at her) And did you get a chance to talk to the doctor about the meds? 
    Because it seemed like—</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  Hey, pipsqueak, why don't you go get some of the stuff you've already gotten 
  from Giles?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Or, um, we can talk about this later, maybe.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (still hasn't looked at Dawn) OK.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Yeah. I'll be right back. (leaves the room)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Try to find anything that looks like Caleb, his church, his ring... </p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
    His ability to render a slayer useless in just one punch. (Buffy looks up, 
    hurt; Faith frowns) I didn't— that was stupid. I don't know why I said 
    that.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (stifling tears, stands) Uh, it's OK. Um...you know, I—I have to go to the 
  school to pick up the rest of my stuff.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  (stands) I really didn't mean—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  It's fine. Really, it's fine. Don't worry about it. Hey, uh... isn't Anya doing 
  that thing for you guys today?</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  Yeah. We were. We probably should head down there now.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (smiles) OK. I'll be back soon. (Kennedy and Amanda leave; to Faith) See that

    HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Resume. Caleb has just confronted Buffy in her old office.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Get out of here.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
  Now, now, little girl. Manners. I do imagine that firebrand tongue of yours 
  has inflamed many a man, weak as they are. (looks around) This here's a, uh... 
  public school, ain't it? Kinda deserted. Only just, I suppose. Folks work so 
  hard at keepin' the Lord out, and look what happens in return. (Buffy backs 
  up to a filing cabinet) He abandons you. (Buffy reaches for a drawer in the 
  cabinet) Not that He could do you much good now, anyway— (Caleb turns to see 
  Buffy trying to reach into the cabinet for something) Ah, ah, ah. (condescending) 
  Wouldn't do that were I you, swee'pea. Fightin' back didn't do you much good 
  last time, did it? And how is poor, sweet Xander? Let him know he's in my prayers, 
  and any time he's willin', I'm ready to... (makes a poking gesture) finish the 
  job.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Go near Xander again, and I will end you.</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
  (pushes over Buffy's desk violently, walks purposefully toward Buffy) Mind your 
  manners. I do believe I did warn you once. You're angry... frustrated, scared. 
  I like that in a girl. You really should relax a little. Look at where you are. 
  History's gonna look back at you, at me, at this place, and they're gonna see 
  the glory. Great things are happenin' now, right here. This school, the seal... 
  it's all gonna be a part of the great sweepin' tide of change, and you're gonna 
  be a part of it. Now, why would you wanna miss that? More importantly, why would 
  you want to get in its way?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (scowls) I guess I'm just ornery. (punches Caleb in the face)</p>
<p><b>CALEB</b><br/>
    (laughs) Ha ha ha! Oh, I knew you'd be a wild one— </p>
<p><i>Buffy kicks him, but he grabs her leg and pushes her down. She kicks his 
    shins, but he picks her up off the ground by her neck.</i></p>
<p> <b>CALEB</b><br/>
    I'm gonna take such sweet pleasure in taming you. (throws Buffy through the 
    window; she lands across the hall, unconscious) I'll see you soon, little 
    lady. (walks away)</p>

  OK, well, here's the one that stood out. It's, um, a mission up north in Gilroy. 
  (hands Giles some files)</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  (walks up to the counter) Um, Mr. Giles, Faith stole the last meatball-and-mozzarella-flavored 
  hot pocket out of the freezer even though I had called dibs on it.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  (looking at a picture, ignoring Andrew) I don't see anything.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Exactly. No vandalism at all. </p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Then why is it in the file?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  The place was abandoned. (Andrew walks to the freezer in a huff) Um... locals 
  started noticing after a few days that no one was going in or out. 6 members 
  of the order lived there, but when the cops showed up... all gone. Unsolved.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  (grabs a box from the freezer) Yup. See, the post-it's still here: "Andrew's. 
  Please do not eat." But the box is empty now. (shakes the box)</p>

  See, it's not the hot pocket itself— even though it did have that new-and-improved 
  thicker tomato sauce— it's just the fundamental lack of respect.</p>

    (to Andrew) Shut up. Pay attention. (holds the magnifying glass over the photo) 
    Dawn, what do you see?</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  What am I looking for?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  On the back wall, A... knothole.</p>

  Spike, I have a mission for you.</p>

  Oh, really? 'Cause, you know, sometimes our missions end up with you trying 
  to kill me. I'm not fond of those.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  This is bona fide... with real ramifications. Take a look at this. (hands Spike 
  the photo and the magnifying glass)</p>

  Well, you are always saying you wanna get out of the house more.</p>

  Yeah, but—</p>

  There may be demons... lurking about. You never know. He's a demon expert. He 
  can help.</p>

    did those police files work out? Were they helpful?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Uh...uh... yes. (sits) Very much so, I think. Um... there's evidence that Caleb

    didn't know you very well might think you were out lookin' for a fight or 
    something. (mock-punches him) Maybe you got bigger issues than what's wrong 
    with B. I read people, too. (a car pulls into the driveway) Xander's home.

    - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike pushes open the creaky front door to the mission as Andrew stands nervously 
    behind him. Spike sighs and walks in, followed by Andrew.</b></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  No one's here. These kinda places make me feel funny inside.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  I'll buy that. You and me got something else in common after all.</p>
<p><i>Someone jumps out of a closet as they walk past, grabbing Andrew and pushing 
    him against the wall.</i></p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Spike!</p>
<p><i>Spike pulls the robed man off of Andrew, and the man punches Spike. They 
    start to fight. Spike pushes the man against the wall, and he falls to the 
    ground. Spike pushes the hood off of the man's face to reveal a burn mark 
    on the man's cheek. The mark looks like something Caleb made with his ring.</i></p>

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    There's a hastily made yellow banner painted with "WELCOME HOME" 
    in big red letters hanging over the fireplace. Giles, Dawn and the potentials 
    are gathered in the living room as Buffy and Willow escort Xander in the room. 
    Faith and Robin Wood follow, closing the door behind them. </b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  (looking around) Oh, God.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  We didn't have time to do more. You have to pretend there's a big party here.</p>
<p><i>Dawn goes up to Xander and gives him a big, long, tight hug. </i></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  That's fine. Parties in this house, I usually end up having to... rebuild something.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Welcome home, Xander. I wanted you to be here for this. I think you'll be interested 
  in what I found out.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  W-what did you find out?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I-it's about the cellar. Look, I know that night wasn't fun for any of us... 
  but I figured out some things about that place, and I realize now what we have 
  to do. (Giles looks at her, concerned) We're going back in.</p>

<h3>ACT IV:</h3>
<p><b>33     INT.     MISSION 
    - NIGHT<br/>
    Spike and Andrew recognize the shape of the robed man's scar and stare at 
    him. Spike bends down to get a better look. </b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Tell me about the mark.</p>
<p><b>MONK</b><br/>
  Oh... (covers the scar with his hand)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Hey! Are you part of Caleb's faction?</p>
<p><b>MONK</b><br/>
  (shakes his head) No! No!</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Then tell me what happened.</p>
<p><b>MONK</b><br/>
  (weakly, frightened) I c-can't.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (bends down to get in his face) "Can't" is a 4-letter word! I'm 
    Andrew. I'll be your bad cop this evening. You don't start singing, my associate 
    here—</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  We're trying to fight him. Caleb. We need your help. (Andrew stands) </p>
<p><b>MONK</b><br/>
  You can't fight him. You can't stop him. You can only run.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
    (bends down to get in his face) "Run" is a 4-letter wor— (catches 
    himself ) A 3-letter word. (stands)</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (stands) Talk.</p>
<p><b>MONK</b><br/>
  I'll do better. I'll show you. (Spike offers the man his hand, helping him to 
  his feet) One night, (grabs a candelabra) some time ago, a man arrived at our 
  doors.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  And you said, "come in, do some damage"?</p>
<p><b>MONK</b><br/>
  We are—we are a benevolent order, and, yes, we welcomed him. We offered to 
  feed him... but he had come for something else. </p>
<p><i>The monk walks up to a statue of Mary in an alcove, just as seen on the 
    picture that led Spike here in the first place. He touches a secret lever, 
    causing the statue to swing out of the way, revealing a secret compartment 
    behind it.</i></p>
<p><b>MONK</b><br/>
  Behind this, he revealed something even we didn't know was here. A secret room. 
  (walks in; Spike and Andrew follow) He was excited, talking the whole time... 
  destiny, that sort of thing.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  Yeah. We hear he's a real smooth talker.</p>
<p><b>MONK</b><br/>
  (takes a tapestry off the wall, revealing an inscription behind it) He was going 
  on about this ancient inscription.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Neat.</p>
<p><b>MONK</b><br/>
  He read it... and he didn't like what it said. His temper... He was the purest 
  evil I've ever seen. He burned his mark upon me. And then I ran and I hid... 
  and I listened to the others die.</p>
<p><b>ANDREW</b><br/>
  Running away...saved your life. (Spike takes the candelabra from the monk and 
  walks up to the inscription) What does it say?</p>
<p><i>The inscription is Latin words written with Greek letters: <b>Non tibi 
    est. Ei solae tractare licet.</b></i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
  (translating) "It is not for thee. It is for her alone to wield."</p>

<p><b>34     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br/>
    Buffy addresses the meeting of Giles, Dawn, Faith, Willow, Xander, Robin Wood 
    and all the potentials in her living room. Xander is sitting in an overstuffed 
    chair, with Dawn sitting beside him on the arm of the chair. Kennedy is sitting 
    on the sofa, with Willow sitting beside her on the arm of the sofa. Anya is 
    standing beside Willow with her arms crossed.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Look, I know what you're thinking, but I had a visit at the school today from 
  Caleb.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  Buffy, why didn't you—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I'm fine. I mean, it wasn't fun, but I'm fine. I'm better than fine. I—I figured 
  something out. He kept making all this noise about the school.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN WOOD</b><br/>
  Is it that seal again?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  Do we need to try shutting it again?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No, that's just it. We've spent all this time worrying about the seal and the 
  hellmouth. Why isn't Caleb guarding them? Why doesn't he have someone there 
  protecting it? Why is he camped out at the vineyard? The bad guys always go 
  where the power is. So if the seal was so important to Caleb and the First, 
  they would be there right now. They're protecting the vineyard or something 
  at the vineyard. I say it's their power, and I say it's time we go in and take 
  it away from them.</p>
<p><i>Xander shakes his head and looks down. Giles uncrosses his arms and sighs. 
    </i> </p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    (standing beside Robin Wood with her arms crossed) Or, in the alternative, 
    how 'bout...we don't? I mean, it's a neat theory, B, but I'm not going back 
    in that place, not without proof, and neither should you and neither should 
    they.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN WOOD</b><br/>
  I think Faith had the floor.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  Maybe it ends OK the way you wanna play it, but maybe it doesn't. And right 
  now, I don't think I want you playin' the odds.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Did you come here to fight?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  Listen, we're fighters, all of us, but you gotta give me something to fight, 
  something real, not—</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  (softly) Windmills. (looks at Buffy) </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  There is something there.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Maybe. But we can't be sure of that. This is a hell of a lot to ask.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN WOOD</b><br/>
  Too much.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (grinning nervously, looks around) I—I don't understand this. For 7 years, 
  I've kept us safe by doing this— exactly this, making the hard decisions. And 
  now, what— suddenly you're all acting like you can't trust me?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  Didn't you say to me today you can't trust us? Maybe there's something there 
  that should be addressed.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Is that why you sent Spike away, to ambush me?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  (rolls his eyes, sighs) Oh, come on. </p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
  You know what? I am sick of your deal with this Spike guy. This isn't about 
  him. This is about you. You're being reckless.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (steps back) What?</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
  You are! I don't even know you, and I can tell! You are so obsessed with beating 
  Caleb, you are willing to jump into any plan without thinking.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (through gritted teeth) That's not what I'm doing.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  (stands, walks up to Buffy) Well, that's how it feels to us. People are dying.</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (stands, walks up to Kennedy) Kennedy...</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  (turns and snaps at Willow) Why are you always standing up for her?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  (softly, sadly) I'm not.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  What do you mean, you're not?</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
  With everything that's happened, I— (shrugs) I'm worried about your judgment.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (looks around) Look, I wish this could be a democracy. I really do. Democracies 
  don't win battles. (Xander looks away) It's a hard truth, but there has to be 
  a single voice. You need someone to issue orders and be reckless sometimes and 
  not take your feelings into account. You need someone to lead you.</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  (calmly) And it's automatically you. (looks at Buffy) You really do think you're 
  better than we are.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No, I—</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  But we don't know. We don't know if you're actually better. I mean, you came 
  into the world with certain advantages, sure. I mean, that's the legacy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I—</p>
<p><b>ANYA</b><br/>
  But you didn't earn it. You didn't work for it. You've never had anybody come 
  up to you and say you deserve these things more than anyone else. They were 
  just handed to you. So that doesn't make you better than us. It makes you luckier 
  than us.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  I've gotten us this far.</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  But not without a price.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Xander—</p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
  I'm trying to see your point here, Buff... but I guess it must be a little bit 
  to my left... (shakes his head) 'cause I just don't.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Look, I'm willing to talk strategy, OK, I'll hear suggestions on how to break 
  this down, but this is the plan. We have to be together on this or we will fail 
  again.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
  We are clearly demonstrating that we are not together on this!</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (commandingly) Which is why you have to fall in line! I'm still in charge here. 
</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
  Why is that, exactly?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Because I'm the slayer.</p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
  And isn't Faith a slayer, too?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  (caught off guard) What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. So not what I meant. I'm not in charge 
  chick. I think B here needs to just...chill out for a little bit, take a siesta 
  or something. But I'm not the one you want.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  Maybe we need a vote... to see who wants Faith to have a turn in charge.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (sternly) No.</p>
<p><b>KENNEDY</b><br/>
  No, what?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  No. You don't get to vote until I've had my chance to pal around, you know, 
  get everybody drunk. See, I didn't get this was a popularity contest. I should 
  have equal time to bake them cookies, braid their hair—</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
    Learn their names?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (laughs) You're just lovin' this, aren't you?</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  You have no idea what I'm feeling.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (low, mean) Come in here, take everything that I have... You did it before. 
    Did you tell them that? Did you tell them how you used to kill people for 
    fun? Hey, you guys think that's nifty?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Buffy, that's enough!</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  I didn't come here to take anything away from you, but I'm not gonna be your 
  little lapdog, either. I came here to beat the other guy, to do right, however 
  it works. I don't know if I can lead. But the real question is...can you follow?</p>
<p><b>ROBIN WOOD</b><br/>
  So we vote.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Wait. Guys— </p>
<p><i>Buffy looks around—Anya's crossed her arms and stares back with pursed 
    lips; Willow looks away—Buffy searches their faces.</i></p>
<p> <b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    I can't watch you just throw away everything that— (looks at Xander and 
    at Dawn, who's not meeting her glance; Buffy holds her head up high) I know 
    I'm right about this. I just need a little— I can't stay here and watch 
    her lead you into some disaster.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    (stands, walks up to Buffy, softly) Then you can't stay here. Buffy, I love 
    you, but you were right. We have to be together on this. You can't be a part 
    of it. (Buffy blinks her eyes in disbelief) So I need you to leave. I'm sorry, 
    but this is my house, too.</p>
<p><i>Buffy looks around then walks out the front door.</i></p>
<p><b>RONA</b><br/>
    Ding dong, the witch is dead.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
  (low, angrily) Shut your mouth.</p>

  (concerned) Hey. Look, I swear I didn't want it to go this way—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  (sternly) Don't.</p>
<p><b>FAITH</b><br/>
  I mean it, I—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
  Don't...be afraid to lead them. (Buffy's face is wet with tears) Whether you 
  wanted it or not, their lives are yours. It's only gonna get harder. Protect
