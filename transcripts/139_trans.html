<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (looks at Buffy) There was a choice.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (looks at Giles) Right. Either repair the chip, or to remove it.</p>

    You removed the chip?</p>

    (turns to face Giles) Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from

    her help. Principal Wood overpowers one of the vampires and stakes him. Then

<h3><b>PROLOGUE:</b></h3>
<p><b>8     EXT.     PARK 
    IN NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT<br/>
    TITLE: New York City, 1977<br/>
    It's pouring down rain in the middle of the night somewhere in the city. Two 
    people are fighting in the paved walkway in a park. It's a pretty rough fight. 
    Zoom in on them to show vamped Spike fighting Nikki. Nikki kicks Spike, sending 
    him tumbling. He stands and speaks to her.</b></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (exhilarated) Well, all right. Got the moves, don't you? I'm gonna ride you 
    hard before I put you away, luv.</p>
<p><b>NIKKI</b><br/>
    You sure about that? You actually look a little wet and limp to me. And I 
    ain't your "luv."</p>
<p><i>Nikki kicks Spike and they begin fighting again. Zoom in on a nearby park 
    bench. A little boy watches them from behind the bench, peeking through the 
    slats. Spike and Nikki continue to fight. Spike overpowers Nikki, pushing 
    her to the ground and straddling her, punching her repeatedly in the face. 
    Nikki grabs Spike's arm and kicks him off of her. The little boy is still 
    watching them fight. Nikki punches Spike, but this time, he grabs her arm 
    and twists it around so that he can almost bite her neck. Alarmed, the boy 
    stands, knocking over the trash can beside him. This startles Spike, who turns 
    to see what happened. Nikki seizes the moment, and head-butts Spike, freeing 
    herself from his grip. She then elbows him, punches him, and knocks him down. 
    When he stands, she has a stake ready and throws it at his heart. Spike catches 
    it between his palms only inches in front of his chest. </i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    (grinning) I spent a long time trying to track you down. Don't want the dance 
    to end so soon, do you, Nikki? The music's just starting, isn't it? (tosses 
    the stake back toward her; it lands on the pavement; Spike starts to walk 
    away, but swings around on a lamp post, staring at her) By the way...love 
    the coat. (walks away)</p>
<p><b>YOUNG ROBIN</b><br/>
    (from behind the bench) Mamma!</p>
<p><b>NIKKI</b><br/>
    (goes up to Robin, squats down to be on eye-level with him) You did a good 
    job, baby boy. You stayed down just like mamma told you.</p>
<p><b>YOUNG ROBIN</b><br/>
    Can we go home now?</p>
<p><b>NIKKI</b><br/>
    Uh-uh. It's not safe there anymore. How 'bout I leave you over at Crowley's 
    house, and you can play with those spooky doodads that you like.</p>
<p><b>YOUNG ROBIN</b><br/>
    No, I wanna stay with you.</p>
<p><b>NIKKI</b><br/>
    (looks back over her shoulder, then back at Robin) Yeah, I know you do, baby. 
    But remember, Robin, honey what we talked about. Always got to work the mission. 
    (Robin looks down) Look at me. (Robin looks at Nikki) You know I love you, 
    but I got a job to do. The mission is what matters...right? (Robin nods) That's 
    my boy. Come on.</p>
<p><i>Nikki stands and takes Robin's hand. They walk away, but Robin turns around 
    and runs back to the scene of the fight to pick up the stake that Spike dropped.

    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT<br/>
    Adult Robin Wood turns to look over his shoulder, stake in hand. He's fighting 
    vampires, as are Buffy and Spike, who are there with him. Spike twirls a pole 
    and stakes his opponent through the heart. Buffy's fighting a vampire, but 
    calls out to Spike.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Spike! (nods her head toward Robin)</p>
<p><i>Spike looks over at Robin, who's fighting a vampire. The vampire is beating 
    up on Robin, but just as the vampire throws Robin to the ground and stands 
    over him growling, he turns to dust. As the dust settles, Spike can be seen 
    standing behind the vampire with a shovel in his hand. </i></p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Little tip, mate. (offers Robin a hand to help him stand) Stake's your friend. 
    Don't be afraid to use it. (starts to walk away, but notices Robin staring 
    at him) What?</p>
<p><i>Robin just shakes his head. Zoom in on a stake in Robin's closed fist—he's 
    squeezing it so tight that blood is oozing out between his fingers.</i></p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    (glaring at Spike, mumbling under his breath) Just waiting for my moment.</p>

<h3>ACT I:</h3>
<p><b>10     INT.     PRINCIPAL'S 
    OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY<br/>
    Robin is peeking out of his window through the Levelor blinds, watching the 
    students in the hallway. His hand is bandaged. Buffy walks up to his door.</b></p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Situation still normal. (shrugs) Well, or as normal as this school ever sees.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    (lets go of the blinds) So it appears. (turns)</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (puts her purse down) Well, no fires, no one's head's going kablooey. And 
    the swing choir and the marching band have gone back to their normal, healthy 
    seething resentment.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    (smiles) Yeah, it's been pretty quiet around here since you shut down that 
    seal. (walks up to Buffy) You just may have stopped this thing, Buffy.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, it can't be that easy.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    You call that easy?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Hey, any apocalypse I avert without dying? Yeah, those are the easy ones.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    (looks down) You know, you're, uh...You're something else, Miss Summers. (looks 
    at Buffy) You know, I've been watching you when you're out patrolling, and 
    you, um— You remind me of my, um...</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Your mother?</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Yeah. Yeah, what I remember of her, anyway.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Got to tell you, not a line every girl likes to hear, but—in this case— 
    (smiles) compliment taken. Maybe you're right. Maybe everything is fine.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (walks up to Buffy) Everything's terrible. Total catastrophe.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Giles, what's wrong?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Have you seen the new library? There's nothing but computers. There's not 
    a book to be seen. I—I don't know where to begin, Buffy. I mean, who 
    do we speak to?</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Uh, that would—that would be me. (offers his hand to Giles) Hi. I'm Robin 
    Wood.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Oh, sorry. (shakes Robin's hand) Rupert Giles. Sorry. Buffy tells me you're 
    something of a freelance demon fighter. (Robin points to his office door, 
    then closes it) Oh, yes, yes. I, um, I'm relieved. We're running dangerously 
    low on allies.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    So, we didn't stop it, then?</p>
<p><i>Robin sits behind his desk, Buffy sits on it.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (leans forward on Robin's desk) Uh, no, the seers at the coven are certain 
    the First is continuing to gather its forces. I'm afraid war is inevitable. 
    (stands) So, we should go before the school board. </p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    (confused) What?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Well, I can have my backup library (Buffy rolls her eyes) sent from home in 
    the mean time. It's not much, but—</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Giles.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Knowledge comes from crafted bindings and pages, Buffy, not ones and zeros.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    So, did you bring back any potentials?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Um, no. Actually, m-my, uh, (takes off glasses to clean them) my trip is about 
    something else...regarding Spike.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Spike? What about him?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    I told you my concerns when you recklessly chose (puts glasses on) to remove 
    the chip from his head. </p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Wait, sorry, chip?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Uh, it's a long story. </p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    The military put a chip in Spike's head so he couldn't hurt anyone.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    And that would be the abridged version.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    But he wouldn't hurt anyone anymore because he has a soul now.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Unless the First triggers him again.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Triggers the chip?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, the trigger's a post-hypnotic thing. The First put it in his head. It 
    was—made him— He was killing again.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    So, he has a trigger, a soul, and a chip?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Not anymore.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    (angrily) It was killing him, Giles.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    The trigger?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    No, the chip. The trigger's not active anymore.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    Because the military gave him a soul? (Buffy and Giles glare at Robin, who 
    throws up his hands) Sorry.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    We don't know that the trigger is inactive. (walks over to the window) What 
    I brought back may help us to disarm it, to ascertain exactly what it is that 
    causes Spike's behavior.</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It was that song, Giles. I'm telling you, it was that song that Spike was 
    singing.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    He has no memory of it. Is there any part of it that you can remember?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    It wasn't like it had a catchy hook or anything like "I'm coming up, 
    so you better get this party started." It was boring, old, and English. 
    Just like you—ull. Yule Brenner. (Giles crosses his arms and glares at 
    Buffy) A British Yule Brenner.</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    (to Giles) This thing you brought to keep Spike from killing again... How's 
    it work?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Well, it will require a bit of magic.</p>

    Xander is fastening shackles around Spike's wrists.</b></p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (mumbling) No, we couldn't have put these chains back up a week ago. Nah, 
    we gotta work on Spike now, of all times.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    What? </p>
<p><b>XANDER</b><br/>
    (sighs, stands, looks around) Nothing. (walks away) </p>
<p><i>Pan around the room to show everyone's there: Dawn, Buffy, Giles, Robin, 
    Xander. They're all staring at Spike, who's chained to the wall, sitting on 
    his cot.</i></p>

    (to Robin) What are you doing here? You came to see the show?</p>
<p><b>ROBIN</b><br/>
    I thought you might need support.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Uh-huh. Right, let's get this over with. (to Giles) What're you gonna do? 
    Some hypno-beam? A disarming spell?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    (walks up to Spike, but keeps his distance) Not exactly. The First has brainwashed 
    you. There's something in your subconscious that it's using to provoke a violent 
    reaction. So... (takes a small box out of his pocket, and takes a small rock 
    out of the box) we have to put this in your brain.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    Bugger that! </p>
<p><i>Buffy's eyes grow wide with concern when she sees the stone, but she remains 
    quiet, standing there with her arms crossed.</i></p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    The Prokaryote stone will move within your mind to reveal the root of the 
    trigger's power. Can unleash ideas, images, memories... Hopefully, once you 
    understand what it is that's...(rolls his eyes) setting you off, you can break 
    its hold on you.</p>
<p><b>DAWN</b><br/>
    Hopefully? So, it might not work?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    The stone's just a catalyst for the process. The rest is up to Spike.</p>
<p><b>SPIKE</b><br/>
    And how do expect to get that hunk of rubble into my cranium?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Willow? (puts the stone in the box and holds it out toward Willow)</p>
<p><b>WILLOW</b><br/>
    (walks in carrying a large book) OK. I just hope my pronunciation is in the 
    ballpark. (reading) "Kun'ati belek sup'sion. Bok'vata im kele'beshus.

    with lots of knick-knacks around, the walls are covered with paintings, and 
    there's a cozy fire in the fireplace. Zoom in on the man to show it's Spike

    Don't kill him yet.</p>

    What? Why not?</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Because I'm asking you not to. (Buffy rolls her eyes, then rolls off the vampire; 
    they begin fighting again) Would you let this vampire live if he began saving 
    the world?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>
    Sure. (punches the vampire in the face) Seems like a nice enough guy.</p>
<p><b>VAMPIRE</b><br/>
    Thanks.</p>

    No problem. </p>

    My name's Richard.</p>

    Hi, Rich. (punches the vampire again, knocking him down) Giles, we had this 
    conversation when I told you that I wouldn't sacrifice Dawn to stop Glory 
    from destroying the world.</p>
<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    Ah, yes, but things are different, aren't they? After what you've been through, 
    faced with the same choice now, (paces) you'd let her die.</p>

<p><b>GILES</b><br/>
    No. (Buffy and the vampire continue to fight) So, you really do understand 
    the difficult decisions you'll have to make? That anyone of us is expendable 
    in this war?</p>
<p><b>BUFFY</b><br/>

    we could be together forever. She said some nasty bits to me after I did that. 
    Been weighing on me for quite some time. (points at Robin) But you helped 
    me figure something out. You see, unlike you, I had a mother who loved me 
    back. When I sired her, I set loose a demon, and it tore into me, but it was 
    the demon talking, not her. (stands) I realize that now. (walks toward the

    (pacing) Spike's a liability, Buffy. He refuses to see it, and so do you. 
    Angel left here because he realized how harmful your relationship with him

    come out of this thing alive. (Robin sighs) You try anything again, he'll 
    kill you. (Robin laughs) More importantly, I'll let him. (Robin looks at Buffy)
