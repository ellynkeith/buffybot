Perhaps it's my advancing years that make me so forgetful, William. Remind me:
Why don't we kill you?
What's that?
I'm not your "mate." And when did you start talking like that?
...You've got me and my women hiding in the luxury of a mine shaft - all because William the Bloody likes attention. This is not a reputation we need.
All the more reason to use a certain amount of finesse.
And every time you do, we become the hunted.
That's brilliant strategy. Really, pure cunning.
No. A real kill, a good kill - it takes an artistry. Without that, we're just animals.
You can't keep this up forever. If I can't teach you, maybe someday an angry crowd will. That, or the Slayer.
(not pleased) Congratulations. I guess that makes you one of us.
This whole place reeks of it.
Let's get out of here. This rebellion's starting to bore me.
