Ow! Wait. Not ow. You feeling all right, Slayer? That stuff usually hurts...
What do you --
(wary, is this payback?) I did.
You know, there's quite a few American beers that are highly underrated.
This unfortunately is not one of them.
Right. You want to learn all about how I bested the Slayers, and you want to learn fast. All right then: We fought, I won, the end, pay up.
(interrupting) What did you want? Eh? A quick demo? Blow-for-blow description you can map out and memorize? Pfah. It's not about the moves, Love. And since I agreed to your little proposition, we're going to do this my way. Wings.
Spicy buffalo wings. Order me up a plate, I'm feeling peckish.
As I thought. Some nasty thing got a taste of you.
Right, stuck in a dark corner with the creature you loathe, digging up past uglies. 'Cause you're "fine."
I told you, no one's narrating on an empty stomach here...
What can I tell you, baby? I've always been bad.
"Lu-mi-nous..." no, no, uh, "irra-di-ant..." better...
Quickly, I'm the very spirit of vexation. What's another word for "illuminate?" It's perfectly perfect as many words go but the bother is nothing rhymes, you see.
(under his breath) Cecily.
I prefer not to think of such dark, ugly business at all. That's what police are for.
I prefer placing my energies into creating things of beauty.
Careful!
Ink's still wet. Please, it's not finished...
Cecily...
They're vulgarians. Can't you see? They're not like you and I.
They're about how I feel.
Every syllable.
I know... This is sudden. And - and, please, if they're no good, they're only words. But the feeling behind them... I love you, Cecily.
I know I'm a bad poet. But I'm a good man. All I ask is that you try to see me...
Bloody... watch where you're going!
Nothing. I wish to be alone.
What could you possibly know of me?
Th-that's quite close enough. I've heard tales of London pickpockets. You'll not get my purse, I tell you.
Yes... I mean, no. I mean - Mother's expecting me.
I - yes! God, yes!
Ow. Ow! OW! Ow ow ow ow OW-WOO!
Nine in the side.
Nah, please, don't make it sound like something you'd flip past on the Discovery Channel. Becoming a vampire is a profound and powerful experience. I could feel this new strength coursing through me. Getting killed made me fill really alive for the very first time. I was through living by society's rules. Decided to make a few of my own. 'Course, in order to do that...
(through smoke) I had to get myself a gang.
(choking) ...Ike...
It's "Spike" now. You'd do well to remember it, mate.
I'm sorry, did I sully our good name? We're <i>vampires</i>.
Bollocks! That stuff's for the frilly cuffs and collars crowd. I'll take a good brawl any day.
Yeah, know what I prefer to being hunted? Getting caught.
Sod off. When's the last time you unleashed it? All out fighting a mob, back to the wall, nothing but fists and fangs? Don't you ever get tired of fights you know you're gonna win?
Poofter.
<i>Now</i> you're getting it!
What's a Slayer?
After that, I was obsessed. I mean, to most vampires, the Slayer was this object of cold sweat and frightened whispers. But I never hid. Hell, I sought her out. I mean, if you're looking for fun, there's Death, there's Glory, and sod all else, right? (shrugs) I was young.
Funny you should ask.
Lesson the first: a Slayer must always reach for a weapon.
I've already got mine.
Good thing, too. Become a vampire, there's nothing to fear. Nothing but one girl. That's you, honey. Back then...
...It was her.
Just like I pictured. This good for you?
Sorry, Love. I don't speak Chinese.
(to himself) A fella could get used to this.
Suppose it is, yeah.
Only way, innit?
â€¦"Pet." Ever hear them say the blood of a Slayer is a powerful aphrodisiac?
'Course you do. Here now...
Have a taste.
No need to be humble.
Don't be so glum, mate. Way you tell it, one Slayer snuffs it, another one rises. I figure there's a new Chosen One, getting all chosen as we speak. Tell you what: if and when this new bird does show up - I give you first crack at her.
And I've had some sweet ones.
What are you looking at?
Well, <i>yeah</i>. Suppose you're telling me you don't? How many of my kind, reckon you've done?
And we just keep coming. Like a wave of roaches, and here you are doing a minute waltz, trying to stomp us all. But you can kill a hundred. A thousand. A thousand thousand and the armies of Hell besides. But all we need...
...Is for one of us, just one, sooner or later, to have the thing we all are hoping for.
(whisper) One. Good. Day
What? You asked and I'm telling. Problem with you, Summers is you've gotten so good, you're starting to think you're immortal.
Huh. Then how you explain <i>this</i>?
Aah!!
Not even close.
Lesson the second: ask the right questions. You want to know how I beat 'em.
The question isn't "how'd I win." The question is <u>why'd they lose</u>?
There's a big difference, luv.
Bit like this.
Knew I couldn't touch you. If there's no intent to hurt you, then the chip they shoved up my brain never activates. If, on the other hand...
AHH!!
(laughing) See, now that hurt.
Oh, so good.
Definite pain there.
You're not ready to know.
Okay then. Went like this:
The first one was all business. But the second - now she had a touch of your style.
Oh, yeah!
She was cunning, resourceful, and oh, did I mention? <i>Hot</i>. I could have danced all night with that one.
It's all we've ever done.
Every day you wake up it's the same bloody question what haunts you: Is today the day I die? It's a warrior's pain, a warrior's question and you ask it...
(continued) ...every time the sun rises. And every day you manage to survive, you're only partly relieved because you know - it's just a matter of time.
Death is on your heels baby - and, sooner or later, it's going to catch you...
(continued) And some part of you <u>wants</u> it. Not only to stop the fear and the uncertainty - but because you're just a little bit in love with it.
Death is your art. You make it with your hands, day after day. That final gasp, that look of peace...
Part of you is desperate to know... What's it like? Where does it lead you? That's also a warrior's question. A warrior's curiosity.
So you see, that's the secret. Not the punch she didn't throw or the kick she didn't land. She simply wanted it. Every Slayer has a death wish.
Even you.
The only reason you've lasted as long as you have is, you've got ties to the world. Your Mum. Brat kid sister. Scoobies. They tie you here but you're just putting off the inevitable. Sooner or later, you're gonna want it and the second, the <i><u>second</u></i>...
...that happens, I pray to God I'm there. I'll slip in - have myself a real good day.
Here endeth the lesson. I just wonder if you'll like it as much as she did-
Hey. You asked. Sorry if the answer isn't cuddly enough for you-
Ooooh, did I scare you? You're the Slayer. Do something about it. Hit me.
Come on. One good swing. You know you want to.
So do I. Give it to me good, Buffy. Do it.
(still holding her) Come on. I can feel it, Slayer. You know you want to dance.
(muttering) Beneath me, I'll show her, put her six bloody feet beneath me...
Hasn't got a death wish?
The bitch won't need one.
Got two barrels here that'll prove you wrong.
This is different. Move.
(losing patience) Harm...
Yeah, it'll hurt like hell for about two hours.
And she'll be dead just a little longer than that.
So, Sunnyhell was not our finest hour. And yes, I made a deal with the Slayer. But you were shagging Angel <i>and</i> bringing about an Apocalypse to end all life as we know it. So? Every couple's got their ups and downs, Love. Point being, we got through all that, it's behind us now. Isn't it?
Right. We'll pick up and move again, and we'll keep moving 'til we've found the perfect spot, and there I'll make you my queen.
Just tell me what you want.
You're the one who keeps bringing her up! I haven't said a word about the bloody Slayer since we left California! She's on the other side of the planet, Dru! Gone from our lives forever!
But I did, Pet. I did if for you! And you're still punishing me, you think I don't know what's going on with you?
This is my fault now?
Yeah, why don't you do that?
What's wrong?
Is there something I can do?
