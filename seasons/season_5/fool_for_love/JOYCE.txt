Hi, Riley.
Fine. Bordering on chipper. And tomorrow, I'm planning to be obnoxious.
Buffy, when you get a minute, I want to go over the grocery list for next week, and there's some things I need picked up at the gallery.
No rush.
Are you disinfecting something?
(to Dawn) But you keep pushing the envelope, honey. (to Buffy) See you in a few?
Oh. Great. Thanks, hon.
Fine. You seen my conditioner?
Okay. I'd love to put this off, but... (big breath) You know that "nothing" I've been dealing with, the past couple of weeks?
It might not be nothing.
I'm staying overnight at the hospital for observation. I'm getting a cat scan.
It's only one day. And they say if there is anything it's still very early if they didn't see it before. I'm gonna be fine.
