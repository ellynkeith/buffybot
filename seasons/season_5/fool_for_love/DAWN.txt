Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt the sex-capades. I just wanted to tell you...
...Mom's coming.
Mine.
Some nail polish experiments are doomed before they even begin.
Did I just pull off a Slayer- related Mom cover-up thing?
Come on. Who's the man?
Oh, cool. I mean, gross. I mean, both. Are you all red and squishy under there?
That's it? I cover your butt and then you dump your chores on me?
I got it, you're covered, we're good. (examines wound) Lucky it's not bikini season.
When do I get to patrol?
