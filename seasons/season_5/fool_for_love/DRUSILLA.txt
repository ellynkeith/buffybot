What possible catastrophe came crashing down from heaven and brought this dashing stranger...
...To tears?
You've been alone too long.
I've seen you. A man surrounded by fools who cannot see his strength. His vision. His glory. That, and burning baby fish swimming all 'round your head.
Don't need a purse. Your wealth lies here. (touching his heart) And here. (touches his head) In the spirit and imagination. You walk in worlds the others can't begin to imagine.
I see what you want. Something glowing, and glistening. Something effulgent. Do you want it?
The King of Cups expects a picnic, but this is not his birthday.
Ooh, Spike. Look at the wonderful mess you made.
Naughty, wicked Spike. That's a Slayer you've done in.
All by yourself?
That and the sound of a thousand little cherubs, crying their eyes out over all the spilled milk.
May I tell?
My Spikey's just killed a Slayer!
I smell fear --
It's intoxicating.
I hate it here. Furry little animals peering at us from out of the trees, and the people all taste funny.
I want the Slayer dead, Spike.
But you're lying, I can still see her. Floating all around you. Laughing. Why don't you push her away?
I have to find my pleasures, Spike. You taste like ashes.
You can't blame a girl, Spike, you're all covered with her. I look at you, all I see is the Slayer.
