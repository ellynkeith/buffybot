There's no wake?
(to Dawn) Mrs. Kaplan brought some enchiladas  over. Or there's chicken stuff. I saw  chicken stuff.
Tomorrow?
But maybe you and Buffy should… It's  sort of a question for your sister. It's  fine with me.
Dawn?
I'm stopping by my mom's first.  Been doing that a lot.
Guys - not here.
He didn't leave a card.
There you go. (pats the floor) Best mattress in the house. Good for the back.
Oh… Dawn. This just sucks,  doesn't it? I wish I could help more.  (off her silence) The only thing is, it'll get better.  I promise. It'll take time - but it  won't hurt so much after a while.
Not forget. No. You…
Dawn?
(anxious) Hey. We don't have to talk about it.  We can just go to sleep.
Great. What are you up for?
You want us to teach you something? A glamour or - or I can make a stuffed animal dance-
We do, but…
I'm not even sure it's possible, Dawn.  I mean, I've seen things about resurrection.  There are books and stuff…
But I guess… the spells backfire?
(quickly/to Dawn) That's not the point. The point is, it's bad. Because…
(a bit reluctant) She's right, Dawn. It's too dangerous.  We can't go there.
Dawn-
Hey. We're heading down for  breakfast…
That's okay. It's just, we have  class after that. I don't know if  you want to go home or…
Oh. Well…
Okay. Sure. Hang out. I have a  break around lunch time, I'll come back.
I'll try my luck. A noonish Dawn  break would make my day.
What did I have for breakfast  this morning? Do you remember?
I want to say bagel but I think  that was yesterday. You had  eggs, sunny side up. I remember  because they were wiggling at  me like little boobs…
My journal.
Yeah, I figured, you know…  Life goes by fast. If you don't  write it down, a lot of it just  gets… lost. And I want to  remember.
Down to every last everything  I do with you.
What?
I - it isn't there?
What? No, she didn't. She did?
But it's just a history book. It  might answer some of her  questions - but it's not like she  could do any harm with that  stuff. Could she?
I didn't- I mean, hey! How'd  she know that?
(too quickly) Nothing.
I think. I <u>think</u> she took nothing else  but maybe she did and we should look,  because who knows? I don't.
We need to call Buffy. Now.
