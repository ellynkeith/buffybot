(looking at casket) Yeah. I…
(nods &amp; points) That one.
You don't like it?
Dawn-
Dawn. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea, you coming along…
I'm serious. You shouldn't have  to deal with this stuff-
(quickly) No. It's fine. It's done. (to Dawn) Okay?
Okay…
Let's just go with them, then.  It's simpler.
White. They're nice. (to Giles) What about an announcement?  People are going to be expecting  a wake after the burial if we  don't say something.
Mom didn't like them. (smiles a little) She said pot lucks are depressing  enough as it is.
Right before she went in for her  operation. We had a talk about  what she wanted. In case…
You should eat, Dawn.
This isn't about-
I'm phoned out. Can you? I mean,  unless it's Dad.
I can't believe he hasn't called yet.
(nods) The number he left for us in Spain is  no good. And I've left messages all  over the place.
I don't have that number. I told you.
Dawn. I tried that. Okay? (to Willow and Xander) What do you think? Just a line that  says "following the burial, there will  be no wake-" or gathering? "there  will be no gathering at the request of  Joyce?" That's lame.
I guess. I don't know. How about "At  the request of the family, there will be  no wake following the burial?"
Where do I put it? On top, here?  Or on the bottom?
Humm?
If you want. I guess so…
(to Giles) Do we call the post office about  this? Maybe we need to fill out  a form or something.
Yeah. She should probably get out of here.
I'm okay. Thanks.
…the funeral was… It was brutal…  But what I'm really worried about  is tomorrow.
That's what I don't know. Up 'til  now I've had a road map - things  to do, every minute, that had to do  with mom…
(nods) Which everybody expects me to know  how to do because I'm so "strong."
Time's not the issue. I'm good at  sticking wood in vampires, but Mom  was the strong one in real life. She  always knew how to make things better,  what to say…
I don't know… (desperate) I keep thinking about it, Angel. When  I found her. If I'd gotten there ten  minutes earlier-
No. Probably wouldn't have made  a difference. The exact thing they  said was <u>probably</u>. I haven't told  anyone that-
(anguished) I didn't even start CPR until they  told me to. I fell apart. That's  how good I am at being a grown up.
If I just had me to worry about…  But Dawn…
It's going to be light soon.
How's forever? Is forever good for you? (then) There's a bad idea. I'm seriously  needy right now.
Told you. (reluctantly) You'd better go.
Don't be. I'm so grateful you came,  Angel. I didn't think I was going to  make it through the night.
Good.
Good…
Hello? Hey Tara. Yeah, I just got in-
<u>Dawn</u>-
What have you done?
<u>What have you done</u>?!
You have no idea what you're  messing with! Who knows what  you actually raised - what's  going to come through that door-
No. Tara told me these spells go  bad all the time. People come back <u>wrong</u>-
Who told you? Who helped you?!
You have to stop it, reverse it-
<u>Dawn</u>. You <u>know</u> this is wrong.  You know you can't let this happen.  Not to Mom.
(shocked) What? Of course you do. You have me-
That's - that's not true-
God - of course I care. Of course I do.  How can you think that?
I've been working - I've been busy,  because I have to… be…
I'm <u>not</u>. I have to do these things,  'cause… 'cause when I stop, then  she's really… gone. And I'm trying,  really trying to take care of things…  But I don't even know what I'm doing…  Mom, she always knew-
Well, who's going to be if I'm not?  Huh, Dawn? Have you thought  about that? Who's going to make  things better? Who's going to take  care of us?
I didn't mean to push you away…  I didn't… I just didn't want you to  see me… I mean… Oh, God…  What are we going to do, Dawny?  I'm so scared-
Mommy?
Mom!
Dawn-
