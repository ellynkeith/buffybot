Hey. Dawn is kind of ready to go…  Is it okay if we take her?
What about you? We can wait, if you want.
How about something for your tummy,  Dawn? Aren't you hungry at all?
Sure she does. We're witches. We know stuff.
You make a place in your heart for  her. It's sort of like she becomes part  of you. In the things she showed you  and taught you… The way you live  your life. Does that make sense?
Okay. We can just sit.  Whatever you want.
Of course you want to bring your  mother back. And I wish we could.  But it's not possible.
This is different. Magic can't be  used to alter the natural order of things-
(interrupting) But we don't mess with life and death.  Dawn - I know how bad you hurt-
They did, and it's awful and unfair -  but this isn't the way.
That's not the point-
Because witches can't be allowed to  alter the fabric of life that way, for  selfish reasons. We'd manipulate the  world until it came unglued. (to Dawn) You can't understand this now - I  don't expect you to… But as painful  as death is, it's part of nature. Wiccans took an oath, a long time ago, to honor that-
(firmer) Maybe "they" could, but <u>we</u> can't. Even  if it wasn't wrong, it's the most advanced  form of dark arts. Way beyond our grasp.
Take care, Dawn.
Hum?
(smiles) Sassy eggs. (then) What are you writing this for?
(re: journal) That's new.
(affectionately) Down to every last bagel.
Huh.
What happened to "History of  Witchcraft?"
Dawn must have taken it.
That book has a whole section  on resurrection spells. (worried) This is bad. This is really bad…
It doesn't have a "how to" guide,  but it refers to specific resurrection  spells and potions.
I don't know. But she could get  into major trouble with that information.  (looking around) God. What else did she take-
No. We can't waste time on that now.  Who knows what she's up to…
