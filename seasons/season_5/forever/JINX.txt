Yes, well - she bade me come to you.  The news of your relationship with the  slayer-
But you attempted to court her, did you not?
(cutting to the chase) It's just, The Lovely And- (off Ben's look) Glory would like to encourage this  interest of yours in the slayer. It  might lead to information about the Key.

(getting it) Än innocent?" The Key? That's an…  interesting choice of words.
I - I understand. I'm sorry to have  bothered you. I'll take my leave-
Of course not, sir. Now if you would-

He indicated that it was…  a person, Most… uhhh…  Highest You.
(nods) I believe so… Good One.
