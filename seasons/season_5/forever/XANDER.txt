I'm sure she just didn't want to  upset you, Dawnster. (then) Now you better get working on  that dinner. You've barely touched it.
That's a shame. 'Cause you've got  about 9000 of them in the kitchen.  You could open your very own  Casserole Hut.
(helping himself to more) Shouldn't stop you. Eating can provide  pleasant numbness.
Your Dad's still AWOL, huh?
Good. It's got flow.
You going home?
Yeah. I thought maybe I'd stop by your mom's too. (off Willow's look) Well, I'm not going to <u>my</u> house.  Those people are scary-
Speaking of.
You've got to be kidding.
And you're not leaving those. This  isn't the time for your crap, Spike.  You actually think you're going to  score points with Buffy this way?
Bull. We're all hip to your doomed  obsession. You're rising to new lows,  man. Or, lowering… towards them.
Like you care about her.
And the only one with a daughter  you wanted to shag. I'm touched.
Her mistake.
(fuming) Unbelievable. Guy thinks he can put on  a big show and con Buffy into being his  sex monkey…
Umm hum.
Yeah…
It was more… intense. Very intense, actually.
Right, I- (stops) Huh?
Yeah. I kinda picked up on that.
True. It would get kind of crowdy  and stinky on Earth if nobody vacated.
Again I say - huh?
Got it. What makes you feel more  alive than the good stuff?
(alarmed) Right. When two people are much  older and way richer and far less stupid-
Yeah. I do.
