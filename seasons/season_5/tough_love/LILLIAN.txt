Sitting in the back today, Buffy?
Thanks. The cartridge is struck.
I thought you might... I was sorry to hear of your loss.
Seems like they're trying to make it harder to get out of college than to get in.
Is there something else?
(re: slide projector) We'll let the AV guys hand that. I'm glad you like poetry, Buffy.
Maybe short poems?
Haiku?
I hope so.
