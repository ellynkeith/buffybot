I suppose you are, in a matter of speaking. You <u>were</u> born here. Your mortal self.
(looking over at them) Yes, appalling. Almost as if they no longer think money can buy happiness.
(to Buffy) So all went well at the university, I trust.
Willow, mind watching the till?
You're going to have to put your foot down with her.
No, Buffy, I don't think so.

That's the spirit.
I know you can.
(kind) No.
I hope this isn't another return. Everyone wants petrified hamsters, then they're never happy with them.
Are you all right?
Ah yes. Your good mood is both obvious and contagious.
I'm sorry.

I know it must seem bleak now, but as they say, "This too...
...shall pass."
Now, what do we have here?
Yes. How helpful.
But she's not here. What a marvelous opportunity for you and me to talk.
Actually, you're talking quite a lot. But not about the right things. Tell us why you were here.

(casual, almost sheepish) He changed his mind.
Oh God.
Willow, wait. I'll go with--
It's dreadful.
