Thank you for picking me up! I'm very grateful for the ride!
True love.
Hi!
I'm looking for Warren. Do you know where Warren is? And if you do, could you tell me?
All righty! No harm in asking! Thanks!
Hi! Do you know Warren? I need to find him.
Warren?
I heard that Warren was here. Is Warren here?
He's Warren and he's looking for me. He lost me.
Is Warren here?
I'm April. I'm looking for my fella.
Really? Where?
Oh!
That would be wrong! You are not my boyfriend!
You cannot make those suggestions to me. I have a boyfriend. Warren is my boyfriend.
No one but Warren can touch me!
Do you know my boyfriend?
I have to find him. If I hurt you just now I am sorry and I hope your boyfriend will take good care of you.
Hi! Does Warren live here?
Yes, it is! Does Warren live here?
(to the door) Okay then! Bye!
Hi!
Do you know where Warren is? I need to get to Warren.
There's only me. April.
Don't go! You have to stay and tell the truth!
You're a liar. He can't be your boyfriend. Say that he's my boyfriend!
(confused) You need to stop lying.
Warren!
(scared) Where have you been?
I couldn't find you and this girl kept lying to me, and then she went to sleep.
Please don't be angry, Warren. I'm trying very hard to make you happy.
Warren? What should I do?
Is she broken?
Warren, honey? What's going on? Why did you go away? Is it a game?
Did I do something wrong? I waited a long time and you didn't come back. A long time. I made you five sweaters.
What is she saying? What do you need to tell me?
You can't make mistakes.
But I can be whatever you want. I love you. I'll do whatever you want. Would you like a neck rub?
You took my man! I'm going to kill you! I'm going to...
I can't... can't crush... so tired...
Warren? Where are you? What's happening to me?
Crying is blackmail. Good girlfriends don't cry.
I've rechecked everything. I did everything I was supposed to do. I was a good girlfriend.
I'm only supposed to love him. If I can't do that, what am I <u>for</u>? What do I exist for?
It's getting dark. It's so early to be dark.
What if he comes back and he can't find me in the dark?
Maybe this is a girlfriend test. If I wait here patiently this time, he'll come back.
He's going to take me home and things will be right again.
When things are sad, you just have to be patient. Because... Because every cloud has a silver lining. And when life give you lemons you make lemonade...
Yes. And... and things are always darkest before...
