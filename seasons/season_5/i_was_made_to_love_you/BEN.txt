Buffy!
Actually, these are orthopedic pants. Oh man, that sounded so funny in my head.
Having a good time?
I am now.
I'm not really... good... rhythm... Sure. I'd love to. (indicates plate) I'll just go dump this... be right back.
Was that guy bothering you? Should I, um, offer to get inappropriately violent or something?
Good, 'cause, honestly... I don't wanna.
Um... first...?
Oh, yeah... my phone number. I was gonna try to work it subtly into the conversation, but... didn't pan out. And I figured I should try to give it to you <u>before</u> you see me dance.
You know, in case you want to get coffee...
Hmm. Apparently we'd be risking a tragic chain reaction, but I just really like... coffee. I think coffee might be worth it. I'd like to get to know coffee better.
(a little ragged) Hello?...
No. I just... I just got in is all. Night shift at the hospital. I'm glad you called.
Yes. Yes. Coffee would be great... tomorrow night... sure... Bye!
Oh, fine.
