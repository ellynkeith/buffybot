We've gotta go. She's gonna see me.
It doesn't matter. Come on.
I don't want to hear about your sister's place again. Pack your stuff now.
You can call her.
Katrina, if you don't want to pack, that's fine. You can buy new stuff. Now let's just go.
Is this about her?
Trina, please be quiet. This is important. Wait in the kitchen.
I can't.
Shut up, Trina!
Yes. I know. April. Did she hurt someone?
She's looking for me, you know. She followed me here.
There's more. Something you need to know about her.
No, wait. Something important.
No. This is something you can't possibly know.
She's a robot.
Well, yeah, I felt like I deserve to have someone, you know? Everyone deserves to have someone.
Kinda.
She's not a toy. I mean, I know what you're thinking. But she's more than that.
No! I mean, I made her to love me. She cares about what I care about and she wants to be with me. She listens to me and supports me. I didn't make a toy, I made a girlfriend.
I really thought I would be. I mean, she's perfect. But it's just... I don't know. It was too easy and predictable. She got boring. She was exactly what I wanted and I didn't want her. I thought I was going crazy.
Then something happened. Katrina was in my engineering seminar, and she was really funny and cool -- she was always giving me a hard time, real unpredictable. She builds these little model monorails that run with magnets. Anyway, I fell in love with Katrina.
Kind of.
Um... okay... I didn't really dump her so much as I... went out and didn't come back. I left her... I left her in my dorm room.
I figured if I could just kinda get away 'til her batteries gave up, which should have been days ago...
I didn't need to fix anything! Her batteries were supposed to run down, really! They should completely be dead by now!
I don't know. Maybe... maybe she's recharging them somehow.
She's only programmed to be in love.
She's looking for me. So my guess is she's probably pretty close.
(calls) April? April, are you there? (to Buffy) If the batteries are still working, and she hears my voice, she'll answer.
Well, I made it so if she heard me and she didn't answer... it causes this kind of feedback.
(calls) April!
April.
April... what did you do?
Put her down. This is Buffy. Give Katrina to Buffy.
Thank God.
No. This isn't a game.
That's great. You could go back there and get them. You could wait there--
April. It was my mistake.
But I did. I thought I made you everything I wanted. But it wasn't what I really wanted.
(on Robot vision) I'm sorry. But it's over.
April, I know you love me, but the truth is, I can't love you. It isn't your fault, but... I don't love you.
(on Robot vision) I love <u>her</u>!
Trina! Get away!
She wasn't just for sex!
Katrina! No! Listen to me...!
(into phone) Trina? No, wait... I'm so sorry... Yes, I am so... just give me a chance to explain... yes... no... yes, but... Really, I'll do anything. No! Don't hang up!
How'd you get in here?
I'm not making any more girls.
