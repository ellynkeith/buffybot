I'm not sure. Once more.
(to Buffy) Was that five or four-and-a-half?
I like it.
Oh. That was why I liked it.
Maybe he's a gigolo. Was his shirt all shiny?
So, what's the plan for tonight?
I think a date should be in a real fancy restaurant, then champagne at a night club with a floor show, then ballroom dancing.
(to Buffy) You're going to that Spring Break party tonight, right? Maybe you'll meet someone there.
Spin again. Real fast this time.
What the heck is going on out here?
I'm for it. How was the date?
You gonna see him again?
Irritated Giles. I'm beginning to get why Buffy likes it so much.
A robot? Really? Is it Ted? 'Cuz I always said there could've been more than one of him.
(clenched teeth) Get away from me.
