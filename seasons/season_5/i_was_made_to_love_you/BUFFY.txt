Spike! Spike wants me. how obscene is that?
I feel gross, you know? Like, dirty.
Aren't I? Responsible? I mean, it had to be something about me that did it, right? Something that made Spike say... "Woof, that's the one for me."
Oh! Puffy Xander! I got carried away. You okay?
Do you want to sit down?
Comfy?
See, that's my secret to attracting me. It's simple. I slap 'em around a bit, torture 'em, make their lives hell...
...Sure, the nice guys'll run away, but every now and then you'll find a prince like Spike who gets off on it--
But... I just... I just want to know that there's gonna be another one, another good one. One that I won't chase away.
Great. And the minute after that I can terrify him with my alarming strength and remarkable self- involvement.
Maybe I can change. You know, work harder, spend less time Slaying, laugh at his jokes-- Men like that, don't they? The joke-laughing-at?
That's... that's really...
Mmm?
I might like it more than the others. Spin again.
Now the other way.
Just wanted to see how many time you'd do it.
You're both crazy! It's not mom-ish at all! It's sexy! It screams randy-sex- kitten-buy-me-one-drink-and-I'll... Wait... that's not good either.
(checks her watch) Four-twenty-three. You have lots of time 'til seven. Vast acres of time in which you could plant crops so tell us all about this Brian and guy and what his intentions are.
I've heard of those.
Oh no, Love-Doctor Buffy is not in. I'm not qualified to give dating advice. I've had exactly two boyfriends and they both left. Really left. Left town left.
Right. Or maybe Brian has a son and Mom and me can go on some unspeakably awkward double dates.
Four twenty-four.
You know? I really am. Dancing with you is way better than trying to hook up with some good-looking guy.
Ben, I didn't know you were here! And again with the non-medical clothing!
It is funny! Very, very funny in my head too.
Yeah. I was dancing earlier and my friends are here-- (catching herself) But this isn't all about me. Are you enjoying yourself?
Would, um, would you like to dance or something?
I told you--
(clenched) Get away from me.
That's okay.
So, ready to dance?
What's that?
Oh! That's... thank you! But I should tell you, I've got this kind of bad history. Where we have coffee and, well, it ends up with you leaving town, and you just got here and everything--
Then I'll call you.
(cautiously) Hi... Listen... maybe you and I should talk. Because, throwing Spike through a window, that's... well, that's good. But in general--
Okay, I think you need to take a second to stop looking for your boyfriend--
Ow. I don't know about you guys, but I've had it with super-strong little women who aren't me.
So, what the deal with the girl? I mean, what is she? 'Cuz this may sound nuts, but I had this real strong impression she was a...
I was gonna say robot. Okay, so what does she want?
Willow, can you track this guy down with just a first name?
Fine. We find Warren tomorrow. Tonight I better go rescue Giles. He's watching Dawn while Mom's on her date, and I get the feeling there's only so much he can take.
What did she make you do?
I'm so sorry, but if it makes you feel any better, my fun-time-Buffy party night involved watching a robot throw Spike through a window, so if you want to trade... no wait, I wouldn't give up that memory for anything.
We're going to work on it in the morning. Or, if you wanted to hang out a little longer, you and I could--
...listen to Mom talk about boys.
I don't know, I was standing right there. I didn't see Prince Charming. I didn't see a good- night kiss. It all looked pretty tame to me.
What?
Mother!
Good God! That's horrible! Don't do that!
No more! No more!
Absolutely.
Willow already checked the Sunnydale enrollment.
Hey, the no-research angle likes me just fine. But I'm still gonna have to --
I'll go talk to him.
Oh, come on! The guy's a big wedge of sleaze! Don't make excuses for him.
Hi. It's Buffy. This a bad time? It's kinda early.
Well, I found your phone number in my pocket and I thought I might as well pick up the phone a couple times and hang up and finally call to see if you want to, you know, have that coffee or, whatever, whatever you want to do.
I have to talk to you.
Yes.
My name is Buffy Summers. You were at Sunnydale High. Do you know who I am?
Not yet. Well, no one that matters.
Okay, kinda figured that out.
I know.
Believe me, I worked it out.
Y'uh-huh.
They don't want to talk to you, you're not getting dates, and you start thinking, "this isn't fair."
So, naturally, you turned to manufacturing.
How long did it take you to build yourself that little toy?
I'm sure there are many exciting labor-saving attachments--
A girlfriend? Are you saying you two... are you in love with her?
Really? You?
Swell. Romance and magnet trains. But first, you took April out of the box, played with her for five minutes and got bored. So what did you do, dump her? Tell her to go away?
And she got mad? Wouldn't go?
You left her in your dorm room?!
Did you even tell her? Did you even give her a chance to fix what was wrong?
So why aren't they?
Listen, Warren, this is important. Is she dangerous?
Then she's dangerous. You have any idea how to find her?
She's, like, voice-activated?
If you call her and she doesn't answer, it hurts her. You're one creepy little dweeb, Warrenâ€¦
April. I want you to put the girl down.
(to Warren) Talk to her.
She's alive.
Warren. You have to tell her. Do it right.
(to Warren) She growls? You made her so she growls?
Can you cry? I feel better if I cry sometimes. But, I don't know, maybe there's rust issues...
Oh.
I'm sure you were.
I don't know. It isn't fair. He wasn't fair to you.
Yeah.
I'm here. I'll make sure he finds you.
I'm sure he will. And he's going to say... he'll say that he's so sorry. He told me... He said he was proud of you and impressed with how much you love him and try to help him. He didn't mean to hurt you.
It'll be fine.
Clouds and lemonade.
Yeah?
"Shimmed?" Is that a word? Do you really know what you're talking about?
And if you ever get your own business, you've got a slogan right there. (then) She wasn't crazed.
She was just... she devoted everything to making this one person happy. And then it was like, with him gone, there wasn't any reason for her to exist any more.
Nah -- people are the strangest people. I mean, I'm not that different from her. I've got so much more than her -- I've got this great life, all this power, all these friends, my family, but still, every time I don't have a boyfriend, I feel like someone took away my arms.
Well, kinda. I feel like something real important is missing. But it isn't. I mean, it is missing, but it isn't that important, you know?
No, see, I'm serious. I don't need a guy right now. I need me. If someone amazing comes along, fine, but I think I'd like to get comfortable being alone with Buffy.
Thanks.
Hi. This is Buffy. I hope this is your machine... there wasn't a greeting, but anyway, about the going out for coffee...
