I don't see why we have to patrol just 'cause Buffy's away. I'd rather stay home and watch television. It's often funnier than killing stuff.
Fine! Thank you for asking.
You're back very early.
You were right.
Phffft. I breathed in like a quart of vampire dust. That can't be good.
Oh you know, Slayer-Watcher stuff. Probably some silly ritual with an enchanted prairie dog or something.
She fought okay.
That's true.
I think this is where we were.
I heard something.
Buffy's boinking Spike.
In the movies, when someone goes crazy, they slap 'em.
Xander! I was scared. Are you hurt? What happened?
Wow. The big guns. Only not guns. (then) Shouldn't we have guns?
And maybe change your clothes? You know, something moreâ€¦ fighty!
And what do we do with Glory?
It's wrong.
We're just kinda thrown by the, you having sex with Spike.
Okay that's denial. That comes before anger.
Anger.
She's very well done.
We were getting weapons.
If he told her he'd just lie to us about it anyway, right?
Bleah. It's very complicated in there. Personally, I'd rather look at guts.
