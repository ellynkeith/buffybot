You don't have to help, Giles. You cooked.
Hey, Dawn? If there's any dishes in your room, let's have 'em before they get  furry and we have to name them.
Okay. Some minutes are harder than others.
It has to.
I don't know. I've been thinking about maybe taking a break or something.
And you were great, helping me and everything… (bites the bullet) But I've been feeling kind of uneasy about stuff.
Training, slaying… All of it. I mean, I can beat up demons until the cows come home, and then I can beat up the cows, but I'm not sure I like what it's doing to me.
Yeah, strength and resilience, those are like words for hardness. I'm starting to feel like, like being the Slayer is sort of turning me to stone.
I'm just… look, think about it. I was never really <u>there</u> for Riley, not like I was for Angel. I was terrible to Dawn…
Before that. Riley left because I was shut down. He's gone and Mom's gone and I really loved her, but I don't know if I… if I let her know…
I don't know. To slay, to kill, you have to be kind of hard inside. Maybe being the perfect Slayer means being too hard to love at all. I already feel like I can hardly say the words.
I love you, Giles. Love love love Giles. Yuck. It feels strange.
Ten. Serious to the amount of ten.
A quest. Like find a grail or something?
I can't leave Dawn here. Not with Glory looking for her.
But I can't go. (to Dawn) I'm not leaving you here.
I love you, Dawn. You know that, right?
I love you. Really love you.
Sorry. But - it's important that I tell you. Weird love is better than no love.
What's in the trunk?
I was wondering about that. Food and water, maybe a compass?
Don't think I'll be <u>that</u> hungry.
A Guide, but no water or food. So it leads me to the sacred place and then a week later it leads you to my bleached bones?
So, how does it start?
Hey, I think I know this ritual. The ancient shamans were next called upon to do the Hokey-Pokey and to turn themselves around-
(mock-gravity) And that's what it's all about.
Well. Hello kitty.
I know this place…
Hello? Who's there?
I know you. You're the first Slayer.
I… um… Okay. I have a question. This Slayer thing. What about… love? Not just boyfriend love-
I didn't say that. (beat) Yes.
Does it?
I'm full of love? I'm not losing it?
Yes.
My what? Sorry… It's just, I got a little lost when we got to the gift department…
Yeah, that's what you said, alright.
Angel's lame. His hair goes straight up and he's bloody stupid.
What? I'm sorry, but I'm just not getting this. I'm full of love. Which is nice to know. And then… love will lead me to my gift?
I'm getting a gift? Or do you mean I have a gift to give to someone else?
Death is my gift.
Okay. No. Death is not a gift. My mother just died and I know about this. It's not a gift I want and it's not a gift I want to give to anyone else. If I have to kill demons because it helps the world, then I kill demons, but it's not a <u>gift</u> to anybody.
Whoa. Group play time.
Didn't seem like it to me. Death is my gift. Pffah!
What happened? Is Dawn okay?
Blame? There's blame now?
The who whatting how with huh?
I am not having sex with Spike!
I am not having sex with Spike, but I'm starting to think you are.
Oh my God.
No. That's a robot. She acts just like that girlfriend-bot that Warren guy made! You couldn't tell me apart from a <u>robot</u>?!
(hurt) I get it. Fine. Robot. Fine.
(genuine horror) Oh God.
No! Stop imagining! All of you!
Glory has Spike?
Grab 'em. We're going <u>now</u>. I have to kill him.
No. I have to <u>kill</u> him.
I know where to start.
Okay, Glory's Key-sniffing snake was about here when I killed it, and it was headed back to her.
It's all we have.
Listen, skirt-girl, we're not going to "save" him, we're going to "kill" him. He knows who the Key is and there's no way he's not telling Glory.
(to the group) Split up, spread out. Check out the priciest-looking places first. Xander, come with me. Willow and Anya, go together. And- (pronounces it with a hard 'G') <u>G</u>iles, dyeh… (pronounces it right) Giles, you can watch… it.
Oh yeah. At least it's not a very good copy. I mean, look at it.
(to Giles and Xander) What did you do with Spike? And please let the story have a dusty ending.
We know where she <u>lived</u>. She's gotta be long gone by now. Did he tell Glory -
Oh, you can count on that. But we gotta know. Now. If he did give us up, Dawn and I are gonna have to get out of town, or… I mean, she could be on her way.
Xander, please don't be suggesting what I'd have to kill you for suggesting.
Spike! You're covered in sexy wounds!
The robot is gone. The robot was gross and obscene.
Don't. That <u>thing</u>… it's not even real.
