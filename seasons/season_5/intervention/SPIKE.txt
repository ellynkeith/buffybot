Some say it's better than the real thing.
She looks good, but what about the rest? A little talk, a little walk,  perhaps a zippy cartwheel…?
All the extra programming, right?
Wait. I'm not sure I'm a satisfied customer. She looks a little shiny to me. You know, a touch of  plasticine…
(simply) She'll do.
What are you searching for, Slayer? A weak spot? Try me. Give me the best you've got.
Why not?
Maybe I should repay you for your gentleness. Maybe I should let you go.
You know you should be afraid of me. I'm bad.
You gonna do it that way?
You can't do it.
Buffy.
And that excites you?
Yeah?
For how long? How long have you  felt it?
Are you afraid of me?
You know I can't bite you.
Like this?
All right.
You're mine, Buffy.
Shh. No programs. Don't use that word. Just be Buffy.
Yeah, mmmppphm.
Hey there! Wait up!
Yes. Um… hallo all. Buffy came back early, I see. Lots of patrolling all  'round tonight then, is it?
(surprised) Yeah, guess so.
(to Xander and Anya) I think that was probably the big action for tonight. You two can toddle on home if you want.
Satisfied.
Always.
I can do that.
Down there. And no matter what,  don't come out 'til I get you, okay?
Oh, it's you.
Yeah? Can't see how it's any business of yours-
She's upset about her mum, and if she turns to me for comfort… well I'm not gonna deny it to her, I'm not a monster.
Well, yeah. Got me there.
(to Xander) Friends of yours?
Hey! Let go!
Key? Who's a Key? I'm not the f-
Damn right I'm impure, I'm as impure as the driven yellow snow! Let me go!
So, I'm just gonna let myself out…
Sod off.
(lip still held) Hey. Easy with the lip.
Enough. No more. I'll tell you who the soddin' Key is.
Yeah, okay. The Key. Well, here's the thing…
It's that guy. On TV. What's his name?
On that show, the Price show, where they guess what stuff costs--
Yeah, but it was fun. And guess what, bitch? I'm not telling you jack. You're never gonna get your sodding Key  because you might be strong, but in our world, you're an idiot-
The God of What? Bad home perms?
Yeah, okay. I mean, sorry, but I just had no idea Gods were such prancing lightweights.
Mark my words, the Slayer is going to kick your skanky lop-sided ass back to whatever place would take a cheap, whorish, fashion victim ex-God like you.
(in pain) Good plan, Spike. Fabulous bloody plan.
Oh, God.
Yeah, they feel real sexy. Where ya been?
Will fixed you? I'd a thought they'd melt you into scrap.
Give us a minute. I got some bones need mending.
She wanted to know who the Key was.
No!
Buffy - the other… the not-as-pleasant Buffy. Something happened to Dawn  it'd destroy her. I couldn't live, her being in that much pain. I'd let Glory kill me first. Nearly bloody did.
It wasn't supposed to be -
