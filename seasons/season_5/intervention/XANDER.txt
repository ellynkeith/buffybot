That's it? We're all protected up for the night?
She's really smart.
So when the wiz kid gets back from Chem Lab, you can have her, you know, bulk up the spell a little if you want, maybe while me and Anya go do a  quick patrol.
Buffy?
I guess.
Yeah, how was the whole vision quest experience?
Are you all right? You're all… I'm  liking the skirt, by the way… but what happened to the quest?
We haven't seen any vamps… are you sure there's-
Um… Buffy?
I wish Giles told us they were back from the desert. I wish I knew what went on there.
Whatever it was, I think she's still a little spacy.
Yeah…
Something's wrong.
I guess she went-
Where's Dawn?
Good.
Buffy's gone insane.
Brace yourself, you're not gonna believe it.
I'm gonna go find her, talk to her. If she's losing it, we need to help her before she gets herself hurt.
No, but if I have to see her straddle Spike again I will definitely knock myself unconscious.
I saw you. In the cemetery, with Buffy.
It's my business because Buffy is my friend. And she's been through some stuff lately that's… well it's affected her and you're taking advantage of her.
Yes! You are a monster. Vampires are monsters! They make monster movies about them!
Spike, Buffy has lots of friends and we all love her. We're ready to do whatever it takes to protect her and if it means killing you, then, well, that's just a bonus…
Guys. Demon-y kinds of guys. Buffy?
The guys that work for Glory? You said they were kinda like Hobbits with  leprosy? Well, this was a whole flock of Hobbits and they grabbed Spike. I think they're taking him to Glory.
(to Buffybot) So how do we find him?
Yeah, I got nothing. We'll hit your place, stock up.
If we're going to stop Spike from blabbing about Dawn, we're going to need these.
Yeah. So we should look…?
Okay, Buff, it's okay. You're right.  You shouldn't have to know everything.
Okay. This has gone way too far. She thinks we're going to <u>rescue</u> Spike!
Find him. Stop him from talking. Whatever it takes.
Then we're gonna have to talk to her.
Yeah. 'Cause what we need right now is a <u>sane</u> Buffy.
Buffy. We have to talk.
Buffy, we care about you. And we're worried about you. The way you're acting, the things you're doing…
No one is judging you. It's  understandable. Spike is strong and mysterious and sort of compact but well-muscled-
Buffy. I saw you. Anya too. We saw you and Spike. With the straddling.
And so say all of us.
Hey! I know this! They're <u>both</u> Buffy!
Spike must have had her built so he could program her to…
(raising hand) Already got the visual.
We were gonna bring that up.
We figured, any way we could stop him from talking…
That's not a lot to go on.
We dumped him back in his crypt.
We don't know. He was barely conscious.
God, I feel kinda bad for the guy. Gets all whupped, then his best toy gets taken away…
No, no! Travesty! Completely on board. It's just… guy was so thrashed… just not his day.
