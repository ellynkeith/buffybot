BUFFY: You don't have to help, Giles. You cooked.
GILES: Nonsense. I quite like to cook, and helping out with the dishes makes me feel useful.
DAWN: Wanna clean out the garage with us Saturday? You could feel indispensable.
GILES: How… tempting.
BUFFY: Hey, Dawn? If there's any dishes in your room, let's have 'em before they get  furry and we have to name them.
DAWN: Hey, I was like, five then.
GILES: How is she doing?
BUFFY: Okay. Some minutes are harder than others.
GILES: I'm so sorry. I can only say, it will get better.
BUFFY: It has to.
GILES: Good. Routine can be very helpful…  In fact, maybe we should consider  returning to our training schedule.
BUFFY: I don't know. I've been thinking about maybe taking a break or something.
GILES: You were doing so well.
BUFFY: And you were great, helping me and everything… (bites the bullet) But I've been feeling kind of uneasy about stuff.
GILES: Like what?
BUFFY: Training, slaying… All of it. I mean, I can beat up demons until the cows come home, and then I can beat up the cows, but I'm not sure I like what it's doing to me.
GILES: But you've mastered so much. Your strength and resilience are -
BUFFY: Yeah, strength and resilience, those are like words for hardness. I'm starting to feel like, like being the Slayer is sort of turning me to stone.
GILES: Turning you to stone? Buffy…?
BUFFY: I'm just… look, think about it. I was never really <u>there</u> for Riley, not like I was for Angel. I was terrible to Dawn…
GILES: Look, at a time like this you're bound to feel emotionally numb -
BUFFY: Before that. Riley left because I was shut down. He's gone and Mom's gone and I really loved her, but I don't know if I… if I let her know…
GILES: She knew. Always.
BUFFY: I don't know. To slay, to kill, you have to be kind of hard inside. Maybe being the perfect Slayer means being too hard to love at all. I already feel like I can hardly say the words.
GILES: Buffy-
BUFFY: I love you, Giles. Love love love Giles. Yuck. It feels strange.
GILES: I shouldn't wonder. (then) How serious are you about this?
BUFFY: Ten. Serious to the amount of ten.
GILES: There is something. In the Watcher's Diaries. A Quest.
BUFFY: A quest. Like find a grail or something?
GILES: Not a grail. Maybe some answers. It would take a day, perhaps two. As your Watcher, I'd be part of it. There's an incantation.
BUFFY: I can't leave Dawn here. Not with Glory looking for her.
DAWN: What's the deal?
GILES: A quest. Some of the Slayers before Buffy found it helpful in regaining their focus, learning more about their role. There's a sacred location in the nearby desert.
DAWN: A sacred place near the Hellmouth?
GILES: That's fairly common, actually. Sort of an equalization of forces.
BUFFY: But I can't go. (to Dawn) I'm not leaving you here.
DAWN: If you need to learn… I mean if it'll help you out, I think you should do it. I can hang out with the gang…
BUFFY: I love you, Dawn. You know that, right?
DAWN: Yeah. I love you too.
BUFFY: I love you. Really love you.
DAWN: Gettin' weird.
BUFFY: Sorry. But - it's important that I tell you. Weird love is better than no love.
SPIKE: Some say it's better than the real thing.
WARREN: Better than the real thing.
SPIKE: She looks good, but what about the rest? A little talk, a little walk,  perhaps a zippy cartwheel…?
WARREN: Hey, she's great. You'll be real happy, I swear. She's got everything you asked for, the extra programming, tons of real world knowledge, the profiles you gave me about her family and friends.
SPIKE: All the extra programming, right?
WARREN: (uncomfortable) The stuff you wanted. The scenario responses, the, you know, special skills… all of it. Now, you said I could leave  town when she was done, and she's-
SPIKE: Wait. I'm not sure I'm a satisfied customer. She looks a little shiny to me. You know, a touch of  plasticine…
BUFFYBOT: Spike! Oh, Spike!
SPIKE: (simply) She'll do.
GLORY: He's getting stronger. I'm losing him. I'm losing control of him.
JINX: You are speaking of Ben, Most  Glamorous Yet Tasteful One?
GLORY: He stabbed you! In your body! Oh, Jinxy, that's not on the dance card! That's not supposed to happen! He's a (distasteful) person. He's not supposed to do that.
MURK: Jinx is all right, your Highness. And we have the new knowledge that the Key is a human being.
GLORY: And Jinx will stay all right until Ben finds out that he's not dead, that we know his secret. Then Ben will try to stop all of us!
JINX: What do we do?
GLORY: We hurry. Scamper scamper. If time runs out on us and all we're left with  is info, then we're screwed.
JINX: Oh, surely not.
GLORY: No. We're screwed.
MURK: But you're a God! The Sacred Glorificus!
GLORY: I'm a God in exile. Far from the Hellfires of Home and sharing my body with an enemy that stabs my boys in their fleshy little <u>stomachs</u>!
JINX: (through discomfort) How can we help? We'll lay down our lives!
GLORY: The Slayer and the Key are connected. She is going to have contact with it. Find out who is new in her life, who is special, who is different. Watch her.
MURK: We can do that, Oh Thou.
GLORY: She could give it a nickel on a street corner, or bump into it on a bus or share a creamy chocolate shake with it at the soda fountain. I want to hear about everyone she has contact with. That girl has my Key and I'm trusting you boys to get it for me. If you love me, get it for me.
BUFFY: What's in the trunk?
GILES: Supplies.
BUFFY: I was wondering about that. Food and water, maybe a compass?
GILES: How about a book, a gourd and a bundle of twigs.
BUFFY: Don't think I'll be <u>that</u> hungry.
GILES: They're for me. You see, the location of the sacred spot is a guarded secret. I can't take you there myself. I have to perform a ritual that will turn over my guardianship of you, temporarily, to a Guide…
BUFFY: A Guide, but no water or food. So it leads me to the sacred place and then a week later it leads you to my bleached bones?
GILES: Buffy, really. It takes more than a week to bleach bones.
BUFFY: So, how does it start?
GILES: (embarrassed) I… jump out of the circle, jump back in, and, and, shake my gourd.
BUFFY: Hey, I think I know this ritual. The ancient shamans were next called upon to do the Hokey-Pokey and to turn themselves around-
GILES: Go. Quest.
BUFFY: (mock-gravity) And that's what it's all about.
SPIKE: What are you searching for, Slayer? A weak spot? Try me. Give me the best you've got.
BUFFYBOT: No.
SPIKE: Why not?
BUFFYBOT: I want to hurt you, but I can't resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular body.
SPIKE: Maybe I should repay you for your gentleness. Maybe I should let you go.
BUFFYBOT: No! Spike! Never let me go!
SPIKE: You know you should be afraid of me. I'm bad.
BUFFYBOT: You are. You're very very bad.
SPIKE: You gonna do it that way?
BUFFYBOT: No. This way.
SPIKE: You can't do it.
BUFFYBOT: I could never do it. I'm helpless against you, you fiend.
SPIKE: Buffy.
GILES: (Swahili) …nilivyoahidi kulinda na  kuongoza, nakupokeza. Mpeleke afike mahali pa usalama na ujuzi. Mpe anavyohitaji. Mwonyeshe njia  (English) …that which I am pledged to guard and guide, I hand over to you. Lead her to a place of safety and learning. Give her that which she needs. Show her the path…
BUFFY: Well. Hello kitty.
BUFFY: I know this place…
TARA: Okay. Warning spell's all set.
XANDER: That's it? We're all protected up for the night?
TARA: Well, it's probably not as good as Willow could do. (proudly) You wouldn't believe how quick she picks this stuff up.
XANDER: She's really smart.
TARA: She's more than that. She's a natural with magic. In just the time I've  known her, she's already blown right past me.
XANDER: So when the wiz kid gets back from Chem Lab, you can have her, you know, bulk up the spell a little if you want, maybe while me and Anya go do a  quick patrol.
ANYA: I don't see why we have to patrol just 'cause Buffy's away. I'd rather stay home and watch television. It's often funnier than killing stuff.
DAWN: So guys, if this is a real slumber party, where's the pizza?
BUFFYBOT: You're evil.
SPIKE: And that excites you?
BUFFYBOT: It excites me. It terrifies me. I try so hard to resist you, and I can't.
SPIKE: Yeah?
BUFFYBOT: Darn your sinister attraction!
SPIKE: For how long? How long have you  felt it?
BUFFYBOT: Since the beginning. I always trembled when I heard your voice.
SPIKE: Are you afraid of me?
BUFFYBOT: Yes.
SPIKE: You know I can't bite you.
BUFFYBOT: I think you can. I think you can if I let you. And I want to let you. I want you to bite me and devour me until there's no more.
SPIKE: Like this?
BUFFYBOT: Oh! Spike! Devour me.
SPIKE: All right.
BUFFYBOT: Spike! I can't help myself! I love you!
SPIKE: You're mine, Buffy.
BUFFYBOT: Should I start this program over?
SPIKE: Shh. No programs. Don't use that word. Just be Buffy.
WILLOW: It's got last week's notes too. Just get it back to me by Thursday. And don't, uh, write in it, or put a coffee mug down on it… or spill… okay.
BUFFYBOT: Time to Slay.
SPIKE: Yeah, mmmppphm.
BUFFYBOT: Okay! Vampires beware!
BUFFYBOT: Hey there!
XANDER: Buffy?
BUFFYBOT: Xander! And…
ANYA: Fine! Thank you for asking.
BUFFYBOT: Isn't it a beautiful night for killing evil things?
XANDER: I guess.
ANYA: You're back very early.
XANDER: Yeah, how was the whole vision quest experience?
BUFFYBOT: I don't understand that question, but thank you for asking! You're my friend and a carpenter.
XANDER: Are you all right? You're all… I'm  liking the skirt, by the way… but what happened to the quest?
SPIKE: Hey there! Wait up!
BUFFYBOT: (delighted) Spike! It's Spike! And he's wearing the coat!
SPIKE: Yes. Um… hallo all. Buffy came back early, I see. Lots of patrolling all  'round tonight then, is it?
XANDER: We haven't seen any vamps… are you sure there's-
ANYA: You were right.
SPIKE: (surprised) Yeah, guess so.
BUFFYBOT: Spike! Be careful!
BUFFYBOT: No! Get away from him!
SPIKE: (to Xander and Anya) I think that was probably the big action for tonight. You two can toddle on home if you want.
XANDER: Um… Buffy?
BUFFYBOT: Yes! Spike and I will do it alone. You guys head home.
SPIKE: Satisfied.
BUFFYBOT: But I'm not. I'm all… my skin is all hot. Do I look hot to you?
SPIKE: Always.
BUFFYBOT: You better feel me to make sure.
SPIKE: I can do that.
ANYA: Phffft. I breathed in like a quart of vampire dust. That can't be good.
XANDER: I wish Giles told us they were back from the desert. I wish I knew what went on there.
ANYA: Oh you know, Slayer-Watcher stuff. Probably some silly ritual with an enchanted prairie dog or something.
XANDER: Whatever it was, I think she's still a little spacy.
ANYA: She fought okay.
XANDER: Yeah…
ANYA: That's true.
XANDER: Something's wrong.
ANYA: I think this is where we were.
XANDER: I guess she went-
ANYA: I heard something.
BUFFYBOT: You're the Big Bad! You're the Big Bad!
WILLOW: (re: the program) Those darn Salem judges! With their less-Satanic-than-thou attitudes…
TARA: Oh. Honey. Let me change it. The Discovery channel has koala bears.
XANDER: Where's Dawn?
TARA: She's in the bedroom. She fell asleep.
XANDER: Good.
WILLOW: What's going on?
XANDER: Buffy's gone insane.
WILLOW: What? What did she do?
XANDER: Brace yourself, you're not gonna believe it.
TARA: Everyone, before you jump all over her… people do strange things when someone they love dies. When I lost my mother I did some pretty dumb stuff, lying to my folks and staying out all night-
ANYA: Buffy's boinking Spike.
WILLOW: (struggling to understand) Oh. Well, Tara's right, grief can be powerful and we shouldn't judge -
TARA: What are you, kidding? She's nuts!
WILLOW: It's not healthy. We're all agreeing there.
TARA: What can we do?
ANYA: In the movies, when someone goes crazy, they slap 'em.
XANDER: I'm gonna go find her, talk to her. If she's losing it, we need to help her before she gets herself hurt.
TARA: You aren't really going to slap her, are you?
XANDER: No, but if I have to see her straddle Spike again I will definitely knock myself unconscious.
BUFFY: Hello? Who's there?
BUFFYBOT: Who's that?
SPIKE: Down there. And no matter what,  don't come out 'til I get you, okay?
BUFFYBOT: (cheerful) Okay!
SPIKE: Oh, it's you.
XANDER: I saw you. In the cemetery, with Buffy.
SPIKE: Yeah? Can't see how it's any business of yours-
XANDER: It's my business because Buffy is my friend. And she's been through some stuff lately that's… well it's affected her and you're taking advantage of her.
SPIKE: She's upset about her mum, and if she turns to me for comfort… well I'm not gonna deny it to her, I'm not a monster.
XANDER: Yes! You are a monster. Vampires are monsters! They make monster movies about them!
SPIKE: Well, yeah. Got me there.
XANDER: Spike, Buffy has lots of friends and we all love her. We're ready to do whatever it takes to protect her and if it means killing you, then, well, that's just a bonus…
JINX: I'm so sorry to intrude, but I wondered if I could beg a minute of your time?
SPIKE: (to Xander) Friends of yours?
JINX: Tie his hands. Glory will want him restrained.
SPIKE: Hey! Let go!
JINX: (to Murk) Careful with him. She will want the Key intact.
SPIKE: Key? Who's a Key? I'm not the f-
BUFFY: I know you. You're the first Slayer.
PRIMITIVE: This is a form. I am the Guide.
BUFFY: I… um… Okay. I have a question. This Slayer thing. What about… love? Not just boyfriend love-
PRIMITIVE: You think you're losing your ability to love.
BUFFY: I didn't say that. (beat) Yes.
PRIMITIVE: You're afraid that being the Slayer means losing your humanity.
BUFFY: Does it?
PRIMITIVE: You are full of love. You love with all of your soul. It's brighter than the fire, blinding. That's why you pull away from it.
BUFFY: I'm full of love? I'm not losing it?
PRIMITIVE: Only if you reject it. Love is pain and the Slayer forges strength from pain.
BUFFY: Yes.
PRIMITIVE: Love. Give. Forgive. Risk the pain. It is your nature. Love will bring  you to your gift.
BUFFY: My what? Sorry… It's just, I got a little lost when we got to the gift department…
PRIMITIVE: Love will bring you to your gift.
BUFFY: Yeah, that's what you said, alright.
BUFFYBOT: Spike? I waited like you said, but then I missed you!
WILLOW: Xander, what took so-
BUFFYBOT: Spike's gone.
WILLOW: Shh. Buffy, it's late. Come in…
BUFFYBOT: I don't know where Xander is. I  didn't see him. And when I came up  from the tunnel, Spike was gone! Oh… (finding the name) Willow, I need to find him.
WILLOW: Um… Buffy? This thing with Spike. It isn't true, is it? You didn't really, you know, sleep with Spike.
BUFFYBOT: No. But I had sex with Spike. I'm sorry if it bothers you. You're my best friend.
WILLOW: I am. I always will be, too, no matter what you do. And I'm trying to figure out why this happened. And I think I might have an idea.
BUFFYBOT: You do?
WILLOW: I think maybe, with your mom and everything, everyone was being all sympathetic, making you feel weak. But Spike wasn't like that. So, just one time, you kind of did something crazy-
BUFFYBOT: It wasn't one time. It was lots of times. And lots of different ways. I could make sketches.
WILLOW: No! Buffy. There's something seriously wrong here. I mean, yeah, you've been with a vampire before, but Angel had a soul-
BUFFY: Angel's lame. His hair goes straight up and he's bloody stupid.
WILLOW: O-kay. Look, I just want to help you. Let me help you.
BUFFYBOT: You're my best friend.
WILLOW: Yes, again, I really am. And I think maybe you need to talk to someone about this. A professional-
BUFFYBOT: You're recently gay!
WILLOW: Um… what?
BUFFYBOT: You're also good with computers! (then) That's very nice.
WILLOW: Um-
ANYA: Xander! I was scared. Are you hurt? What happened?
XANDER: Guys. Demon-y kinds of guys. Buffy?
BUFFYBOT: Yes? That's me!
XANDER: The guys that work for Glory? You said they were kinda like Hobbits with  leprosy? Well, this was a whole flock of Hobbits and they grabbed Spike. I think they're taking him to Glory.
WILLOW: But he knows about Dawn!
BUFFYBOT: We have to get him back.
XANDER: (to Buffybot) So how do we find him?
BUFFYBOT: I fight with weapons!
XANDER: Yeah, I got nothing. We'll hit your place, stock up.
WILLOW: Tara, will you stay and watch over Dawny?
TARA: Of course.
WILLOW: And don't let her know about…
TARA: Yeah. I plan to skip that subject.
BUFFY: What? I'm sorry, but I'm just not getting this. I'm full of love. Which is nice to know. And then… love will lead me to my gift?
PRIMITIVE: Yes.
BUFFY: I'm getting a gift? Or do you mean I have a gift to give to someone else?
PRIMITIVE: Death is your gift.
BUFFY: Death is my gift.
PRIMITIVE: Death is your gift.
BUFFY: Okay. No. Death is not a gift. My mother just died and I know about this. It's not a gift I want and it's not a gift I want to give to anyone else. If I have to kill demons because it helps the world, then I kill demons, but it's not a <u>gift</u> to anybody.
PRIMITIVE: Your question has been answered.
GLORY: What the Hell is that and why is its hair that color?
MURK: Stunning One, we believe he is…
JINX: (proudly) The Key!
GLORY: (fake glee) Really? That's fantabulous! And impossible! (then) He can't be the Key. Because, see, the Key has to be pure. This is a Vampire. Lesson number one,  <u>Vampires equal impure</u>!
SPIKE: Damn right I'm impure, I'm as impure as the driven yellow snow! Let me go!
GLORY: (to Jinx) Can't even brain-suck a vampire.  He's completely useless.
SPIKE: So, I'm just gonna let myself out…
JINX: But, Your Unholiness, we observed the Slayer. She protected this one above all others. She treated him as precious.
GLORY: Really? Precious?
SPIKE: Sod off.
GLORY: He doesn't look very fancy to me.
SPIKE: (lip still held) Hey. Easy with the lip.
GLORY: But if the Slayer protects him, maybe appearances are deceiving.
BUFFYBOT: I live here!
XANDER: If we're going to stop Spike from blabbing about Dawn, we're going to need these.
ANYA: Wow. The big guns. Only not guns. (then) Shouldn't we have guns?
BUFFYBOT: Those are my weapons. Give me something big and sharp.
WILLOW: Buffy? Where should we go? Where Should we look for Glory?
BUFFYBOT: She's a God! She wants the Key!
XANDER: Yeah. So we should look…?
BUFFYBOT: I don't know! Why are you all looking at me?
XANDER: Okay, Buff, it's okay. You're right.  You shouldn't have to know everything.
BUFFYBOT: We need to rescue Spike!
WILLOW: Um… Buffy? I think you have more weapons upstairs. You could go get those…
ANYA: And maybe change your clothes? You know, something more… fighty!
BUFFYBOT: I can do that! I'll be right back.
XANDER: Okay. This has gone way too far. She thinks we're going to <u>rescue</u> Spike!
WILLOW: Well, what <u>are</u> we going to do?
XANDER: Find him. Stop him from talking. Whatever it takes.
ANYA: And what do we do with Glory?
WILLOW: Whatever we do, we're going to need Buffy's help.
XANDER: Then we're gonna have to talk to her.
WILLOW: Intervention time again?
XANDER: Yeah. 'Cause what we need right now is a <u>sane</u> Buffy.
BUFFY: Whoa. Group play time.
WILLOW: That was quick.
BUFFY: Didn't seem like it to me. Death is my gift. Pffah!
XANDER: Buffy. We have to talk.
BUFFY: What happened? Is Dawn okay?
WILLOW: She's fine.
XANDER: Buffy, we care about you. And we're worried about you. The way you're acting, the things you're doing…
ANYA: It's wrong.
WILLOW: Wait. This shouldn't be about blame.
BUFFY: Blame? There's blame now?
WILLOW: No, there's only love. And some fear.
ANYA: We're just kinda thrown by the, you having sex with Spike.
BUFFY: The who whatting how with huh?
ANYA: Okay that's denial. That comes before anger.
BUFFY: I am not having sex with Spike!
ANYA: Anger.
XANDER: No one is judging you. It's  understandable. Spike is strong and mysterious and sort of compact but well-muscled-
BUFFY: I am not having sex with Spike, but I'm starting to think you are.
XANDER: Buffy. I saw you. Anya too. We saw you and Spike. With the straddling.
BUFFYBOT: Spike is mine! Who's straddling Spike?
BUFFY: Oh my God.
XANDER: And so say all of us.
BUFFYBOT: Say, look at you! You look like me! (confidentially) We're very pretty.
WILLOW: Two of them!
XANDER: Hey! I know this! They're <u>both</u> Buffy!
BUFFY: No. That's a robot. She acts just like that girlfriend-bot that Warren guy made! You couldn't tell me apart from a <u>robot</u>?!
BUFFYBOT: (mildly skeptical) Oh, I don't think I'm a robot.
ANYA: She's very well done.
BUFFY: (hurt) I get it. Fine. Robot. Fine.
XANDER: Spike must have had her built so he could program her to…
BUFFY: (genuine horror) Oh God.
WILLOW: Yikes. Imagine the things-
BUFFY: No! Stop imagining! All of you!
XANDER: (raising hand) Already got the visual.
BUFFYBOT: People! Friends of mine! You're forgetting the important thing! Glory has Spike and she's going to harm him!
BUFFY: Glory has Spike?
XANDER: We were gonna bring that up.
ANYA: We were getting weapons.
BUFFY: Grab 'em. We're going <u>now</u>. I have to kill him.
XANDER: We figured, any way we could stop him from talking…
BUFFY: No. I have to <u>kill</u> him.
WILLOW: But we don't even know where to look.
BUFFY: I know where to start.
GLORY: I have a riddle for you, Precious. How is a vampire that won't talk like an apple?
SPIKE: Enough. No more. I'll tell you who the soddin' Key is.
BUFFY: Okay, Glory's Key-sniffing snake was about here when I killed it, and it was headed back to her.
WILLOW: So you think she lives near here?
XANDER: That's not a lot to go on.
BUFFY: It's all we have.
GILES: Quite extraordinary, really.
BUFFYBOT: Thank you, but I think we should be listening to the other Buffy, (with a hard 'G') <u>G</u>iles. She's very smart and she's going to save Spike!
GILES: (hard 'G') "<u>G</u>iles"? Spike didn't even bother to program my name properly?!
BUFFY: Listen, skirt-girl, we're not going to "save" him, we're going to "kill" him. He knows who the Key is and there's no way he's not telling Glory.
BUFFYBOT: You're right. He's evil. Killing him is the only way. We're the Slayer and that's what we do. (then) But you should see him naked. I mean, really. Can we save him now, please?
BUFFY: (to the group) Split up, spread out. Check out the priciest-looking places first. Xander, come with me. Willow and Anya, go together. And- (pronounces it with a hard 'G') <u>G</u>iles, dyeh… (pronounces it right) Giles, you can watch… it.
GLORY: Good. Because I'm tired of these <u>games</u>!
SPIKE: Yeah, okay. The Key. Well, here's the thing…
SPIKE: It's that guy. On TV. What's his name?
GLORY: On the television?
SPIKE: On that show, the Price show, where they guess what stuff costs--
MURK: The Price is Right?
JINX: Bob Barker.
MURK: We will get Bob Barker! We will bring you the limp and beaten body of Bob Barker!
GLORY: It's not Bob Barker, you scabby morons! The Key is new to this world and Bob Barker is as old as grit.
SPIKE: Yeah, but it was fun. And guess what, bitch? I'm not telling you jack. You're never gonna get your sodding Key  because you might be strong, but in our world, you're an idiot-
GLORY: Stop it! I am a God.
SPIKE: The God of What? Bad home perms?
GLORY: Shut up! I command you shut up!
SPIKE: Yeah, okay. I mean, sorry, but I just had no idea Gods were such prancing lightweights.
SPIKE: Mark my words, the Slayer is going to kick your skanky lop-sided ass back to whatever place would take a cheap, whorish, fashion victim ex-God like you.
SPIKE: (in pain) Good plan, Spike. Fabulous bloody plan.
GLORY: Bring him back.
JINX: Here!
SPIKE: Oh, God.
MURK: You do not insult Glory by escaping!
GILES: Buffy! We're here!
BUFFYBOT: Spike! Spike's in there!
GILES: Buffy!
JINX: The Slayer was there!
MURK: A lethal fighter!
JINX: She seemed to be everywhere at once!
MURK: She had friends with many weapons!
JINX: They may have been demons.
GLORY: (calmly) And where is my vampire?
TARA: Is it weird?
BUFFY: Oh yeah. At least it's not a very good copy. I mean, look at it.
WILLOW: Uh… yeah.
BUFFY: (to Giles and Xander) What did you do with Spike? And please let the story have a dusty ending.
XANDER: We dumped him back in his crypt.
GILES: We tried to find out if he told her about… anything… He was too badly beaten to make any sense.
DAWN: But you found out something, right? Now you know where Glory lives.
BUFFY: We know where she <u>lived</u>. She's gotta be long gone by now. Did he tell Glory -
XANDER: We don't know. He was barely conscious.
ANYA: If he told her he'd just lie to us about it anyway, right?
BUFFY: Oh, you can count on that. But we gotta know. Now. If he did give us up, Dawn and I are gonna have to get out of town, or… I mean, she could be on her way.
GILES: (to Dawn) But there's no need to worry. I'm sure we're all perfectly safe.
DAWN: (sarcastic) We're safe. Right. And Spike built a robot Buffy to play <u>checkers</u> with.
TARA: It sounded convincing when I <u>thought</u> it…
WILLOW: Hey! I think I found something.
ANYA: Bleah. It's very complicated in there. Personally, I'd rather look at guts.
WILLOW: I found where she's broken. There's some wiring that got fried extra crispy. That's an easy fix - I mean, not that I would.
XANDER: God, I feel kinda bad for the guy. Gets all whupped, then his best toy gets taken away…
BUFFY: Xander, please don't be suggesting what I'd have to kill you for suggesting.
XANDER: No, no! Travesty! Completely on board. It's just… guy was so thrashed… just not his day.
BUFFY: Spike! You're covered in sexy wounds!
SPIKE: Yeah, they feel real sexy. Where ya been?
BUFFYBOT: I fell down and got confused but  Willow fixed me. She's gay! And then  I felt the pull of your sinister attraction.
SPIKE: Will fixed you? I'd a thought they'd melt you into scrap.
BUFFYBOT: They were confused, too. Do you want to ravage me?
SPIKE: Give us a minute. I got some bones need mending.
BUFFYBOT: Why did you let that Glory hurt you?
SPIKE: She wanted to know who the Key was.
BUFFYBOT: I can tell her! Then you won't -
SPIKE: No!
BUFFYBOT: Why?
SPIKE: Buffy - the other… the not-as-pleasant Buffy. Something happened to Dawn  it'd destroy her. I couldn't live, her being in that much pain. I'd let Glory kill me first. Nearly bloody did.
BUFFY: The robot is gone. The robot was gross and obscene.
SPIKE: It wasn't supposed to be -
BUFFY: Don't. That <u>thing</u>… it's not even real.
