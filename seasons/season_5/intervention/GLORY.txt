He's getting stronger. I'm losing him. I'm losing control of him.
He stabbed you! In your body! Oh, Jinxy, that's not on the dance card! That's not supposed to happen! He's a (distasteful) person. He's not supposed to do that.
And Jinx will stay all right until Ben finds out that he's not dead, that we know his secret. Then Ben will try to stop all of us!
We hurry. Scamper scamper. If time runs out on us and all we're left with  is info, then we're screwed.
No. We're screwed.
I'm a God in exile. Far from the Hellfires of Home and sharing my body with an enemy that stabs my boys in their fleshy little <u>stomachs</u>!
The Slayer and the Key are connected. She is going to have contact with it. Find out who is new in her life, who is special, who is different. Watch her.
She could give it a nickel on a street corner, or bump into it on a bus or share a creamy chocolate shake with it at the soda fountain. I want to hear about everyone she has contact with. That girl has my Key and I'm trusting you boys to get it for me. If you love me, get it for me.
What the Hell is that and why is its hair that color?
(fake glee) Really? That's fantabulous! And impossible! (then) He can't be the Key. Because, see, the Key has to be pure. This is a Vampire. Lesson number one,  <u>Vampires equal impure</u>!
(to Jinx) Can't even brain-suck a vampire.  He's completely useless.
Really? Precious?
He doesn't look very fancy to me.
But if the Slayer protects him, maybe appearances are deceiving.
I have a riddle for you, Precious. How is a vampire that won't talk like an apple?
Good. Because I'm tired of these <u>games</u>!
On the television?
It's not Bob Barker, you scabby morons! The Key is new to this world and Bob Barker is as old as grit.
Stop it! I am a God.
Shut up! I command you shut up!
Bring him back.
(calmly) And where is my vampire?
