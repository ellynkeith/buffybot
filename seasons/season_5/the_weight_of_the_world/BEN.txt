... Can't kill the girl...!
Dawn. Has Glory hurt you?
Where is it?
All the blood. I can feel it, still warm  and wet and... Glory. Oh, God.  She slaughtered hundreds of men.  I can feel them breaking.
(calming down) I'm remembering her, aren't I? The things she's done. Things she's going to do.
How can she do this?
No, I mean, I have a job. I have a life.  And Glory? She never once thinks of  me in all this.
How?
I'll take you as far as I can. Ditch you before she comes back.
Don't look back. Stay close to me.
Shh. Stay very still.
I said leave her alone!
Do you ever stop talking? I don't know  which is worse, waking up in a dress  not knowing where I've been, or  having to hear all your self-involved ranting.
Wrong, Glory. I'm no animal. This  is humanity you're feeling. Welcome  to the world.
I won't let you hurt her, Glory.
You really think I'll just let that happen?
You need her blood?
You can't. You're immortal.
Do you really believe, with all I know, that you can trick me?
And I disappear.
I won't make a deal with you, Glory.
I believe you. That's not the problem.  You make me immortal, then what? (grabbing Dawn) I have to kill her to do it and I won't  be able live with that! Not even for a  day - forget about eternity.
I can't accept that.
I'm sorry.
Don't make this harder than it already is.  I'm sorry, I got no choice. It's you or me.
