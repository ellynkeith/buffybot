I want to go home.
No.
Please. Stop.
Yes.
Don't.
Don't - call - me - "Dawnie."
I'm sorry.
Guilty?
I'm not doing anything, I swear.
Ben?
Yes.
(suspicious) Do what?
It depends on the person.
Some.
Buffy.
No. Not yet. But I have to get out of here. Ben?
Where's what?
Ben. Something is happening. To both you <i>and</i> Glory.
I know. She told me. I think whatever  the magic is that keeps you guys apart,  it's starting to break down. Ben.  Glory could come back any minute.
I don't know. But we have to get out  of here and find Buffy before ...
Help me.
Please.
I'm sorry.
Wh-what are you doing?
