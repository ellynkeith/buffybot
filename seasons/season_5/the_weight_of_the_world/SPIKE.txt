Better part of a century spent in delinquency just paid off. (beat) Hot-wired Ben's auto. Who's for getting the hell out of here?
The Slayer'll be all right. Won't she?
Buffy! She can't just be brain dead.  I mean - she's still Buffy. Somewhere,  in there. Right?
You're not getting Dawn back any  way you slice it, Harris. That's for  Buffy to handle.
You don't need a diploma to see that. Snap her out of it. Buffy?
Come on, people, the girl's endowed  with Slayer strength. Hardly the time  to get dainty. BUFFY!
We've got to do something! I can't  just sit here watching. You waste  time with kid gloves. I'm willing to  gamble when all's said and done -  Buffy likes it rough.
Do that again, I'll have a piece of you.
Uh, Will? Now, uh, don't turn me  into a horned toad for asking, but -  what if we come across Ben?
Well, yeah. Specially not one who also happens to be Glory.
<u>You</u> know... Ben is Glory.
No no. Ben is Glory. Glory's Ben. They're one and the same.
Not one hour ago! Right here, before  your very eyes! Ben came, turned into  Glory, snatched the kid, and - phht! -  vanished. Remember?
Ah! I get it. <i>Very</i> crafty. Glory's  worked the kind of mojo where  anyone who sees her little presto- chango instantly forgets. And yours  truly, being somewhat other than  human, stands immune.
And a kewpie doll for the lady.
(sighing) Might be best, I explain on the way ...
Checked out Glory's flat - looks like the Great One has scampered.
Not entirely.
This - is gonna be worth it.
Ow!
Ow!
Last time, from the top ...
Thanks awfully, no. We need information. We need ...
(to Xander) Look at this. Special Ed remembers.
Wonderful. But not why we're here. (to Doc) Hellgod type, name of Glory ...
... is gone missing. Brewing up some  major league bad. And she's nicked  the Slayer's kid sister in the bargain.
Yeah, yeah. Got any idea where Glory would take her?
Love to. Can't.
She's got Dawn.
How the hell we supposed to get to China? Teleport?
You're lying.
Aaahh!!
Something worth dying for.
