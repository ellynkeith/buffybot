All in favor, let's do it. (to Giles) You good to go?
Same. Still.
Try again, Will.
Try.
Spike, come on. We're not getting Dawn back by sitting around here.
Good. Panic. That ought to help.
I am so large with not knowing.
We tried that.
Are you insane!? We could be  dealing with neurological damage  here. You want to kill her?
I said stop!
"With" in what sense?
(deliberate) So you're saying... Ben, and Glory ...
Glory can turn into Ben, and Ben turns back into Glory.
How you doing?
Willow's on it. Or, in it. She's  working some spell, trying to reach  Buffy psychically.
Pretty trippy stuff.
The mental ward? Already been.  Vegetable section's closed. Nobody  there. It's like they all just got up  and walked away.
Wait - Ben? At Glory's? So you're  saying that all this time he was  sub-letting from her?
Ow!
(blurts) Ben is Glory!
Yeah. I do. Ben's Glory. Glory, Ben. It's like a fog is lifting.
A.K.A. <i>Ben</i> ...
(re: box) What do we got?
Did you know Ben is Glory?
