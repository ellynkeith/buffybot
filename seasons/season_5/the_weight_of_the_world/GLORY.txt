Hey! Minions. I can <i>hear</i> you.  God-like ears - don't miss much,  know what I'm saying?
Guys - I'm not gonna kill you. Not in the mood. (beat) What do you think that's about?
No, brainless. In torture, death and chaos does my power lie. So tell me. Why am I not popping your head like a zit right now?
Nah, I'm not hungry.
To the Hell I came from. Where I'm  gonna rain down more supersized  portions of slaughter, mayhem, and  bloodshed than you scabs can even  dream about.
Unbelievable, how annoying the Groupies can be.
What's he doing?
Really don't. Go.
Get out get out GET OUT!!!
Tch. You know, you recapture  your Godhood and unleash Armageddon?  All of a sudden everybody wants to  be part of the inner circle. You okay?
Sweetie, you're about to.
Pillow? I don't know if this thing  gets cable. Doubtful...
You're nervous.
I know how you feel. It's your  last night. As, you know, a human.  This body?
(confused) What?
(genuine, child-like) Wow. You know ... that actually hurt my feelings.
Not the point. (piecing it together) I'm just thinking, here I'm trying  to make you feel better when: comforting others - not part of my  life. And I'm doing it so that I'll  stop feeling so, um ... help me out.
Guilty!
We'll see.
I'm hating this, Murk.
Memories. I'm starting to remember  the things Ben did. People he spoke  with, stuff he wore... (shudders) Kid.
Yeah. Ben. You... (remembering) You called him. To the desert, when  you were hiding from me. And he  came. And then, he was me. You  remember?
See?!? She's not supposed to remember  that! <i>Nobody</i> should. The cloak between  Ben and me is fading. I almost helped her!  He, I wanted to ...
Ben! The human meatsack who's  infecting me. Do your mojo, make a surgical ... (hunts for the word)  Incision or removal or whatever it is  you gotta do! Help me! I'm thinking  Ben's thoughts and feeling his feelings  and - IIII...
Damn it!
Gods don't pay.
All right, you're right, it's cool. I'm  just a little emotional right now.  Which, if you're into irony: funny. (to Minions) Leave. We need a little girl time.
(duh) People. How do they function? Here.  Like this, in the world, with all this  <i>bile</i> running through them. Every day, it's ...
So, you're saying some people like this?
Funny, 'cause I look around at this  world you're so eager to be a part of,  and all I see's six billion lunatics  looking for the fastest ride out.  Who's not crazy? Look around -  everyone's drinkin', smokin', shootin' up, shootin' each other or just plain  screwing their brains out because they  don't want 'em anymore. I'm crazy?  Honey, I am the original one-eyed  chicklet in the kingdom of the blind  'cause at least I admit the world makes  me nuts. Name one person who can  take it here. That's all I'm asking - Name one.
Ohh, Ben! This is really - not a  good time... nNNNOO!!
"Sorry?" That actually hurt, you pre-pubescent puke.
Okay, first thought, just totally  spontaneous, unfiltered, off the top of my head?
No. NO! Little late in the game to  start growing a backbone, Benjamin.  Now be good and stay quiet.
Animal...
No no no.
Shut your hole, you sanctimonious little  meatworm. I'm going home no matter  what you do.
Benjamin. What are you doing?
You can't hurt her and you know it,  Ben. I know it, because I feel what  you're feeling. Scared?
Nobody has to die here, Ben. Just  let me bleed the girl and go home.  Everything'll work out fine.
Stop and think, baby. We bleed the  kid. Return me to my seat of power.  I become a God again.
Unless somebody up there likes you.  Give up the girl, and I could like you a lot.
(sighs) When exactly did you get stupid? I'm offering immortality here!
Baby, baby, baby Ben... why do you  worry so much? When you're immortal,  all this crap you've been carrying around  inside - the guilt, the anger, the crazy-making  pain ... it all just melts away, like ice  cream. Trust me. When all this is over,  I can set you up real nice. I'm making  it easy. It's you - or the girl.
Accept it. (smiles) I'm a God, stupid.
