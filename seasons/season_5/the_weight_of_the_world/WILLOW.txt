It's been almost half an hour.
Okay, but I'm not sure if she's, you know, really in there.
Buffy? Can you hear me? Buffy?
We should move her. Unless we shouldn't. Should we?
<i>Separate</i>.
I'll help Buffy.
Nothing, I don't think a doctor's what Buffy needs right now.
You mean Ben's with Glory?
So, Ben and Glory are... the same person?
I think so. I don't know. It's not  exactly well-explored territory, but ...  I've got to try.
Shh, it's okay. I'm here. (to Anya) Will you watch after her while I'm ...
Mostly? Just be here for her. There's  some pills in my knapsack. Half of  one every two hours keeps her pretty  mellow.
(shrugs) Wish me luck.
Hello, Buffy.
Actually, I'm, um - looking for you.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
But, you know we need you. You have to come out.
To be with your friends.
(to herself) Dawn ...
O-kayâ€¦
Hey. I know you. You're that first  original Slayer who tried killing us  all in our dreams. (lame) How've you been?
Wait. Death is her what?
Where you going?
I can't keep following you around like  this, Buffy. We have to go. You have  to talk to ...
... Me.
Yeah, I keep hearing that, but I'm not sure what it means.
Not to you, maybe ...
Buffy, stop. No, God, no. Stop!
Actually, I'm, um - looking for you.  Here. Again.
No. And I think we already deja'd this vu.
Yes, as you'll tell me again when we're  older, and in chem class. Buffy, what  are we doing here?
We don't have time.
You have to stop doing this.
Killing Dawn.
Because it never happened. You never killed your sister!
In your imagination! None of this is  real, you're stuck in some kind of loop.
Why are you doing this?!?
No. Buffy. Leave Dawn alone. What is this?
But I'm not talking about this, I'm talking about ...
... This.
I'm not! You're the one who keeps  dragging me back here. And you  wouldn't be doing that if you weren't  trying to show me something.
Buffy, c'mon. It's your brain. Just tell me.
You did?
What hit you?
You can't know that.
Why?
Is that what you think?
I think Spike was right, back at the gas station. (sudden, sharp) Snap out of it!
I'm sorry. But all this - it has a name.  It's called guilt. It's a feeling, and it's  important, but it's not more than that,  Buffy. <i>Buffys</i>. You've carried the  weight of the world on your shoulders  since high school. I know you didn't  ask for this. But you do it. Every day,  and so you wanted out for one second,  so what?
Hello! Your sister - not dead yet!  But she will be if you stay locked  inside here and never come back to us.
Okay, unlike Glory, the Slayer is also  human. You get to be. You feel  everything you're doing and I admit,  I have no idea how hard that must be -  but you have to do it.
Then I guess you're right. And you did kill your sister.
Where you're needed.
