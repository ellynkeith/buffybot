Morning, guys. Ooh, check out the "pamper Mom" platter. You two do all this?
I'm sure you did. (sitting) And neither one of you's pregnant, failing, or under indictment? Just checking.
(nods) The headache they said would go away came back. And brought some friends along with.
Take four of... whatever these are a day, come back for tests.
Not yet.
We need a first opinion first, honey.
Buffy, I know you're concerned, but don't be. I'm still the Mom, which means I get to worry about you two. And it's a good thing, because you're a vampire slayer and you... (squeezing Dawn) ...you're my little punkin' belly.
So? I can't be retro?
(lovingly) No, I think you were always just... Buffy.
Wait - what are you two hanging around here for? isn't this Mr. Giles' big day?
So, go! Bring me back a, I don't know, flying broomstick or something.
Whatever. Book club tonight?
It's my head...
No, sweetheart, I'm fine.
I just need my prescription. Please.
You all right? You look...
Either modern medicine's working, or I just took the world's best placebos. Either way, I'm heading out for a couple of hours.
Hmm?
Are you sure you're feeling okay? You seem a little... out of it.
Hey. Buffy?
So grown up.
Buffy?
Girls?
Where is every...
Oh!
Dawn. I must be getting jumpy in my old age. Where's Buffy?
Probably right. It's not like she's never patrolled before. Anyway, I was feeling kind of... what's the medical term? "Crappy." So I called off the big night out.
Um...
You're home.
What's that all about?
