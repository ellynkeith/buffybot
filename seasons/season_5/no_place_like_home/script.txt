MONK: (Czech with subtitles) Uz se to blízí. Zabije nás to! (translation) It's coming. It's going to kill us!
MONK: (Czech with subtitles) Na nasich Zivotech nezálezí. Musíme chránit klíc. (translation) Our lives aren't important. We have to protect The Key.
MONK: (Czech with subtitles) Pomoz mi s obradem. (translation) Help me perform the ritual.
MONK: (Czech with subtitles) Soustred' se. (translation) Concentrate.
VAMP: I've always wanted to kill the Slayer.
BUFFY: And I've always wanted piano lessons. So really, who's surprised we have all this unexpressed rage?
BUFFY: But honestly? I think I'm expressing mine better. Tell you what:
BUFFY: You go find yourself a good anger management class...
BUFFY: And I'll jam this pokey wood stick through your heart.
BUFFY: Think that sets the world speed record for closure.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: If you're looking for one of those rave parties, you're late. Chased a bunch of kids outta here last night.
BUFFY: Oh. Yeah, darn, and my fellow ravers will be so disappointed. (confidential) My turn to bring bundt cake.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: If it was my call, I'd let you do what you want. Not like anybody's using the place. But, they don't pay us enough to argue with the boss, so...
BUFFY: I'm already gone.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: Hold it!
NIGHTWATCHMAN: Take your... whatever this is with you.
BUFFY: Right. Thanks.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: Glow balls. (laughs) I just don't get your generation. I mean, what is that thing?
BUFFY: I'll let you know when I find out.
BUFFY: Dawn! Touch nothing.
DAWN: Jahvol, mein sibling. Who died and made you the Iron Chef?
BUFFY: Look: Mom's sick, I made her a nice, non-instant breakfast for once, and I don't want you...
DAWN: Oops.
BUFFY: ...doing that.
JOYCE: Morning, guys. Ooh, check out the "pamper Mom" platter. You two do all this?
DAWN: Buffy helped.
BUFFY: I didn't "help."
JOYCE: I'm sure you did. (sitting) And neither one of you's pregnant, failing, or under indictment? Just checking.
BUFFY: We just knew you were feeling less than great, so...
JOYCE: (nods) The headache they said would go away came back. And brought some friends along with.
BUFFY: What'd your doctors say?
JOYCE: Take four of... whatever these are a day, come back for tests.
BUFFY: So they don't know what's wrong.
JOYCE: Not yet.
BUFFY: That's unacceptable. We need a second opinion.
JOYCE: We need a first opinion first, honey.
BUFFY: Okay. Let's go now.
JOYCE: Buffy, I know you're concerned, but don't be. I'm still the Mom, which means I get to worry about you two. And it's a good thing, because you're a vampire slayer and you... (squeezing Dawn) ...you're my little punkin' belly.
DAWN: Mom! That's like, my kid name.
JOYCE: So? I can't be retro?
DAWN: I'm fourteen. Nicknames like "little pumpkin belly" tend to flatline growing self-esteem.
BUFFY: (to Joyce) You ever have names for me?
JOYCE: (lovingly) No, I think you were always just... Buffy.
DAWN: I got some names for you...
JOYCE: Wait - what are you two hanging around here for? isn't this Mr. Giles' big day?
BUFFY: Bigger than big. It's his "Grand Opening" day.
JOYCE: So, go! Bring me back a, I don't know, flying broomstick or something.
DAWN: Those never really work.
JOYCE: Whatever. Book club tonight?
BUFFY: You guys have a book club?
DAWN: We're reading a heartbreaking work of staggering genius.
BUFFY: I'm in. What's it called?
DAWN: (duh) "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius."
BUFFY: I'll be back later. Your doctor's appointment's for when?
BUFFY: I just want to know! Take it easy. Feet up, plenty of Oprah.
DAWN: Plus you can check my rain forest report and you know there's like eighty badillion old board games in the... hey!
DAWN: You said I couldn't come.
BUFFY: Changed my mind.
DAWN: (to Buffy) Told you you couldn't ditch me. (looking around) Whoa, Mr. Giles, this place is so, wow, I mean... check out all the magic junk!
GILES: Our new slogan.
DAWN: When's it open? You know, for customers.
GILES: Since nine this morning, actually.
BUFFY: (angry, to Dawn) Go. Browse. And...
DAWN: "You break it, you bought it." I heard you the first sixty times.
GILES: Not to worry. I have a very good feeling about this place. Magic's a small niche market, but think about it: Sunnydale. Monsters. Supply. Demand. Be lines around the block in no time.
BUFFY: (distracted) Oh yeah. Money, hand over fist.
BUFFY: Which, I guess is a good thing.
GILES: Buffy, are you all right? You seem distracted.
BUFFY: Slayer-wise, I'm tip-top. But Mom's still sick, and we don't know what the deal is.
GILES: She is getting medical attention?
BUFFY: Oh yeah. Got a whole, highly trained medical staff working round the clock to tell us diddly.
GILES: I'm sorry. But time and patience can both be great comforts in...
WILLOW: Giles! Where's your hat and cloak?
RILEY: The hype was out of control.
DAWN: Willow! You gotta see this, they have the coolest talismen. Mans. Talis-guys...
BUFFY: Actually, I've got a little scooby- centric deal to deal with first.
BUFFY: I put it before the group... What the hell is this?
GILES: Appears to be paranormal in origin.
WILLOW: How can you tell?
GILES: Well, it's so shiny.
BUFFY: Found it on patrol.
RILEY: May be more where that came from. I say we go back out again tonight.
BUFFY: Uh... sure.
DAWN: (to Riley) You can't patrol. Buffy said.
BUFFY: No I didn't.
DAWN: Yeah, remember? It'd be easier if you didn't have to look out for anybody...?
BUFFY: (covering) Yeah, but I wasn't talking about...
RILEY: Don't worry about it.
DAWN: (to Riley) She just said you look even cuter when you're all weak and kitteny, and she better go solo or you'd get hurt. So welcome to the club, she'll never let me go either...
DAWN: What? What? What?
RILEY: Giles, you got that danger room set up out back? I'm feeling the need for a little physical re-hab about now.
GILES: Of course. This way. (to Buffy) If any customers do show up...
WILLOW: On it.
BUFFY: (to Dawn) We're going.
WILLOW: Buffy, wait. Go easy on her.
BUFFY: Why?
WILLOW: I can't help it. I have all this involuntary empathy for Dawn, 'cause she's, you know, a big spaz.
BUFFY: Yeah but she's so annoying, especially now Mom's sick and Dawn's all over her, while I have to be the grown-up, and they're like the giggle twins and how come I never get to be the Little Pumpkin Belly?
WILLOW: While I don't feel qualified to address that last part, I can tell you, Dawn's not just the youngest. She's the baby. Maybe your Mom needs that now.
BUFFY: Like Dawn even cares what -- You have no idea how much I wish I were an only child these days.
DAWN: ...can't all be born with big fancy Chosen One reflexes, you know.
BUFFY: Shh. Mom?
BUFFY: Mom!
DAWN: What's wrong?
JOYCE: It's my head...
BUFFY: Come on. I'm taking you to the doctors.
JOYCE: No, sweetheart, I'm fine.
BUFFY: No! You don't know that! We don't know anything. Come on.
JOYCE: I just need my prescription. Please.
BUFFY: Hospital pharmacy open?
BUFFY: Ten minutes.
BEN: Hey. It's um, Buffy, isn't it?
BUFFY: (no clue) Um...?
BEN: Ben. But you can just call me "Man-Nurse" like everyone - whoa!
PATIENT: I don't belong here! I have important instructions! Fascists!
BEN: (to patient) Okay, now you're hurting the nice intern who's here to help you. (to intern) Could we get a doctor here? We need nine ccs of phenobarbital in this guy now.
BEN: Or not. Let's strap him. (to patient) For your own good, promise. (to Buffy) Not to be rampantly sexist in the workplace but, you've got some serious mus-kles for a girl.
BUFFY: Oh. Um...
BEN: Radioactive spider bite?
BUFFY: How'd you guess?
BEN: I'm a doctor. Well, almost.
BUFFY: HEY!
PATIENT: Doesn't even help, doesn't make a damn bit of difference.
BUFFY: I've met this guy. He's not crazy.
BEN: If you say so...
NIGHTWATCHMAN: They're coming at you. Don't think you're above it, missy! They come through the family... They get to... your family...
BUFFY: (stunned) What do you mean?
BEN: Let's get him in exam one. Now would be nice.
BEN: Sorry about that. Here.
BEN: For your Mom?
BUFFY: Huh? Oh. Yeah.
BEN: She's not feeling better?
BUFFY: Not yet. She will be.
BUFFY: I'm starting to figure out what's wrong.
GLORY: There you are! I...
GLORY: ...Have been looking all over for you!
GILES: (smiling) Thank you for choosing to shop at The Magic Box. And please, do come again.
GILES: Did you see? Customers! Real live customers! They came in, and I gave them things, and they gave me money and then they left! It's brilliant!
WILLOW: Congratulations, you're now an official capitalist running dog. But I gotta tell you - on the Orbular front? (closes book) We're kind of batting zero.
GILES: We'll just have to keep at it, then. (to customers) If there's anything you need help with, just let me know.
ANYA: Your conjuring powder's grotesquely overpriced.
GILES: Anya...
ANYA: I'm sorry. But I'm nearly out of money. I've never had to "afford" things before and it's making me bitter.
GILES: And the change is palpable. That stuff doesn't come cheap.
ANYA: Well you're getting ripped off. I can hook you up direct with the troll that sheds it...
BUFFY: Giles. I have an idea what's making my mom sick.
GILES: You've spoken with her doctors?
BUFFY: They won't find anything. What's hurting her: it's supernatural.
BUFFY: The Nightwatchman who found this thing went crazy. Like, overnight. Something made him that way.
WILLOW: Let's not taunt the Happy Fun Ball.
BUFFY: This won't hurt us, I had it on me all night. But this guy. Giles, he saw things. Said things.
GILES: Such as...?
BUFFY: They'll come at me through my family.
GILES: Who will?
BUFFY: I don't know. Yet. But whatever touched this guy made him see through what the rest of us are seeing. He knew. Someone's hurting my mom, and they're trying to get to me.
GILES: It's possible, but still. A madman's ramblings are not much to go on.
BUFFY: It's a start. We have to find out who's making my mom sick, and how.
WILLOW: Then what?
BUFFY: I hunt them. Find them. And kill them.
GLORY: And feel free to tell me if this next part gets too personal, I'm told I have boundary issues, but I am hurt - YES - by your incredibly selfish behavior. Newsflash, hairdo: It's not always about you.
GLORY: All I want is THE KEY!!!
GLORY: Why won't you tell me where The Key is?
GLORY: Forgive me, monky. I just get so, ohh, anxious sometimes like there's mmm, something deep inside me and it's swelling up and making me crazy and I just forget there's all this, nnngh, DUCT TAPE on your face...
GLORY: Now tell me where The Key is...
GLORY: ...or I'm going bowling.
MONK: (Czech) Z... Z...
GLORY: It's okay. The stutter is sexy, keep it coming.
MONK: (Czech with subtitles) Z-zab-bij... zab-bij me. (translation) K-kill... kill me.
GLORY: (Czech with subtitles) Jsme v novém svete, tak proboha... (translation) We're in the new world now, so please, for God's sake... (English, no subtitles) SPEAK AMERICAN!!!
MONK: (accented english) I... I will tell you... (spits) Nothing.
GLORY: Fine. Know what I wish?
GLORY: I wish that you could feel what I'm feeling right now.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: Lady, whatever you are. Whatever, you're on. Please...
GLORY: (to Monk) 'Cause I don't know how much more of this I can take.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: I have a wife. Her name is Jennifer. We have two daughters...
GLORY: (to Monk) I'll bet this is fun for you! Isn't it? Say it, you like to torture me! Why? You don't even own the damn thing and I want it I need it I have got to have it NOW and you keep refusing to tell me WHERE THE KEY IS and...
GLORY: And it's typical, like the big mortal meatsack comes complete with stink and bile sweat and protein yes I said HUMANS - Not now Mommy's TALKING - Wriggling, piling, plowing, crawling, clowning, cavorting, DOING IT over and over and over and over 'til somebody's gotta sit down on their tuffet and make this birthing STOP.
GLORY: Oh. Oh, that's much better.
CUSTOMER: Do you giftwrap?
WILLOW: (eager) Do we! (to Anya) Do we ? (to customer) We do. (to Anya) Little help...
GILES: No, it's the ground cloven hooves that are thirty percent off - whole hooves, full price.
GILES: That's um, not candy... (to Xander) Xander. There's, there's too many of them. People. And they all seem to want things.
XANDER: I hear you. Stay British, you'll be okay.
XANDER: The thousand-yard stare. Damn. You hate to see it on any man, but especially in retail.
ANYA: Please go.
XANDER: Anya, the Shopkeepers Union of America called? They want me to tell you "please go" just got replaced with "have a nice day."
ANYA: I have their money. Who cares what kind of day they have?
XANDER: No one. It's a long cultural tradition of raging insincerity. Embrace it.
ANYA: (deadpan) Hey! You! Have a nice day.
XANDER: There's my girl.
XANDER: You ever thought in a million years you'd miss the high school library?
BUFFY: Someone put a spell on my Mom. Something to make her look like she's sick.
XANDER: That's a new kind of nasty. Any suspects?
BUFFY: Got the list narrowed down to just under infinity.
WILLOW: Does this look right to you?
ANYA: Sure, if you wrapped it with your feet. You know Buffy, there used to be this French sorcerer, back in the sixteen-I-don't-know- what's, named...
GILES: Cloutier?
ANYA: (nods) So cute in his little knickers but he had this one spell demons just hated, called "Tirer la Couture."
BUFFY: "Rotate many foodstuffs?"
WILLOW: "Pull the curtain back."
ANYA: A spell to see spells. Well, a trance to see spells, but, you get the idea. Try that.
BUFFY: What do you mean, "see spells?"
GILES: All spells leave some trace signature, they're just not perceptible to the human eye. In this case, it could be the image of a hand choking your mother.
ANYA: A cloud of mist around her...
WILLOW: Or maybe the shape of the demon who's performing the spell?
GILES: Possibly. You'll have to take a mental picture. Cameras won't see or capture the image.
ANYA: And that's thirty-two even.
BUFFY: Okay. So I'll just do what the Monsieur Silk Knickers did. Go home, get trancey, see what's affecting my Mom.
XANDER: (re: Anya) Ladies and gentleman, put your hands together for Scooby of the Month here.
WILLOW: I don't know. Trances...
GILES: Yes. Buffy, The sorcerer Cloutier was legendary. His skills at achieving higher states of consciousness were...
BUFFY: Better than mine? I knew you'd say that, but we've been practicing concentration drills. I know I'm close.
GILES: But are you ready?
BUFFY: It's my mom. I'll get ready. (to Anya) What do I need?
BUFFY: Thanks again for coming. I totally appreciate the help.
RILEY: Sure thing. So, what do I do?
BUFFY: Lots. Tons. Lots and lots of tons. This is all kind of, uh...
RILEY: ...new terrain?
BUFFY: (nods) All prayin', no slayin'. So, let's see... the incense needs to be "ignited," and that's a job, then this stuff gets poured round me counter-clockwise, and um, ...
RILEY: So you need me to light incense and pour sand?
BUFFY: Magic incense and spooky sand. And, the ritual itself is...
RILEY: Something you do alone.
RILEY: You sure this isn't just your way of trying to make me feel less... what's the words? Cute and weak and kittenish?
BUFFY: Kitten<i>ny</i>.
RILEY: Right. Much manlier. Look:
RILEY: I really am okay.
BUFFY: I know...
RILEY: So I'm not quite super-guy anymore. That was borrowed power anyway, I had to give it back sometime.
BUFFY: I know you can handle yourself. I just didn't want to see you get hurt.
RILEY: Maybe instead of you trying to take care of me, we agree to try taking care of each other. Deal?
BUFFY: Done.
RILEY: Good.
RILEY: For luck.
BUFFY: A girl needs more luck than that.
RILEY: Have a nice trip.
BUFFY: My boyfriend! Now go away!
BUFFY: No I'm not.
BUFFY: No you can't.
BUFFY: No!
BUFFY: Go, go tell, go wherever you want...
BUFFY: Mom.
JOYCE: You all right? You look...
BUFFY: Going out?
JOYCE: Either modern medicine's working, or I just took the world's best placebos. Either way, I'm heading out for a couple of hours.
BUFFY: Nothing...
JOYCE: Hmm?
BUFFY: There's nothing.
JOYCE: Are you sure you're feeling okay? You seem a little... out of it.
JOYCE: Hey. Buffy?
BUFFY: Huh? Oh. Yeah. I mean, I'm fine. Long day's all. You, um, have a good time.
JOYCE: So grown up.
DAWN: Buffy! Who said you could come in my room?!?
BUFFY: <b>You're not my sister</b>.
DAWN: Tch'yeah! Like I even want to be related to your smelly... Ow! What are you doing?
BUFFY: What are you?
DAWN: Get off me!
BUFFY: You want to hurt me?
DAWN: Let me go, you freak!
BUFFY: Then you deal with me.
DAWN: I'm telling Mom!
BUFFY: You - stay away from my mother.
BUFFY: What.
GILES: Buffy - I'm glad I caught you... I think we may have underestimated what we're dealing with.
BUFFY: Go on.
GILES: We've uncovered more than expected...
GILES: ...about this Orb. It's called The Dagon's Sphere, and has a history that goes back many centuries.
GILES: It's a protective device. Used to ward off ancient, primordial evil.
BUFFY: Any word what this evil looks like?
GILES: This is where accounts get vague. All we've pinned down is that The Dagon's Sphere was created to repel...
GILES: (reading) "...that which cannot be named."
BUFFY: I'm going down to the factory where I found it. Whoever planted this doohickey's got answers.
GILES: Anything that goes unnamed is usually an object of deep worship, or great fear. Maybe both. You could face a level of raw power you've never known before. Have you...
BUFFY: That's the thing. I just saw...
BUFFY: Nothing. Didn't work.
GILES: Hello? Hel-lo?
DAWN: What are you talking about?
BUFFY: Slayer stuff.
BUFFY: I'm going out.
DAWN: Do you really think I care you're the Slayer?
BUFFY: What's that supposed to mean?
BUFFY: I'll be home in an hour.
DAWN: Mom's coming back.
BUFFY: I'll be back first.
BUFFY: Spike!
SPIKE: (a little dopey) Hi, Buffy.
BUFFY: Look, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but...
BUFFY: What are you doing here?
BUFFY: Five words or less.
SPIKE: Out. For. A. Walk. (then) Bitch.
BUFFY: Outside my house. At night. (sighs) No one has time for this, <i>William</i>.
SPIKE: On your merry way, then. Contrary to one self-involved world view, your house happens to be directly between... parts and other... parts of this town. And I would pass by in the day, but I feel I'm outgrowing my whole burst-into- flame phase.
BUFFY: Fine. Keep going, I cut you a break.
SPIKE: Yeah, okay, let me guess: "you won't kill me... Ooh, the crowd pleasing threats &amp; swagger routine - how stunningly original. I'm just passing through. Satisfied? I really do hope so because God knows you need some satisfaction in life besides shagging Captain Cardboard and I never really liked you anyway and, and, and your hair looks very stupid.
BUFFY: (to herself) Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in...
BUFFY: ...Not by the hairs of my chinny chin chin...
BUFFY: ...then I'll huff, and I'll puff...
JOYCE: Buffy?
JOYCE: Girls?
JOYCE: Where is every...
DAWN: Hi, Mom.
JOYCE: Oh!
JOYCE: Dawn. I must be getting jumpy in my old age. Where's Buffy?
DAWN: You don't have to worry about her.
JOYCE: Probably right. It's not like she's never patrolled before. Anyway, I was feeling kind of... what's the medical term? "Crappy." So I called off the big night out.
DAWN: Want tea, Mom?
JOYCE: Um...
DAWN: I made it for you.
BUFFY: Whoa.
BUFFY: Hey. It was you, planted the thing, the... Dagon's Sphere, right? I have it. We're not alone, I've got friends who can help you. Don't worry.
BUFFY: I'm stronger than I look.
BUFFY: I've got some experience with stuff like this.
BUFFY: And best of all...
BUFFY: I'm not stupid.
GLORY: You sure about that last part?
GILES: (weary) Would someone please rip that bloody bell off its hinges?
XANDER: Would that involve moving?
WILLOW: My feet are numb.
XANDER: I'll see your numbness, and raise you a lower back pain.
GILES: I think I liked it better when demons would crash in and tear the place apart. It just seemed so much simpler.
ANYA: You're out of crystal balls. Those babies are really popular with the amateurs. Better re- stock and raise the price ten percent. Make it fifteen.
GILES: Anya...
ANYA: Your receipt drawer looks like squirrels nest in it...
GILES: Anya...
ANYA: And the Hand of Glory packs some serious dark power. You'd better institute a seven day background check for...
GILES: (exploding) Anya!
GILES: Would you like a job?
ANYA: Okay.
GILES: Good. Then let's talk shop tomorrow.
ANYA: Okay... (a little giddy) ..."Boss."
XANDER: Way to go, Anya. That's very empowering. Dinner's on you.
WILLOW: Hey, any word from Buffy on how her spell went?
GILES: She said it didn't work. And now she's off investigating who left The Dagon's Sphere behind.
XANDER: You're not worried about the Slay- Master General, are you big G?
GILES: No, no, I just hope she isn't doing anything too rash.
GLORY: ...And another thing. I just want you to know...
GLORY: That this whole "beat you to death" thing I'm doing...
GLORY: It's valuable time out of life that I am never getting back.
GLORY: Wait, I've always wanted to try this.
GLORY: You know, the thing with worms where, you rip 'em in half, you get two worms? Think that'll work with you?
GLORY: You - HIT ME!
GLORY: Ow! What are you, crazy?
GLORY: You can't go around hitting people, what were you, raised in a barn? There's such a thing as manners, you know and while we're on the subject, I just gotta ask, Blabberina, do you EVER shut up?
GLORY: Fine - be that way.
GLORY: Hey I just noticed something. You have superpowers! That is so cool! Can you fly?
GLORY: Hey.
GLORY: HEY!!! Hands off my holy man!
GLORY: Mmph!
GLORY: Aw, sh...
MONK: Stop. Please...
BUFFY: We gotta keep moving.
MONK: My journey's done, I think.
BUFFY: (tough soldier) Don't get metaphory on me. We're going.
MONK: You have to... The Key. You must protect The Key.
BUFFY: Protect the Key. Right. I know, we'll do it together! Far, far from here.
MONK: Many have... died... many more, if you don't... keep it safe...
BUFFY: How? What is it?
MONK: The Key is energy. It's a portal. It opens the door...
BUFFY: That round glowy thing?
MONK: (shakes his head) For centuries it had no form at all. My brethren... its only keepers. Then...
MONK: The abomination... found us. We had to hide The Key... Gave it form. Molded it flesh, made it human. And sent it to you.
BUFFY: Dawn.
MONK: (nods) She is The Key.
BUFFY: You put that thing in my home.
MONK: We knew the Slayer would... protect...
BUFFY: My memories... my mom's...
MONK: We built them.
BUFFY: <u>Then unbuild them</u>. This is my life you're --
MONK: You cannot... abandon...
BUFFY: I didn't ask for this. I don't even know what... what is she?
MONK: Human. Human, now, and helpless. Please, she is... an innocent in this, and she needs you.
BUFFY: She's not my sister.
MONK: She doesn't know that.
JOYCE: You're home.
DAWN: (intense) I wasn't bothering her.
JOYCE: What's that all about?
BUFFY: Nothing, Mom.
BUFFY: Just sister stuff.
DAWN: Go away.
BUFFY: Come on, Dawn.
DAWN: I said go! You deaf?
BUFFY: I'm sorry.
DAWN: You hurt my arm.
BUFFY: I know.
DAWN: Butthole.
BUFFY: Really sorry.
DAWN: I tell you I have this theory? it goes where, you're the one who's not my sister 'cause Mom adopted you from a shoebox full of baby Howler Monkeys, and never told you 'cause it could hurt your delicate baby feelings.
BUFFY: That's your theory?
DAWN: (nods) Explains your fashion sense and smell.
BUFFY: I'm sorry, okay?
DAWN: Broken record, much?
BUFFY: Can't even take an apology. You always do that, ever since --
BUFFY: I just had a bad day.
DAWN: Well, join the club.
BUFFY: Can I be president?
DAWN: I'm president. You can be the janitor.
BUFFY: Okay.
DAWN: Buffy?
BUFFY: Mmm?
DAWN: What's wrong with Mom?
BUFFY: I don't know.
