Jahvol, mein sibling. Who died and made you the Iron Chef?
Oops.
Buffy helped.
Mom! That's like, my kid name.
I'm fourteen. Nicknames like "little pumpkin belly" tend to flatline growing self-esteem.
I got some names for you...
Those never really work.
We're reading a heartbreaking work of staggering genius.
(duh) "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius."
Plus you can check my rain forest report and you know there's like eighty badillion old board games in the... hey!
You said I couldn't come.
(to Buffy) Told you you couldn't ditch me. (looking around) Whoa, Mr. Giles, this place is so, wow, I mean... check out all the magic junk!
When's it open? You know, for customers.
"You break it, you bought it." I heard you the first sixty times.
Willow! You gotta see this, they have the coolest talismen. Mans. Talis-guys...
(to Riley) You can't patrol. Buffy said.
Yeah, remember? It'd be easier if you didn't have to look out for anybody...?
(to Riley) She just said you look even cuter when you're all weak and kitteny, and she better go solo or you'd get hurt. So welcome to the club, she'll never let me go either...
What? What? What?
...can't all be born with big fancy Chosen One reflexes, you know.
What's wrong?
Buffy! Who said you could come in my room?!?
Tch'yeah! Like I even want to be related to your smelly... Ow! What are you doing?
Get off me!
Let me go, you freak!
I'm telling Mom!
What are you talking about?
Do you really think I care you're the Slayer?
Mom's coming back.
Hi, Mom.
You don't have to worry about her.
Want tea, Mom?
I made it for you.
(intense) I wasn't bothering her.
Go away.
I said go! You deaf?
You hurt my arm.
Butthole.
I tell you I have this theory? it goes where, you're the one who's not my sister 'cause Mom adopted you from a shoebox full of baby Howler Monkeys, and never told you 'cause it could hurt your delicate baby feelings.
(nods) Explains your fashion sense and smell.
Broken record, much?
Well, join the club.
I'm president. You can be the janitor.
Buffy?
What's wrong with Mom?
