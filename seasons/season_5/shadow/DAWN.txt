What is a CATscan, exactly?
But where'd they get CATscan from?
I mean, did they test it on cats? Or does the machine sort of look like a cat?
Guess I'm not hungry.
No. This is better. I just - I like ice cream soup. (then) I had my tenth birthday party here.
(nods) We'd just moved to Sunnydale and my mom rented the carousel for a whole hour for just me and my friends. Except I hadn't made any friends yet, so it was just me and Buffy and Mom riding this carousel by ourselves. Over and over and over again. For an entire hour. Just so's my mom felt like we'd gotten our money's worth.
She's never going to get better, is she?
I'm glad you're around.
Buffy's glad about it too.
She sure cries a lot less with you then she did with Angel.
Oh, god, yeah. Everything with him was all eeeee, you know?
You know, all "my boyfriend's a vampire" crazy crazy... Every day was, like, the end of the world. She doesn't get all worked up like that over you.
I think you've really been good for her.
Is she awake yet?
Can we take her home now?
