DAWN: What is a CATscan, exactly?
BUFFY: (shrugging) I'm not sure. An X-ray, I guess.
DAWN: But where'd they get CATscan from?
DAWN: I mean, did they test it on cats? Or does the machine sort of look like a cat?
BUFFY: (turns to her) Dawn...
TARA: Catchy.
GILES: Think so?
TARA: Uh huh. In a... hard to say sorta way. But, I think it's great.
XANDER: Just saying I think it's rude.
WILLOW: Wouldn't call it "rude..."
XANDER: Rude-ish. Rude-esque? Whatever you want to call it, when a person makes a "Destroy All Vampires" date, it's simple courtesy to wait for your co-destroyers. Am I right, Giles?
GILES: I'm almost certain you're not. Though, to be fair, I haven't been listening.
TARA: The new phone book's in with Mr. Giles' ad.
WILLOW: Ooh. Nice.
ANYA: Yay. Am I mentioned?
GILES: Not as such.
XANDER: Okay, we were supposed to meet up with Riley this morning to take on a nest o'vamps holed up in tomb. So we get there and guess what? Tell him, Will.
WILLOW: Tomb go boom.
XANDER: Yep, Captain America blowed it up real good. All by his lone wolf lonesome.
GILES: Hmm. Rather reckless of him.
XANDER: I'd say very rather.
GILES: All that aside, I should think you'd be  pleased to avoid the confrontation.
ANYA: That's what I've been saying. I mean,  I, for one, wasn't looking forward to  starting my day with a slaughter. (thoughtfully, pleased with herself) Which, really, just goes to show how  much I've grown.
GILES: In any event, since you're all here,  Tara and I could use some help  researching Buffy's mystery woman.
XANDER: (sarcastic) Oh, yeah, this has been fruitful. Trying to look up something you never saw and don't know the name of.
ANYA: Just do what I do - Flip through pages and look busy.
WILLOW: It'd just be nice if we knew where she was - where she's hiding out.
XANDER: No doubt lurking around some sewer, condemned church or rat- infested warehouse. You know, the usual haunts....
DREG: Most beauteous and supremely  Magnificent One...
DREG: This dark spell I hold in my worthless and scabby hand is our gift to you, most wonderful and tingly Glorificus, most--
GLORY: Call me "Glory." (tosses away a shoe) And get up, looking at you's hurting  my neck.
DREG: (desperate) Forgive me, Most Shiny Special One.  I beg of you to rip out my inadequate  tongue and--
GLORY: Gimme.
DREG: You should know, Your Elaborate Marvelousness, that this Dark Incantation was lost for eons and great dangers were faced to--
GLORY: Uh huh. Does this pump make my ankle look bony?
DREG: (recovering) No! No, Terrifically Smooth One. It is the epitome of ankles. To touch such an ankle would be the most... but I am not touching. I am backing away.
DREG: Owww! Thank you.
GLORY: Dreg, is it?
DREG: Yes! Dreg! Your Creamy Coolness has  honored me by speaking my name.  Your voice is like a thousand sweet  songbirds--
GLORY: (cutting him off) Yeah, I never tire of hearing that. (crossing away) Look, just so we're clear, this spell's going to work, right? I mean, nothing worse than a gift that doesn't work. Then I have to get all mad and kill you. It's a whole big thing.
DREG: It will work, Your Extremeness. Provided you have the other items you need.
GLORY: (menacingly) Oh, don't worry. I'll have them all right...
RILEY: (calling) Hello? Buffy?
SPIKE: Mmmm...
RILEY: What are you doing in here?
SPIKE: What, me?-- I was, uh... (stashing the sweater behind him) Uh...
SPIKE: What are you doing in here?
RILEY: Looking for the girl who's going to rip  your arms off when she finds out you  were in her room.
SPIKE: Oh, yeah? Well... me, too.
RILEY: Were you... Were you just smelling her  sweater?
SPIKE: (scoffing) Noo...
SPIKE: Yeah, alright. I did. It's a predator thing. Nothing wrong with it. Know your enemy's scent. Whet the appetite for the hunt...
SPIKE: Yeah, that's the stuff. Slayer musk.  Bitter and, and aggravating... Rrrr.
RILEY: Out.
SPIKE: Watch it! Easy! You're bruising the leather.
SPIKE: I know for a bleeding fact the Slayer wouldn't mind me being here.
RILEY: (sarcastic) Right. What's a little sweater sniffing between sworn enemies?
SPIKE: Your girl in the habit of buying her  enemies drinks? 'Cause she spent the  better part of last night with me -  doing just that.
RILEY: (not buying it) 'Cause you two are such tight pals.  Tell me another.
SPIKE: 'Kay. How 'bout this one? Twice in recent memory, she's had the loverwiccas do a de-invite on the house, keep out specific vamps. Ever ask yourself why she's never taken my name off the guest list?
RILEY: Because you're harmless.
SPIKE: Yeah. Right. Takes one to know, I s'pose. Least I still got the attitude. What've you got? A piercing glance? Face it, white bread, Buffy's got a type and you're not it. She likes us dangerous, rough, occasionally bumpy in the forehead region...
SPIKE: Hey! Hey!
RILEY: Am I dark enough for you now?
SPIKE: Here! Bloody pull me back in, you sod. I'm starting to sizzle.
RILEY: You don't know anything about Buffy. Never did. I'm the only one that knows what she needs.
SPIKE: Oh, yeah? That why you're with her  at the hospital right now. Giving her  what she needs.
RILEY: What are you talking about?
SPIKE: Don't you know? Didn't she call you?
RILEY: Tell me!
SPIKE: Mum is sickly. Buffy took her to the  hospital for a little prod and probe.  Bite-sized one went too. (then, enjoying himself) Funny her not calling you about it. I've known since last night.
SPIKE: Whoa, whoa! Blanket!
BUFFY: Riley.
RILEY: Hey. I heard and I thought maybe you'd need...
BUFFY: I do. I'm glad. I just - I didn't want  to... until we know what it is...
RILEY: I understand.
RILEY: How's she doing?
BUFFY: They did a CATscan. I was just going in to find out... (breaks from him) Can you stay with Dawn for a minute while I talk to mom? She's in the waiting room.
RILEY: You got it.
BUFFY: Um, hi...
BUFFY: Okay if I...?
JOYCE: Of course, baby, come in... Where's--?
BUFFY: She's with Riley. Watching TV in the  waiting room.
ISAACS: Excuse me, I'll just go check on the  status of the OR.
BUFFY: OR?
JOYCE: Dr. Isaacs says I'm lucky there's one  available on such short notice. Some  people have to wait days. Sometimes  weeks.
BUFFY: Mom...
JOYCE: (distracted, bemused) Lucky, he said.
BUFFY: Mom, what did they find?
JOYCE: A shadow.
JOYCE: I've got a shadow. There. (squinting) Or there. He showed me, but-- They have to do a biopsy to find out exactly what it is.
JOYCE: The doctor says it's too soon to be  concerned.
BUFFY: Right. No concern.
JOYCE: Right. It's just a shadow.
WILLOW: It feels like we're going around in circles.
XANDER: Our circles are going around in circles.  We got dizzy circles here, Giles.
GILES: (to customer) Ahh. Weeping Buddha... Deeply mystical. And it makes a lovely paperweight.
TARA: Maybe... She isn't in the books.
WILLOW: What do you mean?
TARA: I mean, what if she's not a demon. Or sorceress or spirit or whatever these books cover... What if she's something else altogether.
GILES: (to customer) Thank you, come again. (to Tara) Something new, you mean.
TARA: Something old. So old it predates the  written word.
WILLOW: Giles. The Dagon's Sphere. You said it  was created to repel...
GILES: (finishes the thought) "That which cannot be named."
WILLOW: 'Cause, I'm thinking, maybe she...
GILES: Predates language itself.
XANDER: (slamming a tome shut) Hey, if it means I don't have to read  any more, woo and, might I add, a big hoo.
GILES: If Tara's right, then we're blind. There's no way for us to determine her moves, her habits. (he turns back, thinking) Where she'll turn up nex--
GILES: Oh. I beg your--
GLORY: Yuh-huh. I want these.
GILES: (to Glory) Of course. Did you find everything  alright?
GLORY: No problemo.
GILES: Good. Your change... your copy of the receipt... and thank you.
GILES: She could be anywhere. But if she's as  powerful as Buffy says, I imagine it  won't be long before she makes her  presence known...
ISAACS: Everything went fine. They're moving  her to recovery now.
BUFFY: Do you have the results yet?
ISAACS: Why don't we sit down over--
BUFFY: No. Excuse me, no, Doctor. Not to be  rude, but I don't wanna sit down. I've  been doing nothing but sitting down  for hours. Just tell me...
ISAACS: Your mother has... The term is "low- grade glioma." It's a brain tumor...
ISAACS: The clinical name's Oligo... dendro... glioma. It's in the left hemisphere of the cerebrum. In your mother's case, the tumor seems to have started there. In other words, it hasn't spread there from another part of the body... which, in a way, is good news...
ANYA: Hey... Hey!! HEY HEY!!!
GILES: Anya, your "heys" are startling the customers.
XANDER: And pretty much the state.
ANYA: (to Giles) You sold someone Khul's amulet AND a Sobekian Blood Stone.
GILES: Yes, I believe I did.
ANYA: Are you stupid or something?
GILES: Allow me to answer that question with a firing.
XANDER: (to Giles) She's kidding. Ahn, we talked about  the employee to employer vocabulary  no-nos... That was number five.
ANYA: You never sell those things together!  It's bad news. Don't you know about  the Sobekites?
WILLOW: Ooh. I do. It was an ancient Egyptian  cult heavy into Dark Magic.
TARA: And the Khul's amulet... Wasn't that  a transmogrification conduit?
ANYA: Damn straight.
GILES: Be that as it may, I still don't see any  reason for concern. Sobekian  transmogrification spells have been  lost for thousands of years. And the  young woman I sold them to would  have to be someone of enormous pow--
WILLOW: Young woman?
GILES: Oh, Dear God...
XANDER: (a half-step behind) What?
ISAACS: I know this is very difficult. And, unfortunately, because of the nature of your mother's illness, things could progress very quickly.
BUFFY: Things? What things?
ISAACS: Symptoms. There are a fair variety that might present. Loss of vision or appetite, lack of muscle control, mood swings, personality changes-
BUFFY: (cutting him off) But what can we do?
ISAACS: Not much until we determine if the tumor's operable. Which we're working on.
BUFFY: Well, I... is there something I should be doing? Can I... help?
ISAACS: Well, there's some literature you might want to look at. If we aren't able to go in surgically, there are a number of new treatments which are very promising. Your mother's prognosis is a lot better today than it would have been only a year ago. Even if the tumor's not operable, she has a real chance.
BUFFY: What's "a real chance?"
ISAACS: Nearly one in three patients with this condition does just fine.
ISAACS: Now. Let me ask - does your mother's insurance company require copies of MRI and pathology reports?
BUFFY: (thrown) I'm not... sure...
ISAACS: Just let me know as soon as possible. And I could use some information regarding your mom's lifestyle and home environment. For instance, does she use a cell phone?
BUFFY: I think. She uses one of those... She had an ear thing, but...
ISAACS: Okay... Is your house near any power lines? Chemical plants? Waste disposal facilities?
BUFFY: I don't think so... Maybe.
ISAACS: Well, the more we know...
BUFFY: I'm sorry...
BEN: Excuse me, doc, but they told me you're needed in ICU.
ISAACS: I didn't get a page.
BEN: Why page when they can send me for the personal touch?
ISAACS: (to Buffy) I'm sorry, Miss Summers--
BUFFY: It's... It's okay.
BEN: Thought you looked like you needed a break. Guy's great, but he doesn't have that bone in his head, tells him when to back off.
BUFFY: You-- They didn't send for him?
BEN: I'm sure someone did somewhere. They always do. He really is a good doctor. Your mom's in good hands.
BUFFY: Thank you. Ben, right?
BEN: Right.
BUFFY: He was telling me there's nothing I can do.
BEN: And I'm gonna say the same thing. Give yourself a break. Listen, your mom's gonna be unconscious for at least another six, seven hours...
BUFFY: A break?
BEN: I just mean, go out. Get some air.  Come back later this evening,  talk to the doc then if you want.
BEN: My unsolicited advice of the day.
BUFFY: It's bad, Riley.
RILEY: I know.
BUFFY: I've got to do something.
RILEY: Do something?
BUFFY: Maybe there's some magic or something -- a healing spell.
RILEY: Healing spell? Buffy... People get sick. I don't think magic can help--
BUFFY: That attitude's not helping. I have to  try.
RILEY: Okay.
BUFFY: I need to talk to Giles. Can you drop Dawn off at school for me? Tell her I'll meet her at the magic shop when she gets out.
RILEY: Whatever you need me to do.
RILEY: Buffy...
RILEY: What do you want me to tell Dawn? About your mom.
BUFFY: Tell her... Tell her they don't know anything yet.
RILEY: You're melting.
DAWN: Guess I'm not hungry.
RILEY: Maybe I'm not making this any better.
DAWN: No. This is better. I just - I like ice cream soup. (then) I had my tenth birthday party here.
RILEY: Really.
DAWN: (nods) We'd just moved to Sunnydale and my mom rented the carousel for a whole hour for just me and my friends. Except I hadn't made any friends yet, so it was just me and Buffy and Mom riding this carousel by ourselves. Over and over and over again. For an entire hour. Just so's my mom felt like we'd gotten our money's worth.
DAWN: She's never going to get better, is she?
RILEY: Absolutely, she will. Summers women are tough.
DAWN: I'm glad you're around.
RILEY: Well... Thanks.
DAWN: Buffy's glad about it too.
DAWN: She sure cries a lot less with you then she did with Angel.
RILEY: Really. Angel... made her cry a lot, huh?
DAWN: Oh, god, yeah. Everything with him was all eeeee, you know?
RILEY: All...
DAWN: You know, all "my boyfriend's a vampire" crazy crazy... Every day was, like, the end of the world. She doesn't get all worked up like that over you.
RILEY: Uh-huh.
DAWN: I think you've really been good for her.
BUFFY: (mid-sentence) ...so I figure there has to be some kind of mystical cure, right? A spell or - or a potion or something. I mean, we have to look.
WILLOW: We can look - I mean we will - but I've never seen anything.
GILES: (gently) The truth is, the mystical and the medical aren't meant to mix, Buffy. I'm sorry - but the human brain is very delicate. Too much can go wrong.
TARA: Yeah. I've heard stories about people  trying healing spells... If we did  something - it could make things a  lot worse, Buffy.
ANYA: And we've done just about enough making things worse for one day, haven't we?
BUFFY: Why? What do you mean?
XANDER: (quickly) Nothing. Anya broke a... Bippidy Boppity Boo. A thing. Don't worry about it.
ANYA: I did not! I-
GILES: Anya. Buffy doesn't need to hear about your clumsiness right now-
ANYA: My clumsiness? That is so-
ANYA: -like me. Slippery, slippery butterfingers.
BUFFY: What happened?
GILES: Nothing to concern you. Now-
BUFFY: (hard) Giles.
GILES: That demon woman was here. The one who attacked you.
WILLOW: (too quickly) It's no biggy. Just got an amulet and a blood stone. (off Buffy's look) Okay. Biggy.
BUFFY: Oh my God. Are you guys okay? Did anyone get...
GILES: No, thankfully, there wasn't any violence to speak of.
BUFFY: Okay. That's... good. So how'd she get away with the bad mojo stuff?
ANYA: Giles sold it to her.
GILES: (defensive) Well, I didn't know it was her. I mean, how could I? (then) If it's any consolation, I may have overcharged her.
TARA: And - Anya figured out what the Demon Lady is up to.
ANYA: A few thousand years ago there was this cult. The Temple of Sobek.
BUFFY: Sobek...
ANYA: Reptile demon. Sobekites were reptile worshippers.
XANDER: Just once I'd like to run into a cult of bunny worshippers.
ANYA: (glaring at him) Great. Thank you very much for those nightmares.
XANDER: Sorry.
ANYA: Anyway, their high priest Khul had great, mystic powers. He forged an Amulet with transmogrifying crystal.
WILLOW: Transmogrifying is changing a living thing into a different kind of thing.
ANYA: Khul and the Sobekites started to transmogrify a race of reptile creatures. Different "blood stones" were created for different species of reptiles.
GILES: We've managed to decipher the markings on the blood stone I sol-- (then) --she left with. "Cobra." She's going to transmogrify a cobra.
BUFFY: So - she's making a monster. What for? What does it do?
GILES: That's the part... We're working on it.
BUFFY: Okay. You keep working on it. I'll go kill it.
GILES: Buffy-
BUFFY: I m going.
XANDER: Buff, this chick creamed you last time.
BUFFY: I wasn't ready for her last time. I am now.
WILLOW: But you-
BUFFY: (cuts her off/too intense) But what? I can't just sit here, Willow. I have to do something.
GLORY: Chant.
DREG: (in Ancient Arabic) "The form is vessel, rendered new... the will is given, in our domain...
GLORY: "Sobek, grant the power, that it may mold this wretched creature, that it may be reborn, that it may serve--" (then) Ugh. Dark Incantations. Always overwritten. Why can't they just cut to the--
BUFFY: Fight?
GLORY: (perfunctorily) Ooh. Uh. No fair. Attacking - Ouch - when I wasn't - Aah - even looking. Oof! Help!
GLORY: (flatly) Oh! Oh! Oh, Help m-- (dropping the act) No, this is no good. I'm out of the moment. You're not giving me anything I can use. (to Dreg) Dreg!! I'm not hearing chanting!
DREG: (in ancient Arabic) "The form is vessel, rendered new. The base is stone, bathed in blood. The gem is fire and elements rarefied..."
GLORY: (to Buffy) Work with me here.
GLORY: There. That feels more real, don't ya think?
GLORY: Even if I have to carry your performance.
GLORY: Scene.
BUFFY: We're not done here, demon-bitch!
GLORY: Please...
GLORY: Call me "Glory."
DREG: (in Ancient Arabic) Come into being and arise!
GLORY: Arise!!
GLORY: ARISE!! ARISE!!!
DREG: (reverently) He is arisen.
GLORY: 'Bout damn time.
GLORY: The power is yours to see what is unseen. To find what is shrouded in shadow. Already you know what I seek. I have given you form. Now find for me The Key.
GLORY: Yes. Let your vision guide you to its hiding place. Then return to me... and tell me where it lies.
GLORY: Now would be good!!!
GLORY: Fun!
GILES: "Alister Crowley Sings?" No, sadly, I don't carry it... But I do have some lovely whale sounds-
GILES: Excuse me a moment.
RILEY: Where's Buffy?
GILES: She left a little while ago.
RILEY: What? Where?
XANDER: That creepy demon woman is conjuring some kind of monster.
RILEY: And you let Buffy go after her? Alone?
GILES: "Let" isn't really a factor when Buffy sets her mind to something - you know that.
RILEY: (to Xander) She'll get herself killed. It's crazy.
XANDER: Yeah, crazy. Going off alone, half-cocked, instead of waiting for much needed back up... Charging in with a big ole' hand grenade- (stops/pointed) Oh, wait.
RILEY: This is different.
XANDER: Yeah, it is. Buffy needs something  she can fight, something she can  solve. I don't know what kind of  action you're looking for. (beat) Do you?
XANDER: Hey, I'm not trying to get --
RILEY: It's cool.
XANDER: You okay?
RILEY: Just a little crazed.
XANDER: I hear you.
RILEY: If she needs me...
GILES: Magic Box. Your one-stop spot to shop for all your--
GILES: Buffy? Are you all right?
BUFFY: No. I'm really not. I... I couldn't stop  her. I couldn't even slow her down.
BUFFY: Sunnydale Memorial.
GILES: Are you badly hurt? I'm coming right over--
BUFFY: I just want to warn you. The thing she  conjured is loose. Big snake thing.  Not Mayor big, but pretty lethal looking...
GILES: All right. I'll tell the others. We'll get weapons and fan out for--
BUFFY: School's out. Dawn should be on the  way over to you now. Giles--
GILES: Understood. We'll keep her safe here, until you arrive.
GILES: Yes?
BUFFY: Dawn. She's kinda fragile right now.  About mom.
GILES: We'll not say a word.
BUFFY: Thanks. Mom's going to wake up soon... So, you know - I have to be here. When the doctor...
DAWN: Is she awake yet?
BUFFY: Yeah, she's waiting for us.
DAWN: Can we take her home now?
BUFFY: (beat) We'll see.
BUFFY: Any monster reptile sightings?
GILES: None.
WILLOW: Tara and I did a mini-patrol earlier,  but the big snakie was nowhere in--
XANDER: Dawn!
WILLOW: Why was the big snake afraid of Dawn?
BUFFY: Watch the--
BUFFY: I've got to stop this monster before it  gets back to Glory...
BUFFY: That's what she called herself. Giles, she's  going to know Dawn's the Key if we don't-
GILES: We will.
DREG: Please... Mistress, Perturbed Yet Ultimately Merciful one...
GLORY: What is taking so LONG, Dreg? You told me snakey-wakey would find my Key! Why isn't he here with a beautiful message for me?
DREG: I grovel like a bug, most Silky and Effervescent Glorifi--
DREG: (blanches, corrects himself) Glory! Glory, Your Most Fresh-And- Cleanness. It's only a matter of time--
GLORY: Ugh, everything always takes time! What about my time? Does anyone appreciate I'm on a schedule here?! Tick tock, Dreg! Tick freakin' tock!
BUFFY: Do you want me to stay?
JOYCE: No - it's fine. I think I should talk to  Dawn alone.
BUFFY: Okay.
JOYCE: Do I have bed hair? I don't look like scary  mom - do I?
BUFFY: You look beautiful.
JOYCE: Okay... (then) Let's do this. But stay close.
BUFFY: Will do.
RILEY: You okay? You look pretty beat up.
BUFFY: Minimal damage of the fighting kind. It's all... the other kind.
RILEY: Come here.
RILEY: It's okay... You need to let it out. I'm  right here.
BUFFY: I can't. Not now. They need me, you know?
BUFFY: If I start now, I won't be able to stop.
