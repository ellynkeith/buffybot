Excuse me, I'll just go check on the  status of the OR.
Everything went fine. They're moving  her to recovery now.
Why don't we sit down over--
Your mother has... The term is "low- grade glioma." It's a brain tumor...
The clinical name's Oligo... dendro... glioma. It's in the left hemisphere of the cerebrum. In your mother's case, the tumor seems to have started there. In other words, it hasn't spread there from another part of the body... which, in a way, is good news...
I know this is very difficult. And, unfortunately, because of the nature of your mother's illness, things could progress very quickly.
Symptoms. There are a fair variety that might present. Loss of vision or appetite, lack of muscle control, mood swings, personality changes-
Not much until we determine if the tumor's operable. Which we're working on.
Well, there's some literature you might want to look at. If we aren't able to go in surgically, there are a number of new treatments which are very promising. Your mother's prognosis is a lot better today than it would have been only a year ago. Even if the tumor's not operable, she has a real chance.
Nearly one in three patients with this condition does just fine.
Now. Let me ask - does your mother's insurance company require copies of MRI and pathology reports?
Just let me know as soon as possible. And I could use some information regarding your mom's lifestyle and home environment. For instance, does she use a cell phone?
Okay... Is your house near any power lines? Chemical plants? Waste disposal facilities?
Well, the more we know...
I didn't get a page.
(to Buffy) I'm sorry, Miss Summers--
