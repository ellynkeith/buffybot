Call me "Glory." (tosses away a shoe) And get up, looking at you's hurting  my neck.
Gimme.
Uh huh. Does this pump make my ankle look bony?
Dreg, is it?
(cutting him off) Yeah, I never tire of hearing that. (crossing away) Look, just so we're clear, this spell's going to work, right? I mean, nothing worse than a gift that doesn't work. Then I have to get all mad and kill you. It's a whole big thing.
(menacingly) Oh, don't worry. I'll have them all right...
Yuh-huh. I want these.
No problemo.
Chant.
"Sobek, grant the power, that it may mold this wretched creature, that it may be reborn, that it may serve--" (then) Ugh. Dark Incantations. Always overwritten. Why can't they just cut to the--
(perfunctorily) Ooh. Uh. No fair. Attacking - Ouch - when I wasn't - Aah - even looking. Oof! Help!
(flatly) Oh! Oh! Oh, Help m-- (dropping the act) No, this is no good. I'm out of the moment. You're not giving me anything I can use. (to Dreg) Dreg!! I'm not hearing chanting!
(to Buffy) Work with me here.

Scene.
Please...
Call me "Glory."
Arise!!
ARISE!! ARISE!!!
'Bout damn time.
The power is yours to see what is unseen. To find what is shrouded in shadow. Already you know what I seek. I have given you form. Now find for me The Key.
Yes. Let your vision guide you to its hiding place. Then return to me... and tell me where it lies.
Now would be good!!!
Fun!
What is taking so LONG, Dreg? You told me snakey-wakey would find my Key! Why isn't he here with a beautiful message for me?
Ugh, everything always takes time! What about my time? Does anyone appreciate I'm on a schedule here?! Tick tock, Dreg! Tick freakin' tock!
