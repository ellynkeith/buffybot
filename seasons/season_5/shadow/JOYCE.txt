Dr. Isaacs says I'm lucky there's one  available on such short notice. Some  people have to wait days. Sometimes  weeks.

The doctor says it's too soon to be  concerned.
Right. It's just a shadow.
No - it's fine. I think I should talk to  Dawn alone.
Do I have bed hair? I don't look like scary  mom - do I?
Okay... (then) Let's do this. But stay close.
