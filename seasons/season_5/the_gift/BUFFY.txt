Hey. What's going on.
Are you guys havin' a fight? 'Cause, you know, fighting's not cool.
Have you ever heard the expression, "biting off more than you can chew?"
Wow. Never heard that one. Okay, how about, "Oh God, my leg, my leg?"
See -- now we're communicating.
It's what I do.
That's what <b>I</b> keep saying.
Vampire.
(to Giles) Anything?
Explain it to me again.
(calm and slow) Go through it again.
Pretty simple math, here. We stop  Glory before she can start the ritual.  There's still a couple of hours, right?
I don't want to hear it --
No you don't understand! We're not talking about this!
Say it. Come on, we're bloody well  talking about this, tell me to kill my sister!
No. She's not. She's more than that.  (trying to articulate it... ) More than family... my sister, my daughter...
She's me. The Monks made her out of me. I hold her and I feel closer to her than... It's more than just the memories  they built, it's physical, it's... Dawn is a  part of me. The only part that I...
Then the last thing she'll see is me protecting her.
I'm sorry. I love you all, but I'm sorry.
That worked against Frankenbot, but  to kill a true god... I don't think it's  enough. And I need you guys conscious ...
I like this.
Good heft to it. I just might do some  damage with this. (to Anya) Thanks.
But we still have no idea how to find her.
I'm sure.
So we wait.
Little bit. But I understand.
I know.
You try to hurt her, you know I'll stop you.
How many apocalypses is this for us?
I've always stopped them. Always won.
I sacrificed Angel to save the world.  I loved him so much... but I knew.  What was right. I don't have that  any more. I don't understand. I don't know how to live in this world,  if these are the choices, if everything's  just stripped away then I don't see  the point. I just wish... I wish my  mom was here.
It doesn't matter. If Dawn dies, then I'm done with it. I'm quitting.
You got anything for me?
I need you, Will. You're my big gun.
Willow, you're the strongest person here. You know that.
You're the only one who's ever hurt  Glory. At all. You're my best shot at  getting her on the ropes so don't get a  jelly belly now. What about those  spells you used on her before?
So...
Of course it should.
I don't like the exploding heads. The rest sounds solid.
No, that's good. That could be pivotal. (to Xander and Anya) Thanks, guys.
Way ahead of you. We got time?
I'll grab some weapons, too.
Spike. Shut your mouth. And come with me.
Weapons in the chest by the TV. I'll grab the stuff upstairs --
Come in, Spike.
We're not all gonna make it. You know that.
I'm counting on you, Spike. To help protect her.
I'll be one minute.
We on schedule?
Willow?
Willow, stay close but don't crowd her.  We'll follow in a minute. Everyone  knows their jobs. Remember, the ritual  starts, we all die. And I'll kill anyone  who comes near Dawn.
Give it a shot.
Will, you're up.
Okay then. Come and get it.
You don't seem very well. Do you need to lie down and have a tonic?
I notice that you're talking, whereas in your position I would attack me.
You keep saying I'm nothing, I'm  still not feeling attacked by you.  It's strange ...
It's not her.
Well that's the --
You're not the <b>brightest</b> god in the heavens, are you?
Whatever's handy ...
I'm sorry. You want to rip apart the  fabric of reality, destroy my world and  kill my sister and now you're introducing  the concept of fairness?
I guess I'll have to settle for causing it.
No... but my arm's not even tired.
You're a god ...
Tell her it's over. She missed her shot.  She goes. She ever -- EVER -- comes  near me and mine again...
Dawn.
I got you... You're gonna be okay ...
Come on!
What? We have to get down!
It doesn't matter. Nothing --
No!
It'll kill you!
No!
I don't care! Dawn, I won't lose you --
Dawnie... I have to --
Listen to me! There's no time, Dawn, please listen.
