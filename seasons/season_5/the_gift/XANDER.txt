Something going on out back?
Oh.
Why blood? Why is it Dawn's blood,  why couldn't it be, like, a lymph ritual?
We're not actually discussing dinner right now.
She's your sister and your daughter?
What about Ben? He can be killed,  right? I mean, I know he's an innocent,  but, you know, not, like "Dawn" innocent.  We could kill... a regular guy... (no we couldn't) God.
Should we join essences and become superslayer again?
How about we don't pick on my gi--
(looking at Anya) Smart chicks are so hot.
You know me and timing ...
(calling up) Yeah, we're on it... let's look over here! Where we didn't look yet!
So, are you any more relaxed?
No? I mean, it sounded like you... arrived. 
You don't have to be.
Spike's sexbot.. Why didn't they melt this thing into scrap?
(uncomfortable) I don't think Willow feels that way  about Buffy... I mean she's gone  through a lot of changes, but --
Right. Robotics. Science.
Other pervert.
Hey, shhhhh ...
No it's not. It's okay.
Care to wager on that?
Yes ...
I'm proposing to you, Anya, because it's not.
I believe it. I think we're gonna get  through this. I think I'm gonna live  a long and silly life and I'm not  interested in doing that without  you around.
Okay?
No?
Buffy. She'll find a way. Figure out what's gotta be done.
I've known her for five years, she  doesn't back down, she doesn't fail.  You see me doing anything remotely  heroical, that's something I learned  from her.
I'm looking for something in a broadsword ...
Hey, I happen to be --
I'm also a swell bowler.
("yikes") Shpadoinkle ...
Hey, check that out. I think I can work with that.
See you guys in there.
Beautiful... hold that pose.
And the glorified brick-layer picks up a spare ...
How are we doing?
Okay, we gotta charge or something ...
Are you talking to us?
Anya!
Anya... ?
