Harris. Sorry. Yeah?
Yeah. Right with you.
Huh. I'm not sure.
I guess-- yes.
(pleased) That would be great.
I already have an idea how.
Right. And there's just a point where you either move on or you just buy yourself a Klingon costume and go with it.
Thank you.
Anya? You there? (then) Look, I know you're still mad. But I figure you're probably sitting there, pretending you're not home, but listening anyway...
It stole my face. We have to fine it and we have to kill it!
Hold up. Do we really have to figure out what it is? Let's just go kill it.
Toth
(carefully) It does make sense. It must be Toth.
Should I go with you? I told Anya to meet me. I'd feel a lot better knowing she's safe from this creep.
Good thinking. When you kill the guy you'd better make sure you've got the one who's actually-
No. Trust me.
I really did. And you know why?
No. It's because I knew you wanted it. It's all for you.
Anya? You didn't see me today, did you? I mean, we didn't talk?
Good
Well, at some point we take our clothes off.
A car?
What are you talking about?
There's no hurry.
Fifty-years-- what is this... oh, wait a minute. This is about this.
You haven't been hurt like this since you became human. Maybe it's finally hitting you what being human means.
Yes, I think it is. You were going to live for thousands more years. Now you're going to  age and... die. It must be terrifying.
Being suddenly human? I think I can get what that would be like. And, I think that we can work through it.
I can't promise that. But it doesn't sound terrible, and that's saying something.
I promise you, Anya, very soon you won't be thinking anymore about getting older...
Get out! You don't belong here!
(to Anya) It's a demon. He stole my face. He's trying to trick you.
Anya... you know I'm me, right?
Don't worry Anya. I'll get rid of this <u>thing</u>. (to Xander) I'm thinking this is gonna last about fifteen seconds.
Anya, get out of the way.
It's all right Buffy, I have him.
No. I am.
Thank you!
Ow!
No way.
Eleven and a half.
What disk? This?
It's a nickel someone flattened on a railroad track. I found it on the construction site and I thought it was cool. It's not magic.
Hey! I just made a small cleaning deposit!
Oh yeah, that cleaning deposit's gone.
We're completely identical.
(smoothly to the others) She's joking.
Well I'm good at that stuff.
Yeah.
How weird was it when she called me â€˜Mr.'?
Kill us both, Spock!
