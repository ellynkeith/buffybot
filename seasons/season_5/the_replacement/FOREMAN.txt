Harris!
Harris!
In my trailer, okay? I'm talking to all the guys today. Job's winding down.
Sit down.
How long you work here, Harris?
Three months?
And you haven't done much construction before this, is that right?
I gotta tell you that's surprising, 'cause your work's been first rate. We've got another job lined up in Carleton when we finish here. You ever think about staying on full time?
I was thinking I'd have you head up the interior carpentry crew. See how it goes. It's more responsibility,  but the pay is better.
Good. Congratulations Harris. You and your girl should go out and celebrate.
