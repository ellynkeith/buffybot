(absently) I'm fine.
Hey! I was enjoying the studying!
Well it has been a long hard day with the  crusades. Guess I could take a little break  from the violence for some…. (sees the screen) Ooh! Fighting!
Mmm. So good. More…
Hey! The rubbing went away.
Yeah, it's pretty good- (then, off movie) Oh, give me a break! See you'd hit the  big guy first, a flying kick. Then clear out the  little ones - bam, bam! Oh! <u>Now</u> with the  flying kick?!
Well, it would drive you crazy if this was an army  movie and they were all, you know, saluting  backwards and, and… invading all willy-nilly.
Anyway, you can't blame me for being critical.  Willow's the same way when we watch movies about witches, isn't she Xander?
Just warning you now, Xander. I probably won't be doing that.
Nice. And not subterranean. Very… above-terranean.
(quickly) But without unpleasant slavery associations.
How badly did you hurt him?
He ran away, right?
So a mythic triumph over a  completely indifferent foe?
He called you a toth. It's a British expression. It means, like, a moron.
Sophisticated? I talk men's fashion  with him while I cut his head off?
The city dump, where smells go to relax and be themselves.
Spike, we're looking for a demon. Very tall, robe, skin kinda hanging off, deep voice…
Xander!
They hung up.
Okay, the guy wants to fight with weapons, I've got it covered from A to Z. From ax to… ze other ax.
Relax. Another day, another demon.
Go away, Dawn.
Get out of here!
She's watching us like a big freak.
Good work, Dawn. You gave her a headache.
But part of it is Dawn's.
I guess I should go. I'm thinking maybe the guy actually likes smelly places. So I'm going to do a whole tour  de funky, starting with the sewers.
Um….
Riley, this Toth guy walks softly and  carries a big blasty rod. He almost hurt  Xander - I'm not going to let him hurt you.
Dracula wasn't the first guy to come Buffy Hunting. Lots of baddies want the slayer trophy kill. I can handle it.
(interrupting) Toth. The demon with the creepy-stick.
It's gotta be. He hit you with the blast and somehow that allowed him to take your form. Giles, couldn't that be what the stick-thing did?
Well, I was looking for Toth anyway. I guess now I start, you know, looking for <u>you</u>.
Go be with her. If you were running around looking for the double too... well, let's just say I don't want to run into you and kill the wrong one.
Right. You hit all the places he might go to blend in as Xander. I'll keep checking out the places Toth might hang--
Wait. Willow, how do you know about this.
But, wait, what make you think yours was the right one?
He was kind of... forceful and confident.
You always say that.
So, same thing for the Xanders, right? Both of them need to stay alive or they both die.
Can't this thing go any faster? Ultimate Driving Machine my ass.
Hey, Riley. Do you wish --
No? You don't even know what I was going to say!
Well, you have been kinda rankly about the whole "Slayer" gig. Instead of Slayer Buffy you could have Buffy Buffy.
I just know how unfun it can be. Bad hours, frequent bruising, cranky monsters-
We better get there soon. If Xander kills himself, he's dead. (thinks) You know what I mean.
Xander!
Xander-- Gun-holding Xander. Give it to me.
Yeah. Okay, look, Xander...s. You've been split in two. You're both Xander. And you can't kill each other. I mean you <u>can</u>, but it would be bad.
Yes! How?
What number am I thinking of?
Wrong. Oh! But, see?!
(covering) Oh... um... sense of direction, good night-vision, stuff like that.
Look.
We'll explain on the way to Giles--
Oh great. Rod boy.
Sword!
It's like... there's a little scar here, then there it is over there.
(aside, to Giles) They're kind of... the same now.
You look good, Xand. Clothes, hair... I think you came out ahead in this whole thing.
I guess maybe we shoulda kept both of you ‘til we had all the heavy lifting done, huh?
Hey, Anya, I see you've joined the  not-sling-wearing crowd.
Ah. That sounds... good?
(to Riley) You got more for me to carry?
Sure.
