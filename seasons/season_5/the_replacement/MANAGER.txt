Xander Harris?
Ah.
I see.
Phone and electricity are hooked up. There's a private balcony, ceiling fans, closet spaceâ€¦
I brought an application for you to fill out.
We run your credit check based  on the application.
And we'll be asking for first, last, security and a small cleaning deposit.  The total's at the bottom of the sheet.
I was going to call you, Mr. Harris. Let you know your credit checked out fine. But I really didn't think you'd be back.
I'm sure you'll like the building.
I think someone said you're currently in your parents' basement?
Well, I hope you'll be happy here, Mr. Harris. We're certainly happy to have you. (moving closer) And if you need anything, day or night, please call me. I... um... I'm leaving my home number here...
Call me. Even, you know, for non-business stuff... we could maybe do something...
(calling back in) Remember... any time!
