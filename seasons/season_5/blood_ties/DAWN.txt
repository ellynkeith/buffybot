Hey! You guys doin' a spell?
Cool. Can I help?
Yeah, whatever.
Hey. We on the case?
Fine. What's up with you? You get  into the sugar again?
The usual. A big square building filled with  boredom and despair.
We're s'posed to imagine what we'll be like  in ten years and write a letter to our future  self. The teacher's clearly so out of ideas.  Wanna help?
(to Buffy) Is it about that weird girl that came to the  house?
Like you'd tell me anyway. "Dawn's too  young." "Dawn's too delicate --"
I think you're just freaking out 'cuz you have  to fight someone prettier than you. That's the  big crisis, isn't it?
(opening her diary) Maybe you're just getting soft in your  advanced age. She didn't look that tough  to me.
Open mine.
It's when we visited Dad that summer in  San Diego. I put the shells on myself.  They're the ones we picked off the beach.
Jeez, don't get all Movie of the Week. I  was just too cheap to buy you a real present.
We need plates. It's cake time.
(frustrated) Why does everybody start acting all weird  when I'm around?
I'm not an idiot. I know you're talking  about me.
(to Joyce) They were talking about me. Just like  everybody else is.
Oh. Right. Of course. Can't let Dawn hear  <u>anything</u>. Fine. I'll just go to bed. That  way I won't accidently get exposed to,  like, <u>words</u>.
(heart pounding) Jeez! Lurk much?
What is - (incredulous) Are you giving Buffy a <u>birthday</u>
<u>present</u>?  Oh my god, weird! Plus, chocolates?  Lame! And the box is all bent and you  know she'd never touch anything from  you anyway!
(laughs) Is that supposed to scare me?
Sorry, it's just - come on. <u>I'm</u> badder  than you.
Am too. You're standing in the bushes  hugging a bent box of chocolates. I'm -
No. I'm breaking into the magic shop.  To steal things.
I can take care of myself.
Wanna come steal some stuff?
You know how to do that or not?
A book.
I don't want the book - just what's inside.  I think it was Giles' notes. He was standing  here with it but when I turned around it was gone -
Wait - here' something. "Tarnis, twelfth  century. One of the founders of the Monks  of the Order of Dagon. Their sole purpose  appears to have been as protectors of the Key."
(reading) "The Key is not directly described in any  known literature, but all research indicates  an energy matrix vibrating at a dimensional  frequency beyond normal human perception.  Only those outside reality can see the Key's  true nature." Outside reality? What's that  mean?
"The Key is also susceptible to necromanced  animal detection, particularly those of canine  or serpent construct…"
(shell-shocked) Is this blood?
It's blood, isn't it? It can't be me. I'm not  a Key. I'm not a thing…
What am I? Am I real? Am I anything?
Why didn't you tell me?
How old am I now?
No. the monks. When did they…
(devastated) I've only been alive for six months?
You don't know that. You don't know  anything! I'm a Key - everything about  me's just… made up.
You worry 'cause you have to - I'm  your job. "Protect the Key," right?
Yeah? How do you know? Maybe it's just  another fake memory. From my fake family.
(softly) Get out.
(screaming, totally losing it) Get out! GET OUT! GET OUT!
I'm not going. Blobs of energy don't need an  education. Do they?
I'm not sick! I'm not anything!
Don't tell me what to do. You're not my  mother.
I changed my mind. I'd rather be at school.
Bet you can't push me all the way 'round!
No you can't!
Please. You see me, right? Look at me.
You know what I am, don't you? You all  know? Tell me.
What am I?
You know what the Key is? Where did I  come from? Who made me? What am I?  Please -
No…
(absently) Don't like 'em anyway.
Too squishy. When I was five, Buffy  told me they were monkey brains…
(bitterly) No. My "mom" 's fine.
I don't have a sister.
It's not Buffy. It's me. I'm the one that  doesn't exist.
No, you don't understand! It's not real! (re: her own body) None of this! They made it!
I'm nothing! I'm just a thing the Monks  made so Glory couldn't find me! I'm not real!
(stunned) How do you know about the -
Wait. Calm down. Just tell me…
What's wrong with you?
You're - you're -
You're Ben?
You don't remember?
I'm… I'm… not sure. What's it look like?
Maybe…
Maybe if you told me more about it,  I'd know if I've seen it.
So this Key thing. It's been around for  a long time.
Is it… evil?
What's it for? I mean if it's a Key,  there's gotta be a lock, right?
So, what does it open?
No, I -
What's wrong with you?
Buffy!
Why do you care?
No, I'm not.
I was so scared.
(suddenly remembering) Wait! Ben! He -
(confused) He was here. He was trying to help me,  but then he… I think he might have left  before Glory came. I - I can't remember.
Is she mad? About the fire?
Really? Okay… Good.
Think she'd raise my allowance?
