Look, I know mom wants to gather and make with the merry tomorrow night, but with  everything going on -
I just don't know if this is a good time to  break out the party piñata, Will. We need to  stay focused if we're going to find a way to  stop Glory.
She's right. I've thrown everything I got at  her, and she just shrugs it off.
There's more than one?
I guess Glory found one. The question is why?
Okay, so we know where Glory's from, but  what do we know about <u>her</u>? She's tough, yeah,  but no bolts of lightening or blasts of fire.  Shouldn't a god be able to do that kind of stuff?
(getting it) -- are crazy people.
We have to come up with something to stop her.
That's a start.
(evasive) I don't think we have to worry about that.
We did. Giles and me. We know where it  is, so -
If Glory found out you knew where it was -  I didn't want to put you in that kind of danger.
Willow -
You're right. (soft, to Giles) It's time.
They're going to be risking their lives.  They deserve to know.
(steeling herself) There's something I have to tell you.  About Dawn…
You always think harder is better. Maybe next  time I patrol, I should carry bricks and use a  stake made out of butter.
Hey, Dawn. That true? How was school  today?
Just how I remember it.
So what's the homework sitch?
Maybe later. I got a few things to take  care of.
Glory. And no, it's not.
Right. A young delicate pain in the butt.
Dawn, Glory is powerful, evil and is no way  prettier than me.
You are very, very wise. Now gimmie  gimmie gimmie!
Pretty! Thank you!
(opening it) It's not going to explode, is it -
Yeah. I remember.
Thank you.
No.
Dawn? What are you doing? Party getting  slow out there?
Okay, you know what? Let's not have this  exchange of images right now…
I wasn't really expecting one. No contact  with civilians. I'm sure there's a code  name for it. Like "radio silence." It's  "greeting card silence."
Maybe it's time for a new tradition:  birthdays without boyfriends. It can  be just as fun.
What did you do?!
Thanks.
(softly, no) This is family stuff. We need to deal with it.
We were going to. We just…
(softly) Six months ago.
Dawn, Mom and I know what we feel.  I know I care about you, know I worry…
No, I worry because my <u>sister</u> is cutting  herself -
Dawn…
(avoiding the question) Did you find anything new?
We need answers, Giles. We need to find  out everything about the Key. What's it  for? Who created it?
No, this isn't about her. It's Dawn. She  deserves to know where she came from.  She needs to know. Or - or it's just gonna  eat away at her…
You let Dawn find out like that? From  books and papers? You hate me that  much?
You could have stopped her. You could  have -
She shouldn't have found out like that.
You have no idea how I feel.
She needs time, mom. We can't force her  to be all right with this.
No, but if I were her I'd want a little space  right now to try to figure things out, not my  mom and sister coming at me from all sides.
She probably feels like she can say or do anything  now. It won't matter because she's not real.  We're not her family. We don't even know what  she it.
I'm not. I'm saying that's how she feels.
It's not that simple. We're not going to fix  this with a hug and a kiss and a bowl of soup.  Dawn needs to know what she is. She needs  real answers.
Mom, the Slayer is the only thing standing  between Dawn and a god from the Bitch  Dimension that wants to stuff her in some  kind of lock and give her a good twirl. I  need to be out there doing my job or else.
Willow's spell. Glory -
Dammit!
No, mom, she could've burned the  house down -
It wasn't Glory. Dawn's been acting…  It hasn't been easy for her. She tore her  room up, burned all her diaries -
Since she was seven. I remember too, Will. (combat mode) We have to find her, fast. Before Glory or the  Knights of Hack and Slash figure out what she  - <u>who</u> she really is. Mom's at the house in case  Dawn comes back there. The rest of us'll split  up and sweep the city. Spike, reach out to your  dank and darks, find out if they've seen -
I'll pay you. Just do it.
(brusquely) They were to her. And to me.
Well, for now we have to assume… (determined) Anya, stay put in case she shows up here.  Giles, Xander - sweep the center of town.  Willow, Tara - west side. Spike, you're  with me on the east. We have to -
(soft) Just find her. Please.
Oh yes I can!
Dawn?! DAWN?!
Shut up.
You were right. It's my fault. I should  have told her.
And then what?
What about the carousel?
Nothing?
Anything could have happened to her.  I mean, not just Glory… (gravely) We'd better check the hospital.
She wasn't brought in.
(nearing meltdown) I don't know. I can't -
Glory.
Conversation's over, Hellbitch.
(that did it) He's! Not! My! BOYFRIEND!
Giles, now!
Dawn!
(to Dawn) Get back!
(stunned) What did you do to her?
Where did you send her?
Dawn!
Are you all right?! Did she hurt you?
Because I love you. You're my sister.
Yes, you are. Look.
Blood. Summers' blood.
Just like mine.
It doesn't matter how you got here or  where you came from. You are my  sister. There's no way you could annoy  me as much if you weren't.
Me too.
It's okay. We'll thank him the next time  we see him. (then) We'd better get back. Mom's freaking out.
I think you sort of have a get out of jail  free card, on account of big love and trauma.
(cutting her off) Don't push it.
