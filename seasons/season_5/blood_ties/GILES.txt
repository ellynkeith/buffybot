That might pose some difficulty. From what  the Council has been able to discover from the  Book of Tarnis and other sources, Glory and  two of her fellow Hellgods ruled one of the  particularly nastier demon dimensions.
And all pushing at the edges of this reality,  trying to find a way in.
(re: Book of Tarnis) There's nothing here to indicate. Just vague  references to chaos and destruction.
Usually, yes. Being in human form must be  severely limiting her powers. All we have to  worry about now is her being immortal,  invulnerable, and on the constant brink of  insanity.
The way I see it, living in our world is  affecting her mentally. She's only able to  keep her mind intact by extracting energy  from us - from the human, well, from the  human brain.
She absorbs the energies that bind the human  mind into a cohesive whole. But once drained,  all that's left behind -
I'm afraid that's why there's been a marked  increase in the ranks of the mentally disturbed  here in Sunnydale.
There were reasons.
Are you sure?
I'm not sure our basic work-out is challenging  you anymore. Perhaps we should make it harder.
Very amusing. (smiling at Dawn) I bet Dawn feels like that with her school  work sometimes.
I'm fairly certain I wasn't.
Well, let's wait a second on that. I assume  you're asking about her existence, not her  intentions…
Perhaps I should stay. Just in case…
(gently) We're looking, but -
How did she find these? How did she even  get in here in the first -
Willow's warning spell wasn't tripped?  You're sure?
The Bronze perhaps?
Takes getting used to. To think, that a  bright fourteen year-old is actually living  energy, thousands of years old.
(nods) People have killed, died, and summoned  armies to control the Key.
Your point being…?
(helping Willow) That's an incredibly dangerous spell for  an adept at your level.
