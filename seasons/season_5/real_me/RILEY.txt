Morning, Mrs. Summers. You look great.
What, it's a nice outfit. Besides, 'I'm here to violate your firstborn' never goes over with the parents. Not sure why.
Hey, kid.
(caught off guard) Now it's my turn to be surprised. Thought we had plans today.
Well, you said "come over tomorrow and we'll hang." Then I said "'kay." Not the  invasion of Normandy, but still a plan.
We're not hanging, are we?
(understanding) Slayer training.
I've no doubt. Okay, we'll hook up later.
No, no. I'm plotting your death, but in a happy way.
(sincere) Buffy, I know what this means to you. I think it's great you've got this new mission.
See you tonight. (calls out) See you, kid!
Like dead shop keepers.
(dubious) Soâ€¦ You want your mother to give you  space to be the slayer - and shield you from it at the same time.
I'm getting that. What's the deal, Buffy? You seem really-
Tense.
Uh uh. Back to what I was saying before  we were rudely attacked by nothing. You seem really tense.
I mean, domestically tense. You're on Dawn's case a lot.
Well, yeah. You're like her idol, Buffy.
You know what I mean. You have super powers, and college, a studly yet sensitive boyfriend-
She doesn't get the sacrifices. She's a kid.
(through his grin) Buffy, c'mon. They've killed once that we know of. She <u>could</u> be a threat to you.
Lot of weapons for somebody you  weren't sweating twenty minutes ago.
You had to, it was your job-
That head wound looks bad. We better get her to a hospital.
