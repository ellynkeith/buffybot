Dawn Patrol! Check this out: They put cheese on round bread. It's gonna be big.
Total non-sweat.
We will. Just gonna play with some  matches, run with scissors, take candy  from… some guy, I don't know his name.
You nut! Your mom loves you both equally. (sotto) But, if I'm wrong, I find cash usually helps tip the scale. Slip Joyce a ten or twenty once in a while and we'll see who's the favorite.
That means you're winning.
Yes. Cash equals good.
And I bet she'll be real sorry she missed your call. (looking past her) Afraid you and your buddies are gonna have  to come back and be killed by Buffy later.
(squinting at her) They're what now?
(through his laughter) Nothing. What could be funny? Just… Look  out, it's the terrifying Harmony gang! Ooooo!
I just… I just can't picture anyone  pathetic enough to be following-
Is that Brad Bellamy? Ha! (calling to him) Hey, Brad, who'd have thought when you  were beating up kids in gym class, you'd  end up Harmony's lapdog.
You heard wrong.
(turning to her) Dawn, I'm handling this. (turning back) Shut up, Harmony.
Don't feel like having another hair-pulling contest with you.
(to minions) Invitation was for one.
And we'll be ready for you. Stakes,  crosses… the whole enchilada.
Buffy is not going to be happy about this.
Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction.
And Ruffles have ridges. Buffy, there's  actually a more serious side to all this…
Well… (working into it) She did come here to kill you.
Uh, yeah, actually, she… Harmony…  kinda happened to sorta get an invite.
Buff, it was an accident. She didn't mean it.
No, but believe me… Nobody feels worse  than her right now.
Buff, I left word with Willow. She'll come, do a return engagement of her <i>un</i>invitation spell -  probably still has the stuff from last week - and,  bang-boom, you're back in the Fortress of Solitude. All better.
Okay, granted, it was Dawn's bad, but  she's just a kid-
(seeing: ) Anya!
Easy, Ahn. Don't try to talk.
