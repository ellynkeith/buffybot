The rest of the car's nice, too.
Hey, Dawn.
Shop's kinda dark. Maybe it's closed.
(calling out) Mr. Bogarty!
(explains) The owner. (others still looking) I'm in here a lot.
(calling) Dawn?
Dawnâ€¦ Are you okay?
Yeah.
They're gonna be a little while longer, doing the detective thing. Best non-Scoobies like you and me stay out of their way.
Do you wanna thumb-wrestle?
She was pretty shaken up.
It's just... I think... It's tough for her. Not being able to... allowed to... you know, help.
Out. You. You guys. The slayer circle.
I know. You're right. It's just hard. The outsider feeling.
Well, yah. Kinda am.
Willow, it's okay. We're talking about Dawn--
Xander's a sweetie.
It's no one.
You guys all just have this really tight bond. It's hard to break into that. I'm not even sure I want to.
(interrupting, again amused) I don't think so. But maybe something like that would be nice for Dawn. I do worry about her sometimes.
