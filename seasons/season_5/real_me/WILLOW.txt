Magic shop. Had some charms on back order.
(hugging her) Hey, Miss Dawny. How's my favorite chess partner? Still leading with your knight?

I'm sure.
You're completely one of the gang now. Everyone accepts that. You're one of the good guys.
Maybe I can talk to the others and we can do something. You know, a kind of scoobie initiation-- (then) Oo, maybe we can all wear some special ring that identifies us as members--
You don't have to. She's got big sister Buffy happily looking out for her.
