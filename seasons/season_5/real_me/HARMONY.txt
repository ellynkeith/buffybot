Okay, hi. First of all I want to thank  everybody for a really successful raid last night on the Magic Shop… (clapping) Good good job, minions.
Yes, you deserve it. Secondly, somebody remembered to pick me up the sweetest unicorn…
Brad…?
(teasing) Guess someone was feeling guilty for standing me up in tenth grade.
Anyway, those books you brought me to help with the plan - I've been skimming  through some of the book jackets all morning and, let me tell you, I think there's some pretty useful stuff in there so…
(pointing to him) Yes, um… Sorry, forgot your name.
Cyrus, right. Peaches' friend. What's your question?
Ew. That's rude. I barely know you.  And you're a minion!
Ohh, the <u>plan</u>! Well, first let me say, I'm really psyched about it. And I hope the  rest of you guys are just as-
(quickly) Tonight!!
We kill the Slayer tonight.
I know you're in there!
What do you mean she's not in there?!
They're not my buddies. (with attitude) They're my <u>minions</u>.
Minions. You know… Lackeys. They work for me.
What's so funny?
Stop laughing!
You should know all about being somebody's lapdog. I hear you were a good little puppy for Dracula.
Aw, don't feel bad. I hear that mind control thing he does works really well on weak,  fraidy-cat, losers. You didn't stand a chance.
Make me.
You're the hair-puller, you big girl.
Not such a pushover anymore, am I?
I've been working out. Learning some  new tricks… Honing my…
…instincts.
What a total disaster! My first plan. I so  wanted it to go well. Plus I didn't even get to kill stupid Xander Harris. God, that was  so embarrassing.
(defeated) No, it's no good. Buffy's going to expect us now. The whole surprise is blown.
Stop.
(coolly) Spikey. (correcting herself) I mean… Spike.
I <u>feel</u> good.
How've you been?
It's okay, we used to go steady. Spike, Mort. Mort, this is-
(remembering) Oh, yeah… (to Spike) What's up with that?
Mort. Just give us… couple minutes. 'Kay?
(re: Mort) He's really testy. Some of us are thinking about voting him out of the gang.
Oh, yeah. (pumping herself up) I've got my own gang now.
Uh huh. I mean - shut up! We're gonna kill the Slayer.
I'm not going to make the same mistakes  you did. I'm doing my homework. Reading  books and stuff.
You just can't stand the fact that I'm my own person now. There comes a time in a woman's life when she realizes she has to take that next step. I've taken it. I've found the real me, and I like her.
You'll see… Buffy'll be dead by sunrise. I've got a plan.
(hardly) Nnno-o! Much, much better one.
I'm not gonna tell <u>you</u>.
I'll do that. And after Buffy's gone, I'm gonna kill everybody in this town who's ever been mean to me. <i>Spike</i>!
Guys! New plan…
(applauding) All right, once again, nice work minionators! I'm really, really proud of you guys.
Ah, Mort. I trust you've made our  guest… comfortable.
Yeah, I know. I was being… you know… sarcastic or whatever.
Anyway, I'm feeling really good about this new plan, people. I think it's a winner.
We don't. Not yet.
Because. That's not the plan. (sighs wearily) Do I have to go over the plan again? We use the sister as bait. We send Buffy a note…
(ignoring her) We send Buffy a note telling her if she wants to see her sister again, she has to come, alone, to a place we choose. She comes, we jump  her, we kill her.
I guess…
We're not eating the girl.
'Cause… That's not the plan.
They don't respect me. They pretend they do, but deep down they think I'm nothing. I mean, I'm the one who put this group together. Me! But they treat me like I don't even matter…
You have any idea what that feels like?
They have no idea how much pressure I'm under. I have to make all the hard decisions. And it's hard!
Excuse me. I didn't hear anybody knock.
Oh, really. You have a plan you like better?
I don't think I like your attitude, Mort. (to others) Kill him for me.
All right. You're all on my list.
(whining) This isn't fair. Okay, so things haven't  been perfect. I just need a little more time to grow into my leadership role.
(sotto, to Mort) And you didn't like the plan.
(stepping forward) So, Slayer… At last we meet.
I'm the half-wit? Uh, excuse me, but you're  the one who's fallen into my…
(less secure) …uh, trap.
Oo, good shot, Mort. I think you've… got her on the, uh-
