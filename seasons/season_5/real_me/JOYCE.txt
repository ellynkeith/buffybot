So, Buffy, what are your plans today?
Oh, that's great…
You can take Dawn shopping for her  back-to-school supplies.
I know, honey. But I've got the Gurion showing tonight and there's so much to  do to get the gallery ready.
I'm sure Mr. Giles won't mind dropping you and your sister off at a department store afterward.
Buffy, I realize the importance of your  new… slayer… thing…
But I really could use your help.
Thank you, Riley.
So not only didn't you take your sister  shopping for school supplies, you brought her to a murder scene.
I asked one favor of you, Buffy. To keep an eye on your sister. And now you want to unload her so you and Riley can go out.
Well, I've got to be at the pre-showing  Reception in half an hour. Who's going to watch Dawn?
(to Buffy) And who are you going to get on such short notice?
Xander?
Xander, hi, thanks for doing this.
Dawn, you be good.
Sorry it ran so late. Everything go okay?
Well, at least one of us is supposed  to be in bed by now.
