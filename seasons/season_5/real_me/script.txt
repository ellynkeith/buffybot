GILES: Focus inward… Let the world fall  away… fall away… fall aw-
DAWN: Can we go now?
JOYCE: So, Buffy, what are your plans today?
BUFFY: Well, Giles and I-
BUFFY: Giles and I are making a little magic shop run this morning. Need to pick up some supplies for my new improved training sessions.
JOYCE: Oh, that's great…
BUFFY: Well, yeah, thanks, it's kinda exci-
JOYCE: You can take Dawn shopping for her  back-to-school supplies.
BUFFY: What?
DAWN: <i>Mom</i>! I thought you were taking me.
JOYCE: I know, honey. But I've got the Gurion showing tonight and there's so much to  do to get the gallery ready.
BUFFY: No, but, see, Mom…
BUFFY: We're just going to the magic shop.  No school supplies there.
DAWN: Yeah, Mom - I'm not going to <u>Hogwarts</u>.
DAWN: Jeez, crack a book sometime…
JOYCE: I'm sure Mr. Giles won't mind dropping you and your sister off at a department store afterward.
BUFFY: Yes, he'll mind. This is supposed to be  quality Watcher/Slayer time. I told you Dawn totally messed up my training yesterday.
DAWN: Did not.
BUFFY: Oh, you know you did, too!
JOYCE: Buffy, I realize the importance of your  new… slayer… thing…
JOYCE: But I really could use your help.
RILEY: Morning, Mrs. Summers. You look great.
JOYCE: Thank you, Riley.
BUFFY: Suck up.
RILEY: What, it's a nice outfit. Besides, 'I'm here to violate your firstborn' never goes over with the parents. Not sure why.
RILEY: Hey, kid.
DAWN: I'm not a kid…
BUFFY: This is a surprise of the nice kind.
RILEY: (caught off guard) Now it's my turn to be surprised. Thought we had plans today.
BUFFY: Plans? We planned plans?
RILEY: Well, you said "come over tomorrow and we'll hang." Then I said "'kay." Not the  invasion of Normandy, but still a plan.
BUFFY: Oh, right, uh…
RILEY: We're not hanging, are we?
BUFFY: Giles is on his way over to pick me up.
RILEY: (understanding) Slayer training.
BUFFY: Slayer shopping, actually. (defensive) But it's just as important.
RILEY: I've no doubt. Okay, we'll hook up later.
BUFFY: You're not mad?
RILEY: No, no. I'm plotting your death, but in a happy way.
BUFFY: (teeny bit worried) Oh good…
RILEY: (sincere) Buffy, I know what this means to you. I think it's great you've got this new mission.
RILEY: See you tonight. (calls out) See you, kid!
GILES: I truly do. But I'm certain Riley understands better than anyone the importance of training.
GILES: Will you <u>please</u> stop fiddling with the radio and sit down.
BUFFY: Lotta books on this shopping list you gave me. Any of them come on tape? You know, read by George Clooney or somebody cute like that?
GILES: We're entering a whole new realm here, Buffy. One for which even I, myself, am not entirely prepared. Are you ready for this commitment?
BUFFY: I was kidding. This Betty's ready.  Color me committed.
GILES: (shifting the drive shaft) Blast!
BUFFY: Put it in "neutral" again, huh.
GILES: Not accustomed to automatic transmissions. I loathe this… Just sitting here, not contributing.  No. No, this just isn't working out.
BUFFY: Giles, are you breaking up with your car?
GILES: Well, the damn thing <u>did</u> seduce me.  All red and sporty.
BUFFY: Little two-door tramp.
GILES: (sighs wearily) I don't know… I've been so at loose ends. Searching for something to make me feel…
BUFFY: Shallow?
GILES: Perhaps, as I am going to act as your  watcher again, a modicum of respect might  be appropriate…
BUFFY: Do I hafta?
GILES: I'm actually serious, Buffy. There's going to be far less time for the sort of flighty, frivolous-
DAWN: Hey, there's Willow and Tara!
GILES: Oo, they haven't seen my new car.
WILLOW: Wow. Sharp wheels, Giles.
TARA: The rest of the car's nice, too.
GILES: Thank you. Handles like a dream.
BUFFY: (to Willow) Where you two headed?
WILLOW: Magic shop. Had some charms on back order.
DAWN: Willow, hi!
WILLOW: (hugging her) Hey, Miss Dawny. How's my favorite chess partner? Still leading with your knight?
TARA: Hey, Dawn.
BUFFY: Giles and I figured out a schedule around school. A block of time every day to just focus on my new Slayer training.
WILLOW: (gasp) That's a work ethic! Buffy, you're  developing a work ethic!
BUFFY: Do they make an ointment for that?
WILLOW: People gotta respect a solid work ethic. (then) Look at you. Motivated Buffy, eager to  soak up learning… You and I are going  to have so much fun this semester.
BUFFY: Yeah… that reminds me. With the whole  training schedule, I kinda had to drop a class…
WILLOW: That's understandable. Your slayer studies are way more important.
BUFFY: So I won't be taking Drama with you.
WILLOW: (stung) What?! You have to. You promised!
BUFFY: I know, Will, but Giles was saying-
WILLOW: The hell with Giles!
GILES: I can hear you, Willow
WILLOW: (ignoring him) Drama's just Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. You can blow off training Tuesday  and Thursday afternoons, can't you?
BUFFY: What happened to "people gotta respect a work ethic?"
WILLOW: <u>Other</u> people. Not me. There's a whole best friend loophole.
TARA: Shop's kinda dark. Maybe it's closed.
GILES: That's odd.
BUFFY: Think "odd" just got upped to "bad."
GILES: Hello? Is anyone here?
TARA: (calling out) Mr. Bogarty!
TARA: (explains) The owner. (others still looking) I'm in here a lot.
WILLOW: Maybe this happened really late in  the night when no one was-whoa!
BUFFY: Will?
WILLOW: I'm fine. Just tripped over…
WILLOW: Mr. Bogarty.
DAWN: What is it? Is-Is he okay?
BUFFY: It's nothing you need to see, Dawn. Go wait outside.
DAWN: I don't wanna wait outside. What happened to-
BUFFY: Dawn!
DAWN: Ow, that hurts…
DAWN: You're hurting me. I'm telling.
BUFFY: (releasing her) I don't have time for this. Just do like I say and wait here.
LUNATIC: Hey! What are you doing?
DAWN: Wha--?
LUNATIC: What are you doing HERE? Can't loiter. No loitering… That's why I'm a cat… Quiet... cat's in the cupboard, but they  find you anyway… and it hurts… (remembering some agony) Please make it stop…
LUNATIC: Shut up! SHUT UP! They'll hear you!
DAWN: (shouting) BUF-uhh!
LUNATIC: Shhhhh! (intimately) I know you… curds and whey… I know what you are…
LUNATIC: You don't belong here.
TARA: (calling) Dawn?
TARA: Dawn… Are you okay?
DAWN: Is- Is that guy dead in there?
TARA: Yeah.
TARA: They're gonna be a little while longer, doing the detective thing. Best non-Scoobies like you and me stay out of their way.
TARA: Do you wanna thumb-wrestle?
DAWN: Okay.
BUFFY: Judging by the bite fest I'd say this  was more than one vampire.
GILES: I'd make it four, at least.
BUFFY: Looks like someone's put together a  new fang club.
WILLOW: I've cross-checked the inventory and some things were definitely taken. Mostly books, including one called <u>A Treatise on the  Mythology and Methodology of Vampire Slayers</u>.
BUFFY: Shoot. Was that the only copy?
GILES: This could be very serious, Buffy. Whoever's leading this pack of vampires appears to be  interested in learning more about you.  Perhaps searching for weaknesses or- (noticing something) Good lord…
BUFFY: (anxious) What? What is it?!
GILES: (re: page in binder) I had no idea the profit margin for a shop  like this could be so high.
GILES: I mean, look at this… Low overhead, Out- of-State orders, International… No wonder there's never any trouble attracting new  owners. This place is a virtual-
BUFFY: (interrupting) Deathtrap?
WILLOW: So what's the next step?
GILES: Buffy I think you should begin an  immediate search for their lair.
BUFFY: (nodding) I'll get Riley to join me.
WILLOW: Aren't you forgetting something, Buffy?
GILES: Impressive square footage…
WILLOW: You're on Dawn duty.
BUFFY: Oh, duty. I've got to drop my sister off at home first. (then) My mother's gonna kill me.
GILES: And I'll bet the deathrate keeps the rent down - oh. Something's been taken from this case. (pointing to a vacant pedestal) See here?
BUFFY: What did they take?
GILES: Perhaps an item of great value. Or power. Possibly even-
WILLOW: A ten-inch ceramic unicorn, imported from Thailand.
BUFFY: Is that valuable?
WILLOW: (reading) List price: $12.95
GILES: Which begs the question: what sort of unholy creature fancies cheap tasteless statuary?
HARMONY: Okay, hi. First of all I want to thank  everybody for a really successful raid last night on the Magic Shop… (clapping) Good good job, minions.
HARMONY: Yes, you deserve it. Secondly, somebody remembered to pick me up the sweetest unicorn…
HARMONY: Brad…?
HARMONY: (teasing) Guess someone was feeling guilty for standing me up in tenth grade.
BRAD: (sotto, to others) What? Had to get her something. She sired me.
PEACHES: (aside to Cyrus) Sire-whipped.
HARMONY: Anyway, those books you brought me to help with the plan - I've been skimming  through some of the book jackets all morning and, let me tell you, I think there's some pretty useful stuff in there so…
HARMONY: (pointing to him) Yes, um… Sorry, forgot your name.
CYRUS: Cyrus.
HARMONY: Cyrus, right. Peaches' friend. What's your question?
CYRUS: When are we gonna do it?
HARMONY: Ew. That's rude. I barely know you.  And you're a minion!
MORT: He means "the plan." When are we  gonna do the plan?
HARMONY: Ohh, the <u>plan</u>! Well, first let me say, I'm really psyched about it. And I hope the  rest of you guys are just as-
MORT: (snapping) When?!
HARMONY: (quickly) Tonight!!
HARMONY: We kill the Slayer tonight.
JOYCE: So not only didn't you take your sister  shopping for school supplies, you brought her to a murder scene.
BUFFY: I didn't bring her to it. It just sorta came upon us…
BUFFY: That's not what I meant.
JOYCE: I asked one favor of you, Buffy. To keep an eye on your sister. And now you want to unload her so you and Riley can go out.
BUFFY: To patrol. I'm working. It's not like we're going to the sock-hop.
JOYCE: Well, I've got to be at the pre-showing  Reception in half an hour. Who's going to watch Dawn?
BUFFY: (yelling back) Yes, you do!
BUFFY: So you're saying if I can get a babysitter over here before you leave, I can go  patrol now.
JOYCE: (to Buffy) And who are you going to get on such short notice?
BUFFY: (to Joyce) Xander.
JOYCE: Xander?
DAWN: O-kay.
XANDER: Dawn Patrol! Check this out: They put cheese on round bread. It's gonna be big.
JOYCE: Xander, hi, thanks for doing this.
XANDER: Total non-sweat.
JOYCE: Dawn, you be good.
XANDER: We will. Just gonna play with some  matches, run with scissors, take candy  from… some guy, I don't know his name.
ANYA: (sees Dawn) Hello there, little girl.
TARA: She was pretty shaken up.
WILLOW: Well, sure. Bloody death and stuff.  (comforting smile) She'll be okay.
WILLOW: What?
TARA: It's just... I think... It's tough for her. Not being able to... allowed to... you know, help.
WILLOW: Help?
TARA: Out. You. You guys. The slayer circle.
WILLOW: Oh, well, Buffy really doesn't-- And I think Dawn's a little young to--
TARA: I know. You're right. It's just hard. The outsider feeling.
WILLOW: Tara. You're not an outsider.
TARA: Well, yah. Kinda am.
WILLOW: (adamant) No. No, you're not.
TARA: Willow, it's okay. We're talking about Dawn--
WILLOW: (protective turn) Is someone making you feel uncomfortable? Is it Xander? It's Xander, isn't it?
TARA: Xander's a sweetie.
WILLOW: It's Giles. It's 'cause he's British and doesn't understand about stuff.
TARA: It's no one.
TARA: You guys all just have this really tight bond. It's hard to break into that. I'm not even sure I want to.
WILLOW: I'm sure.
WILLOW: You're completely one of the gang now. Everyone accepts that. You're one of the good guys.
WILLOW: Maybe I can talk to the others and we can do something. You know, a kind of scoobie initiation-- (then) Oo, maybe we can all wear some special ring that identifies us as members--
TARA: (interrupting, again amused) I don't think so. But maybe something like that would be nice for Dawn. I do worry about her sometimes.
WILLOW: You don't have to. She's got big sister Buffy happily looking out for her. 
BUFFY: …so then my mom goes off on me about how  I'm supposed to watch Dawn and make sure  she's shielded from stuff that might upset her-
RILEY: Like dead shop keepers.
BUFFY: She didn't see him! A foot maybe. A dead  foot. Which is bad, okay, but - hello - I see dead stuff all the time. You don't see mom shielding me.
RILEY: (dubious) So… You want your mother to give you  space to be the slayer - and shield you from it at the same time.
BUFFY: Thank you, logic boy. Did I mention this is a rant? Sense has no place in it.
RILEY: I'm getting that. What's the deal, Buffy? You seem really-
BUFFY: Trash can. From a distance it looked kinda…
RILEY: Tense.
BUFFY: Not really - more, round and… squat and-
RILEY: Uh uh. Back to what I was saying before  we were rudely attacked by nothing. You seem really tense.
BUFFY: Well, yeah. We have a new vampire gang in town.
RILEY: I mean, domestically tense. You're on Dawn's case a lot.
BUFFY: I guess. It's just - I know it's always been this way… She's the baby. But, for some  reason, it's really been getting to me lately. She's always around.
RILEY: Well, yeah. You're like her idol, Buffy.
BUFFY: Idol? I don't think so. Unless she likes to spill stuff on her idol's new leather pants and-
RILEY: You know what I mean. You have super powers, and college, a studly yet sensitive boyfriend-
BUFFY: -and a pesky life-or-death job I can't quit or even take a break from.
RILEY: She doesn't get the sacrifices. She's a kid.
BUFFY: Which is what bugs! She gets to be a kid,  and she acts like it's the biggest burden in the world. When, sometimes, all I want to do is curl up in mom's lap and not worry about the  fate of the world. I'd like to be the one who's  all protected, who's waited on-
DAWN: …hand and foot. Always getting her own way. Always the favorite.
XANDER: You nut! Your mom loves you both equally. (sotto) But, if I'm wrong, I find cash usually helps tip the scale. Slip Joyce a ten or twenty once in a while and we'll see who's the favorite.
ANYA: Look at this. Now I am burdened with a husband and several tiny pink children and more cash than I can reasonably manage.
XANDER: That means you're winning.
ANYA: Really?
XANDER: Yes. Cash equals good.
ANYA: Oh, I'm so pleased! Can I trade in the children for more cash?
HARMONY: I know you're in there!
HARMONY: What do you mean she's not in there?!
XANDER: And I bet she'll be real sorry she missed your call. (looking past her) Afraid you and your buddies are gonna have  to come back and be killed by Buffy later.
HARMONY: They're not my buddies. (with attitude) They're my <u>minions</u>.
XANDER: (squinting at her) They're what now?
HARMONY: Minions. You know… Lackeys. They work for me.
HARMONY: What's so funny?
XANDER: (through his laughter) Nothing. What could be funny? Just… Look  out, it's the terrifying Harmony gang! Ooooo!
HARMONY: Stop laughing!
XANDER: I just… I just can't picture anyone  pathetic enough to be following-
XANDER: Is that Brad Bellamy? Ha! (calling to him) Hey, Brad, who'd have thought when you  were beating up kids in gym class, you'd  end up Harmony's lapdog.
BRAD: Screw you, Harris.
HARMONY: You should know all about being somebody's lapdog. I hear you were a good little puppy for Dracula.
XANDER: You heard wrong.
HARMONY: Aw, don't feel bad. I hear that mind control thing he does works really well on weak,  fraidy-cat, losers. You didn't stand a chance.
DAWN: Shut up!
XANDER: (turning to her) Dawn, I'm handling this. (turning back) Shut up, Harmony.
HARMONY: Make me.
XANDER: Don't feel like having another hair-pulling contest with you.
HARMONY: You're the hair-puller, you big girl.
DAWN: Oh, yeah? Come inside and say that.  Xander'll kick your-
ANYA: Dawn, NO!
XANDER: (to minions) Invitation was for one.
HARMONY: Not such a pushover anymore, am I?
HARMONY: I've been working out. Learning some  new tricks… Honing my…
HARMONY: …instincts.
XANDER: And we'll be ready for you. Stakes,  crosses… the whole enchilada.
XANDER: Buffy is not going to be happy about this.
BUFFY: Har- (snort) Harmony has mi-minions?
XANDER: Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction.
BUFFY: I'm sorry… I just… (new laughter) Harmony has minions!
XANDER: And Ruffles have ridges. Buffy, there's  actually a more serious side to all this…
BUFFY: (eyes tearing) I hope so. I'm having trouble breathing. (pulling herself together) Like what?
XANDER: Well… (working into it) She did come here to kill you.
RILEY: (through his grin) Buffy, c'mon. They've killed once that we know of. She <u>could</u> be a threat to you.
ANYA: Especially now that she can enter your house anytime she wants.
BUFFY: What?
XANDER: Uh, yeah, actually, she… Harmony…  kinda happened to sorta get an invite.
BUFFY: You can't invite her in. Only someone who lives here can-
BUFFY: Where is she?!
ANYA: In her room. I think she's still pretty freaked out.
BUFFY: DAWN!
XANDER: Buff, it was an accident. She didn't mean it.
BUFFY: Oh, well, that makes it all right then, doesn't it?
XANDER: No, but believe me… Nobody feels worse  than her right now.
HARMONY: What a total disaster! My first plan. I so  wanted it to go well. Plus I didn't even get to kill stupid Xander Harris. God, that was  so embarrassing.
MORT: We'll go back later.
HARMONY: (defeated) No, it's no good. Buffy's going to expect us now. The whole surprise is blown.
PEACHES: (to Cyrus) Who you growling at?
CYRUS: Not me. My stomach. If I don't eat  someone soon, I get dizzy.
PEACHES: Let's go back to the lair. That census taker may not be empty yet.
BRAD: Not me. Night's young. I wanna see some action.
SPIKE: Happy to oblige. And here I thought it  was gonna be a slow night.
SPIKE: Step on up, kiddies. Thrashings for all.
HARMONY: Stop.
SPIKE: Well… Hello, Harm.
HARMONY: (coolly) Spikey. (correcting herself) I mean… Spike.
SPIKE: Long time. You look good.
HARMONY: I <u>feel</u> good.
SPIKE: (a sly smile) I remember.
HARMONY: How've you been?
SPIKE: Not bad. Just got a brand new telly  in my crypt, so-
MORT: Why are you talking to him?
HARMONY: It's okay, we used to go steady. Spike, Mort. Mort, this is-
MORT: I know who he is. He kills our kind.
HARMONY: (remembering) Oh, yeah… (to Spike) What's up with that?
SPIKE: (shrugs) Bloke needs a hobby, don't he? Piss off, Mort.
HARMONY: Mort. Just give us… couple minutes. 'Kay?
HARMONY: (re: Mort) He's really testy. Some of us are thinking about voting him out of the gang.
SPIKE: Gang?
HARMONY: Oh, yeah. (pumping herself up) I've got my own gang now.
SPIKE: Is that what those circus freaks are?
HARMONY: Uh huh. I mean - shut up! We're gonna kill the Slayer.
SPIKE: Singing my song now, are you. Should  pay me royalties for that one. Or at least get your own tune.
HARMONY: I'm not going to make the same mistakes  you did. I'm doing my homework. Reading  books and stuff.
SPIKE: What, <u>Evil for Dummies</u>? Look at you, all puffed  up and mighty. Thinking you're the new Big Bad.  It's… well, let's face it, it's adorable.
HARMONY: You just can't stand the fact that I'm my own person now. There comes a time in a woman's life when she realizes she has to take that next step. I've taken it. I've found the real me, and I like her.
SPIKE: Hope you'll be very happy together. In the  meantime, save slayer slaying for the professionals.
HARMONY: You'll see… Buffy'll be dead by sunrise. I've got a plan.
SPIKE: Let me guess: snatch one of her friends, use 'em as bait, leader her into a trap? That sort of thing?
HARMONY: (hardly) Nnno-o! Much, much better one.
HARMONY: I'm not gonna tell <u>you</u>.
SPIKE: Thought as much… Well, best o-luck. Let me know how this arch villain thing works out for you.
HARMONY: I'll do that. And after Buffy's gone, I'm gonna kill everybody in this town who's ever been mean to me. <i>Spike</i>!
HARMONY: Guys! New plan…
RILEY: Lot of weapons for somebody you  weren't sweating twenty minutes ago.
BUFFY: That was before I found out my sister gave Harmony a backstage pass to kill us in our sleep.
XANDER: Buff, I left word with Willow. She'll come, do a return engagement of her <i>un</i>invitation spell -  probably still has the stuff from last week - and,  bang-boom, you're back in the Fortress of Solitude. All better.
BUFFY: No, not all better, Xander. It's not like she hasn't  grown up in this house, knowing the rules…
BUFFY: (an aside) I mean, please, I'd never have Harmony over here when she was alive.
XANDER: Okay, granted, it was Dawn's bad, but  she's just a kid-
BUFFY: Will everyone <u>stop</u> saying that? I was a kid when I met my first vampire and, somehow, I remembered the rules.
RILEY: You had to, it was your job-
BUFFY: It was common sense. But nobody expects even that much from Dawn, do they?
BUFFY: She's got to be more careful. I can't be there to watch over her twenty-four hours a day. I just can't.
ANYA: Hey, don't-Dawn!
ANYA: What do you think you're doing?
DAWN: Leave me alone.
ANYA: (dragging her back) I will after you come back inside the house.
DAWN: Let go of me!
ANYA: No. It's not safe out here.
BUFFY: What's that door doing-
XANDER: (seeing: ) Anya!
ANYA: Vampires… they took…
RILEY: That head wound looks bad. We better get her to a hospital.
ANYA: Took her…
XANDER: Easy, Ahn. Don't try to talk.
ANYA: Dawn…
BUFFY: What? Anya, what about Dawn?
ANYA: She ran out… Took her… Vampires.
BUFFY: Oh God. Oh God…
BUFFY: (not looking back) Take care of Anya.
HARMONY: (applauding) All right, once again, nice work minionators! I'm really, really proud of you guys.
HARMONY: Ah, Mort. I trust you've made our  guest… comfortable.
HARMONY: Yeah, I know. I was being… you know… sarcastic or whatever.
HARMONY: Anyway, I'm feeling really good about this new plan, people. I think it's a winner.
CYRUS: When do we eat the girl?
HARMONY: We don't. Not yet.
CYRUS: Why not?
HARMONY: Because. That's not the plan. (sighs wearily) Do I have to go over the plan again? We use the sister as bait. We send Buffy a note…
PEACHES: More notes.
HARMONY: (ignoring her) We send Buffy a note telling her if she wants to see her sister again, she has to come, alone, to a place we choose. She comes, we jump  her, we kill her.
MORT: So it doesn't really matter if we're actually holding the Slayer's sister, as long as she  thinks we are, she'll walk into the trap.
HARMONY: I guess…
CYRUS: So it won't make any difference if we  eat the girl now.
HARMONY: We're not eating the girl.
PEACHES: Why not?
HARMONY: 'Cause… That's not the plan.
SPIKE: Bollix! Gonna have to pinch me one a those satellite dishes.
SPIKE: (coolly) Well, well… speaking of dishes. To  what do I owe this unpleasant-
SPIKE: Oww! Bloody hell!
BUFFY: I don't have time to banter with you,  Spike. Where's Harmony's lair?
SPIKE: Haven't seen her in months. How should I--?
SPIKE: Owww!
BUFFY: Where is she?
SPIKE: At least lay off the nose.
SPIKE: Okay, okay… Used to have a cave in the north woods. About forty meters past the overpass construction site.
SPIKE: Owww!!! I'm telling you the truth!
BUFFY: I know.
HARMONY: They don't respect me. They pretend they do, but deep down they think I'm nothing. I mean, I'm the one who put this group together. Me! But they treat me like I don't even matter…
HARMONY: You have any idea what that feels like?
DAWN: A little.
HARMONY: They have no idea how much pressure I'm under. I have to make all the hard decisions. And it's hard!
HARMONY: Excuse me. I didn't hear anybody knock.
MORT: We've been talking it over, and we  decided we don't like this plan.
PEACHES: Except for Brad. He abstained.
HARMONY: Oh, really. You have a plan you like better?
MORT: We're going to feed on the girl. And kill you. Maybe not in that order.
HARMONY: I don't think I like your attitude, Mort. (to others) Kill him for me.
HARMONY: All right. You're all on my list.
HARMONY: (whining) This isn't fair. Okay, so things haven't  been perfect. I just need a little more time to grow into my leadership role.
MORT: Time's up.
DAWN: My sister is <u>so</u> gonna kill you.
BUFFY: Can't say she didn't warn him.
HARMONY: (sotto, to Mort) And you didn't like the plan.
BUFFY: Close your eyes, Dawn.
HARMONY: (stepping forward) So, Slayer… At last we meet.
BUFFY: We've met, Harmony, you half-wit.
HARMONY: I'm the half-wit? Uh, excuse me, but you're  the one who's fallen into my…
HARMONY: (less secure) …uh, trap.
BUFFY: Harmony, when you tried being head  cheerleader, you were bad. When you tried to chair the Homecoming committee, you were really  bad. But when you try to be bad… You suck.
DAWN: Buffy, watch out!
HARMONY: Oo, good shot, Mort. I think you've… got her on the, uh-
MORT: You're outta stakes, Slayer.
BUFFY: You are gonna be in so much trouble  when we get home.
DAWN: (weakly) Oh, yeah? Well, I'm telling Mom you  slayed in front of me.
BUFFY: Then I'll have to tell her you ran out of the house  in the middle of the night and got Anya hurt…
JOYCE: Sorry it ran so late. Everything go okay?
BUFFY: Yeah. Got the vamps, and we, uh,  watched some TV.
JOYCE: Well, at least one of us is supposed  to be in bed by now.
BUFFY: So how was the exhibit?
BUFFY: Giles, are you sure about this?
GILES: Why wouldn't I be?
BUFFY: Well, apart from the fact that magic shop  owners in Sunnydale have the life expectancy of a Spinal-Tap drummer, have you ever run a store before?
