You want me, Slayer? Come and get me.
All about you, baby.
(you are boring and I loathe you) Hello, sweetbreads. Did you have fun?
You <u>paid</u> for it?
(suddenly interested) How's that?
God, that would be pleasant.
Get myself a decent seat. If the Slayer's gonna die... I'm gonna watch.
Uh, you're welcome...
Lei-ach Demon. Fun little buggers; big with the marrow-sucking.
Except me.
I don't care what happens.
Uh huh... Why don't I make this simple...
Gyahh!
(re: Tara) There's no demon in there. (shakes off the last twinge) That's just the family legend, am I right? Bit of spin to keep the ladies in line? Oh, you're a piece of work. I like you.
Yeah, you're welcome.
