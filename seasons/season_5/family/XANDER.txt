Okay, just -- ow! Thumb! Necessary opposable thumb!
He called me a bad name! I think it was bad; it might have been latin.
Still can't believe you're giving up this cherry corner suite.
Still, hard to give up. Got the two entrances, lotta opportunities for bawdy french farce -- and everybody loves bawdy --
'Cause you'll have back up, baby. She's messin' with ALL of us.
I don't know that Taglarin stuff.
I got something... picked out, yeah...
It's a big deal for Will, though -- I mean you are gonna be there?
Gimme sugar. I've come to buy sugar.
(joins them, re: books) The answer's somewhere here. It's right in front of us and we're too blind to see it. (off their looks) What? You've never wanted to say that? (off their looks) I'm helping, I'm reading, I'm quiet.

It's over there!
You're dealing with all of us.
Except Spike.

Well, that's to keep you from boozing it up.
