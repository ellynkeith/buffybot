Are all these magic books?
So all these books got spells in 'em? Turn people into frogs?
(to all of them) So, are you all witches? Hey, don't do a spell on me...
Well what do you know.
What's the matter? Don't got a hug for you big brother?
Tara didn't say she had a brother? (smiles) I'm a dirty little secret.
Nice to meet you.
What, alla you hang out? (to Tara, playfully) That's more people than you MET in high school. (to the others) Tara wasn't too social back when. I don't think she <b>spoke</b> till she was eight --
Well, duh, birthday girl. We came down in the camper, been all over the campus --
Dad, you know, and cousin Beth. We went all over campus looking. They oughta circle back here in a bit.
Look who I found...
(holding a skull) Didn't Uncle Jeff have a scar like this? He could have been dug up...
Nice to meet you all.
Dad, you're not gonna let them --
Tara, if you don't get in that car I swear by God I'm gonna beat you down.
