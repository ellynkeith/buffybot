-- and took her to the pound. And at the pound there were lots of other kitties, and there were puppies, and some ferrets.
Yes. Many dolphins at the pound.
There was the front of a camel. A half-camel.
Well, now you've ruined the ending. There was a whole exciting middle part with the French Resistance.
Yeah... do you mind if I keep the light on? I was gonna look up some spells.
(smiling) Vixen.
Well, I just wanna keep up with you. And I'm... I'd like to be useful. You know, to the gang. I just never feel... useful.
Think Buffy found anything out tonight?
Yeah, you learn her source and we'll introduce her to her insect reflection.
(much quieter) That was funny if you've studied Taglarin mystic rites and... are a total dork...
I really do.
Stupid...
I just thought that'd be funny, you know, if her power was centered in --
Willow, this is D-Donny.
(indicating the gang) And these are m-my friends.
How did you find-- I mean, how come you came?
We?
(a bit urgent) No, we should find them. We could go -- (looks at Willow) -- I should go meet them.
Dad! Hi.
It's such a s-surprise.
Hey, Beth.
Oh. (pause) Oh, these are friends... this is Mister Giles, he runs the shop.
Okay.
Yes sir.
Yeah.
They're okay. You know. Families are always...
Usually. You wanna get into research mode?
I didn't... I didn't kn-know you were coming.
I don't think it's... It won't mean that --
Y-yes.
Home?
I would never hurt them.
I... it doesn't feel... evil. Sir.
Hey.
Oh. You should go, they don't need me for that, you can fill me in...
That didn't work.
Well, I'm tired. We can try it tomorrow.
My family's here, I can't just... not everything is about your friends and stuff
No, no, I'm... there's just so much going on. I'm just... I'm real tired.
I'll see you in the morning and you can fill me in.
Blind Cadria, desolate queen, work my will upon them all, your curse upon them, my obeisance to you.
Beth! What are you --
Sorry we didn't get to have dinner... everything was so sudden.
Beth, I'm not... I'm n-not coming back with you.
I don't think so.
What?
Like what? You c-can't just come here --
Yes.
No they won't.
N-no.
No! It wasn't anything!
It was just so they wouldn't see!
So they wouldn't be able to see the demon part of me. Please don't tell dad. It's harmless.
Buffy behind you!
Oh God...
Blind Cadria, lift your veil, give evil form and break my spell --
I'm sorry... I'm s-so sorry...
I w-was just trying to hide... the spell went wrong...
I didn't want you to see... what I am.
I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.
I'll go. (to everyone) I'm very sorry.
No! No...
OW!
(hands on nose) He hit my nose!
(to Willow) I'm not a demon.
He hurt my nose.
Dad.
Just go.
No, see, 'cause your insect reflection represents your insignificance in terms of the karmic cycle.
No, no, it is, but you have to... understand the...
Best birthday.
I was just afraid if you saw the kind of people I came from... you wouldn't wanna be anywhere near me.
Every time I... even at my worst, you always make me feel special. How do you do that?
