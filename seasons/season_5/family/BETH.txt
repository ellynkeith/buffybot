Hey.
Tara?
I was looking for you.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay, see if you needed help with anything... packing...
You're not?
You selfish bitch.
I knew it. I knew you were gonna do something like this!
You don't care the slightest bitty bit about your family, do you? You dad's been worried sick about you every day you've been gone. There's a house needs taking care of, Donny and your dad having to do for themselves while you're down here living God knows what kind of lifestyle. Is it true you've been doing magic?
Well then you deserve whatever you get. Come down here, doing spells... I can't wait 'til your little friends find out the truth about you. They will, you know. Doesn't matter how innocent you act, they'll see.
They will unless you do some kind of spell on them... (off Tara's reaction) You did.
You did something to them. I'm telling your dad.
You think you can just go around cursing people -- your dad's gonna pop --
Don't you see how out of control you are? You've been lying to those people for a year, now you put a spell on them? Is that right? Is that a human thing to do?
Now I'm telling your father. If he doesn't force you to come home -- and I think he should -- I <u>know</u> he's gonna tell your friends the truth. If I were you I'd tell them first. Then I'd tell them goodbye.
Well, I hope you'll all be happy hanging around with a disgusting demon.
What?
Well, I don't... what does it matter?
Are you happy now?
