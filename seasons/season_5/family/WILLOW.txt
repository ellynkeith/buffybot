(sleepy) Were there dolphins?
Was there a camel?
Did the kitty get chosen by some people?
I'm sleepy.
That's fine. I don't need to be snuggled...
You've been spell gal night and day lately.
You are. You're essential.
At the factory? I don't know. If there was something, I figure she would've called us.
I think that's smart.
You wanna start taking stuff down to the car?
Okay, guys, now remember, you gotta be at the Bronze by eight.
Tomorrow night! Tara's birthday!
You all can still come, right? I mean, I know there's this new evil and all...
'Her insect reflection'... that's so good...
Brother?
Hi.
Yeah, sure --
That's so weird. Your whole family.
They seem nice.
They make you crazy.
Sure.
Hey.
Was... dinner fun?
Well, there's scoobyage afoot. Giles called a meeting about our spanking new menace.
No no, you gotta come. This demon chick is supposed to be really powerful and I was thinking maybe we could try that spell, you know, the one to find demons...
Yeah, but we only tried it one time. I think I got the ingredients wrong.
You sure you don't --
(hurt) Sorry.
Okay.
Great. We'll be demon hunters.
Am I late? Did I miss exposition?
There's always gonna be a part of your life he can't get near. That's just part of relationships that people have to deal with, even if they feel shut out and the other person is acting all weird and doesn't want them to meet their family.
She's just never been like that before.
So, they're dorky. I feel like... it's something more. She's different.
(blows it off) I don't know. I'm over reacty. Pay me no mind. People in love are always a little crazy.
Is that Tara?
I guess not. Thought I heard something.
Tara, what...
What you are?
Tara, you're not... how could you not say something to me... to <b>me</b>...
Wait! Go? She just did a spell that went wrong! Buffy, it was just a mistake!
Tara, look at me. (she does) I trusted you more than anyone in my life. Was all of that a lie?
Do you want to leave?
I know that. (to Tara) Do you want to leave?
(pissed) Hey! (gets it) Hey!
And it hurt! I mean, him!
(smiling) You're not a demon.
My dance.
Good birthday?
I still can't believe you never told me about your family and all that.
See? That's where you're a dummy. I think about what you grew up with, and then look at what you are... it makes me proud. It makes me love you more.
Magic.
