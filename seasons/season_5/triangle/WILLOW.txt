Good. And... and the hellebore. It's up and to the right.
I'll fix it! I'll fix it!
Recursat!
Look. All back. (lying) Good as new.
(to Xander)  Well, can you even believe how she's  acting?
I'm not--
(to Anya) You made him mad.
Fleabane.
Salamander eyes.
Okay. Here we go.
Shh. Spirits of light, grant my wishes--
Are you trying to screw this up?
No, you haven't. Come on...
Let it out!
He's not a ball of sunshine.
I don't even get how we made that guy anyway, because wow, advanced.
You don't know how to drive?! Why  didn't you say you don't know how to  drive? "I don't know how to drive,"  you might have said.
What?
Nothing.
Noooo! (then, softly) That's gone.
I wish Buffy was here.
I wish for a million dollars. (off Xander's look) Just checking.
Not me! We! I mean us. Her! It's very complex.
(reads) Let the conjuring be--
No one lets me finish.
(reads very quickly)  And keep him far from us and ours as  long as my voice shall sound.
Okay, wait... (skimming) Let the conjuring... that's right--
Gone.
You got the earlier flight! Yay.
You can yell at us or go help Buffy rescue the innocent.
I understand it's difficult.
Oh, he's snapped.
Hurry up! (re: books)  I'm taking everything with relocation  spells, suspension spells... and, what the heck, spells to make him really sleepy, because, slightly better.
I didn't-- Why do you do that?
Oh, look for spells about dimensional  portals, too.
Xander's my best friend!
Did he say...
Xander!
(in Latin) Let the monster disappear.
Damn!
Anya, listen. I have faith in you. There is <u>no one</u> you cannot piss off.
(softly, in Latin)  Tool of vengeance, weapon mythic,  arise, arise, defy the earth...
(in Latin) Fly with force, deny thy master. Fly!
You too. Very irritating.
(to Xander and Anya)  She's got him now.
It's hard to be precise, though. Alternate universes don't stay put. Sending him to a specific place is  like, like trying to hit a puppy by  throwing a live bee at it. Which is  a weird image and you should all just forget it.
He's prob'ly in Troll-land.
