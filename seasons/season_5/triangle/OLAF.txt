ARRRRRR!
HA HA! PUNY RECEPTACLE!
YOU DO WELL TO FLEE, TOWNSPEOPLE! I WILL PILLAGE YOUR LANDS AND DWELLINGS. I WILL BURN YOUR CROPS, AND MAKE MERRY SPORT WITH YOUR MORE ATTRACTIVE DAUGHTERS, MARK MY WORDS-- (smelling something) OOH! ALE! I SMELL DELICIOUS ALE!
(happily) ALE!
YES! FRAGRANT ALE! I HAVE BEEN  TRAPPED FOR MANY CENTURIES AND ALONG  WITH MY TASTE OF FREEDOM I WOULD  APPRECIATE THE TASTE OF A FINE GRAIN- BASED BEVERAGE!
BARMAID! FETCH ME STRONGER ALE! AND SOME PLUMP SUCCULENT BABIES TO EAT!
I FIND MYSELF VERY HUNGRY AND WHEN I  AM HUNGRY I GET SHORT OF PATIENCE!
YOU CANNOT APPEASE ME! DO NOT TRY!
MORE ALE!
(bellows even louder) STOP!
I DID NOT CHEAT! NOT IN MY HEART. (to Buffy) IT WAS ONLY ONE WENCH AND I HAD HAD  A GREAT DEAL OF MEAD-- NEXT THING I  KNOW, I'M A TROLL! CURSE YOU,  ANYANKA! YOU WILL DIE FOR THIS!
WITCH! YOU MUST STOP!
HA! IT DID NOT WORK!
I WILL GET AWAY FROM THEM AFTER I KILL THEM!
AH. YOU WISH FOR MORE! ADMIRABLE!
HA HA! YOU FIGHT WELL, ALTHOUGH YOU ARE A TINY MAN!
I SHALL REWARD YOU! ONLY ONE OF YOUR WOMEN SHALL DIE! AND YOU SHALL BE THE ONE TO CHOOSE!
THEN YOU SHALL BE THE ONE TO DIE!
WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR, MINISCULE BLONDE ONE? YOUR FRIENDS? THESE TWO?
THEY WILL NEVER LAST. ANYANKA IS  VERY DIFFICULT TO LIVE WITH, AND HE,  HE IS LUDICROUS AND FAR TOO  BREAKABLE. THEIR LOVE WILL NEVER  LAST.
