ANYA: Nope.
XANDER: Check. Big bomb clock.
ANYA: Okay.
XANDER: By the way, I'm not going to want to go.
XANDER: C' mere.
ANYA: Maybe it's her.
XANDER: Huh?
NUN: What... what was that? He looked  like, like a demon?
BUFFY: Yes, he did. Are you okay?
NUN: I think so.
NUN: Um... good.
NUN: Well, uh...
GILES: Now switch. Right lead.
GILES: Saw that coming. You dropped your  shoulder. The resources that the  Watcher's Council has at its  disposal... I mean, the central  library alone...
GILES: You're still dropping your shoulder,  I know you're going to go with your  right. You're doing it again.
GILES: (slightly shaky) Yes... terrific.
BUFFY: Answer me.
BUFFY: I know, it's just that I trust those Watchers about at far as… (noting Giles' arm rubbing) …<u>you</u> could throw them.
BUFFY: It's okay. You can say his name.
BUFFY: I'm doing all right. I mean, these  things happen. People break up, they  move on. For a while it feels like  the end of the world, but in the big picture...
ANYA: Well, I get to run the store, right?
ANYA: I can take care of that.
TARA: I'm envious, Giles. A trip to England sounds so exciting and exotic. (realizing)  Unless you're English.
XANDER: Yeah, Anya can do it.
ANYA: Thank you, Sweetie. Well said.
XANDER: There, see? She'll be great.
GILES: Perhaps I should call the airline… 
ANYA: (to Xander) Well tell her I don't need her help!
XANDER: (to Buffy) Hey, how goes the slaying?
XANDER: Okay, now we're back to frightening.
BUFFY: You, with the actual clothing. Who are you? (calls out) Dawn! Come look at this!
JOYCE: Hard to recognize me, huh?
BUFFY: No more bathrobe.
DAWN: Whoa.
JOYCE: I looked at it today and there it was, all fuzzy and, and, blue, and… I couldn't stand it anymore.
DAWN: It was getting a little ripe, Mom.
BUFFY: Maybe we should burn it.
DAWN: It would keep the bugs away.
BUFFY: (to Dawn) Come on, she's tired out.
DAWN: Whatcha doing?
BUFFY: Playing soccer.
DAWN: Can I hang out in here?
BUFFY: Don't touch anything.
DAWN: You took down his pictures.
BUFFY: Yeah.
BUFFY: It didn't feel like that. I was never angry with him. (then) Okay, that's a lie. I was angry with him, but… not like I didn't want to see his face.
DAWN: I was just starting to kinda like the  guy and then... gone. So fast.
DAWN: Oh. (beat) Does that make it better?
BUFFY: No.
DAWN: It'll get better. Won't it?
BUFFY: I hope so. I mean, yeah. It has to. I'll just keep going on like I am,  and it'll get better. Every day  it'll be a tiny bit better.
DAWN: Every day?
BUFFY: Not really. But it'll be better soon.
SPIKE: Pretty state you'd be in, thinking  things are all right while he's  toddling halfway round the bend.  Oh, I'll insult him if I want to!  I'm the one on your side! Me! Doing  you a favor! And you being dead  petty about it. Me getting nothing  but your hatred and venom and...!
SPIKE: Ungrateful bitch--
SPIKE: Buffy. Yeah. Something I wanted to  tell you...
WILLOW: Good. And... and the hellebore. It's up and to the right.
TARA: Hellebore. One of my favorites.
ANYA: Hey! What are you two doing?
TARA: Willow, maybe we should just pay--
ANYA: Stop that!
XANDER: (joking)  Bet you're sorry you said anything,  huh, Tara?
ANYA: The cash register! What did you do  with the cash register?! Dear God!
WILLOW: I'll fix it! I'll fix it!
WILLOW: Recursat!
WILLOW: Look. All back. (lying) Good as new.
ANYA: (to Willow) You endangered the money!
WILLOW: (to Xander)  Well, can you even believe how she's  acting?
XANDER: Okay, you know what? I'm tired of  being the one in the middle. I'm not  going to let you pull me into this.
WILLOW: I'm not--
ANYA: Xander! Don't go!
WILLOW: (to Anya) You made him mad.
ANYA: Me?!
WILLOW: Fleabane.
WILLOW: Salamander eyes.
ANYA: Ten bucks for twelve. Bargain.
ANYA: Oh, that's a pricey one--
ANYA: Fine.
WILLOW: Okay. Here we go.
ANYA: Is it done?
WILLOW: Shh. Spirits of light, grant my wishes--
ANYA: Sorry. Thought it was done.
WILLOW: Are you trying to screw this up?
ANYA: No, no. I'm sure you can do that all on your own.
ANYA: I believe I have said it.
WILLOW: No, you haven't. Come on...
WILLOW: Let it out!
OLAF: ARRRRRR!
WILLOW: He's not a ball of sunshine.
TARA: That was just, you know, enthusiasm.
BUFFY: It seemed very much like saliva.
TARA: We'll sit farther back next time.
TARA: Oh. I'm sorry. Is it that bad?
BUFFY: Anya and Xander are in trouble?
BUFFY: He left? He left Anya?
TARA: Um… no. Not left her, left her. He just left. It was only a little thing. Really.
BUFFY: Nooo!
TARA: Oh dear.
TARA: I think...
BUFFY: (almost wailing) They have a... a... beautiful love!
TARA: I think they'll be fine...
BUFFY: Mmrccllvv.
TARA: What?
BUFFY: A miraculous lo-- lo-- love!
WILLOW: I don't even get how we made that guy anyway, because wow, advanced.
ANYA: I don't know how to put the top up. I only just figured out what the left pedal does. (proudly)  It makes us stop.
WILLOW: You don't know how to drive?! Why  didn't you say you don't know how to  drive? "I don't know how to drive,"  you might have said.
ANYA: Well, I couldn't know if I could until  I tried, could I?  WILLOW  This is very very bad! There's an ogre on the loose and--
ANYA: Troll.
WILLOW: What?
ANYA: It's likely. We're going very fast. (then) You should have listened to me and not done a spell. Giles left me in charge.
ANYA: What do you mean by that?
WILLOW: Nothing.
ANYA: Find that spell. Quickly.
WILLOW: Noooo! (then, softly) That's gone.
SPIKE: I was here first, you know.
SPIKE: They've got chicken wings too. Also  a sort of a flower-shaped thing they  make from an onion. Brilliant.
XANDER: What? No. Nothing to do with Buffy.
BUFFY: Don't worry. We'll get her back. I promise. (then)  C'mon, this thing's probably leaving  a huge trail.
OLAF: HA HA! PUNY RECEPTACLE!
OLAF: YOU DO WELL TO FLEE, TOWNSPEOPLE! I WILL PILLAGE YOUR LANDS AND DWELLINGS. I WILL BURN YOUR CROPS, AND MAKE MERRY SPORT WITH YOUR MORE ATTRACTIVE DAUGHTERS, MARK MY WORDS-- (smelling something) OOH! ALE! I SMELL DELICIOUS ALE!
XANDER: What?
SPIKE: I mean, did she want to be made a fool of?! And what does someone have to do to make it right? --
SPIKE: Hey! Watch it, mate!
SPIKE: Second thought, do what you like.
OLAF: (happily) ALE!
OLAF: YES! FRAGRANT ALE! I HAVE BEEN  TRAPPED FOR MANY CENTURIES AND ALONG  WITH MY TASTE OF FREEDOM I WOULD  APPRECIATE THE TASTE OF A FINE GRAIN- BASED BEVERAGE!
XANDER: So, um… think I should run get Buffy?
OLAF: BARMAID! FETCH ME STRONGER ALE! AND SOME PLUMP SUCCULENT BABIES TO EAT!
XANDER: I'm gonna run get Buffy. (realizing) Or you can fight him!
SPIKE: Yeah, I could do that but I'm paralyzed with not caring very much.
SPIKE: (to Xander)  What do you think? The hospital, maybe?
XANDER: (to Spike) What? Shut up! (to Olaf)  Um... listen...
OLAF: I FIND MYSELF VERY HUNGRY AND WHEN I  AM HUNGRY I GET SHORT OF PATIENCE!
XANDER: (soothingly)  Hey, we can take care of hungry. How  'bout you just sit down, on one of  the sturdier chairs, and we can talk  calmly and have some food.
SPIKE: They have this onion thing--
OLAF: YOU CANNOT APPEASE ME! DO NOT TRY!
OLAF: MORE ALE!
WILLOW: I wish Buffy was here.
BUFFY: I'm here.
WILLOW: I wish for a million dollars. (off Xander's look) Just checking.
TARA: (to Willow) I'm so glad you're okay.
BUFFY: (to Willow)  You did this?
WILLOW: Not me! We! I mean us. Her! It's very complex.
ANYA: But we can stop him. Willow, do the spell.
WILLOW: (reads) Let the conjuring be--
OLAF: (bellows even louder) STOP!
WILLOW: No one lets me finish.
ANYA: Hum.
TARA: We're forgetting about the troll. Let's pay attention to the troll.
OLAF: I DID NOT CHEAT! NOT IN MY HEART. (to Buffy) IT WAS ONLY ONE WENCH AND I HAD HAD  A GREAT DEAL OF MEAD-- NEXT THING I  KNOW, I'M A TROLL! CURSE YOU,  ANYANKA! YOU WILL DIE FOR THIS!
OLAF: WITCH! YOU MUST STOP!
WILLOW: (reads very quickly)  And keep him far from us and ours as  long as my voice shall sound.
OLAF: HA! IT DID NOT WORK!
WILLOW: Okay, wait... (skimming) Let the conjuring... that's right--
ANYA: The hammer! Watch out!
ANYA: The hammer is his power.
WILLOW: Gone.
BUFFY: Xander, follow him. Willow and Anya, head back to the store, try to come up with a spell that'll actually stop him.
SPIKE: I got someone here. Help me get 'er out.
ANYA: This is a terrible mess.
WILLOW: You got the earlier flight! Yay.
GILES: (still smiling) The damage. Was it a demon?
GILES: A troll. Fine. I'm going to… going to… do something!
WILLOW: You can yell at us or go help Buffy rescue the innocent.
WILLOW: I understand it's difficult.
GILES: I will rescue the innocent!
ANYA: The keys of your car.
GILES: Fabulous!
WILLOW: Oh, he's snapped.
TARA: Got her!
SPIKE: (to himself)  What does it take?
WILLOW: Hurry up! (re: books)  I'm taking everything with relocation  spells, suspension spells... and, what the heck, spells to make him really sleepy, because, slightly better.
ANYA: In case we need 'em, I'm getting more of all the things you stole.
WILLOW: I didn't-- Why do you do that?
ANYA: What?
WILLOW: Oh, look for spells about dimensional  portals, too.
ANYA: I am a human. And there are many humans who are stranger than me.
ANYA: (realizing)  You really think I would do that!
ANYA: I was a demon then. I don't even have any powers now! (re: book) Is this the spell?
WILLOW: Xander's my best friend!
ANYA: Why not?
XANDER: No! Get away from them!
OLAF: I WILL GET AWAY FROM THEM AFTER I KILL THEM!
XANDER: (dangerously) <u>You are not touching these women</u>!
OLAF: AH. YOU WISH FOR MORE! ADMIRABLE!
OLAF: HA HA! YOU FIGHT WELL, ALTHOUGH YOU ARE A TINY MAN!
OLAF: I SHALL REWARD YOU! ONLY ONE OF YOUR WOMEN SHALL DIE! AND YOU SHALL BE THE ONE TO CHOOSE!
WILLOW: Did he say...
ANYA: Go Xander! I love you!
WILLOW: Xander!
XANDER: (through his pain) I won't choose!
OLAF: THEN YOU SHALL BE THE ONE TO DIE!
ANYA: Don't take Xander!
WILLOW: (in Latin) Let the monster disappear.
WILLOW: Damn!
ANYA: Buffy!
ANYA: I don't know how!
WILLOW: Anya, listen. I have faith in you. There is <u>no one</u> you cannot piss off.
ANYA: Hey! Olaf! You are as inadequate a troll as you were a boyfriend!
ANYA: You are hairy and unattractive and  even women trolls are put off by your  various odors!
WILLOW: (softly, in Latin)  Tool of vengeance, weapon mythic,  arise, arise, defy the earth...
WILLOW: (in Latin) Fly with force, deny thy master. Fly!
ANYA: Hey! Good job!
WILLOW: You too. Very irritating.
BUFFY: (triumphantly) So. Your power's in your hammer.
ANYA: Oh yeah. He still has all that troll-strength.
DISPENSE: NO MERCY NOW!
OLAF: WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR, MINISCULE BLONDE ONE? YOUR FRIENDS? THESE TWO?
OLAF: THEY WILL NEVER LAST. ANYANKA IS  VERY DIFFICULT TO LIVE WITH, AND HE,  HE IS LUDICROUS AND FAR TOO  BREAKABLE. THEIR LOVE WILL NEVER  LAST.
WILLOW: (to Xander and Anya)  She's got him now.
ANYA: (to Xander) Poor baby.
XANDER: You really dated him?
ANYA: Yes.
XANDER: But you like me better.
ANYA: Yes. Willow likes you too, but not in a sexy way 'cuz she's gay, and she won't break us up so it's all okay.
GILES: Where did you send him?
ANYA: The Land of the Trolls. He'll like it there. Full of trolls.
WILLOW: It's hard to be precise, though. Alternate universes don't stay put. Sending him to a specific place is  like, like trying to hit a puppy by  throwing a live bee at it. Which is  a weird image and you should all just forget it.
ANYA: It's possible that he's in the Land of Perpetual Wednesday or Crazy Melty Land or the World Without Shrimp.
WILLOW: He's prob'ly in Troll-land.
BUFFY: I only care that he's not here and I got a nifty new souvenir.
BUFFY: Oops.
BUFFY: (looking at Willow and Tara)  So together... and good... and alive...
BUFFY: I'm just so... happy for you!
GILES: Where's the cash register?
GILES: Yes-- (to Joyce) You know all of this?
JOYCE: I got some of it myself. Buffy told me the rest.
GILES: No.
GILES: It is disorienting.
JOYCE: Well, I can't think about this any more. It's too-- (then, re: cups)  I'll get these.
