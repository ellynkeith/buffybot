This is... this is terrible! I'll never be able to mend this!
Oh yes, inappropriate humor. Most amusing. (indicating dress) I don't suppose you know what lead  to this sartorial tragedy?
Yes, yes, of course. I just thought  maybe after her Magnificent  Incandescence was returned to this  manly and painfully handsome  assemblage, you might have observed  something interesting? A Key in  human form perhaps? Lounging  about, unattended?
Why do you insist on fighting the  inevitable? No one can stand against  her blindingly Scrumptious Luminescence --
With all due respect and fear of sharp  objects, you exist, sir, only because  of her divine greatness.
I wanted to be an underwear model. (shrugs) We play the hand we're dealt.
The flattering drawstring pants?
Drugs, sir?
True, this oh so appealing form - (indicates Ben's body) --will by necessity be shrugged off --
And if you did? What then?
The signs are in alignment. Soon victory will be in our grasp. All we need do is seize the moment... and squeeze until it bleeds.
