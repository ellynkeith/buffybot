BUFFY: Run!
GLORY: You're really starting to piss me off, witch.
WILLOW: (Russian) Air becomes FIST!
DAWN: (gasping) Wait... Buffy...
BUFFY: We have to keep moving!
DAWN: (gasping) I... I can't ...
GLORY: I really hate it when people touch my things.
BUFFY: Just one. (a beat) Truck.
GLORY: No! Not now, you idiot! Let... go... of my...
BEN: ... BODY!
BEN: Oh godů
XANDER: Go, Buff!
GILES: I knew you'd be able best Glory  eventually. With all our years of  training and --
BUFFY: (not turning around) A truck hit her.
GILES: Oh.
ANYA: (encouraging) Did you throw it?
DAWN: Well, no, she more kind of waited  for it to hit Glory -- but then Buffy  ran really fast and we got away!
BUFFY: I don't know how we got away.  That truck couldn't have slowed  her down for more than a second.
GILES: How isn't important. All that matters is the two of you are safe.
BUFFY: Safe? We've barely been able to  manage not getting seriously dead  every time we cross paths with Glory.  Now that she knows about Dawn ...
TARA: Floaty green shimmers.
WILLOW: She didn't mean to. You know that, right?
BUFFY: I know. But it's done, and now we have to deal with it.
GILES: Perhaps there's something in the Book  of Tarnis, something we've missed  that we can use against Glory.
ANYA: Piano!
XANDER: Right. Piano. Because that's what we used to kill that big demon that  one time. No, wait. That was a  rocket launcher. Ahn, what are you talkin'?
ANYA: We should drop a piano on her. (off their looks) It always works for that creepy  cartoon rabbit when he's running  from that nice man with the  speech impediment.
GILES: Yes, or perhaps we could paint a  convincing fake tunnel on the side  of a mountain. Let's keep thinking.  We should reassemble at the shop,  see what we can --
BUFFY: We can't fight her.
GILES: Not yet, but --
BUFFY: Not ever. She's too strong, Giles.  We're not going to win this with  spells or stakes or yanking out  uranium power cores. She's a god,  and she's coming for us. So let's  not be here when she starts knocking.
ANYA: Run away?! Finally a sensible plan.
XANDER: That's not what she meant.  (to Buffy, uncertain)  Is it?
BUFFY: (increasingly frazzled) We can't stay here. Glory will kill us  off one by one until there's nobody  standing between her and Dawn.
GILES: Buffy, we all understand the severity  of the situation, but there must be another --
BUFFY: (on the edge) No! We stay -- we die! Show of hands for that option?
DAWN: (rattled, trying not to show it) Cool. Won't have to study for that geometry test.
XANDER: What about wheels? I don't think  everybody's gonna fit in the Xan-mobile.
BUFFY: Just get your stuff together. I'll take care of it.
GRONX: This is... this is terrible! I'll never be able to mend this!
BEN: Not really my color anyway.
GRONX: Oh yes, inappropriate humor. Most amusing. (indicating dress) I don't suppose you know what lead  to this sartorial tragedy?
BEN: That's not how it works. You know that.
GRONX: Yes, yes, of course. I just thought  maybe after her Magnificent  Incandescence was returned to this  manly and painfully handsome  assemblage, you might have observed  something interesting? A Key in  human form perhaps? Lounging  about, unattended?
BEN: If I did, do you really think I would tell you?
GRONX: Why do you insist on fighting the  inevitable? No one can stand against  her blindingly Scrumptious Luminescence --
BEN: Glory! Her name is Glory. And she's your god, you little scab. Not mine.
GRONX: With all due respect and fear of sharp  objects, you exist, sir, only because  of her divine greatness.
BEN: You mean her divine failure, don't you?
GRONX: I wanted to be an underwear model. (shrugs) We play the hand we're dealt.
BEN: Nothing's mine, is it? This body,  this life. It's all infected. The only  thing I've ever cared about she's  taken away from me.
GRONX: The flattering drawstring pants?
BEN: To be close to people. To witness  their lives and their deaths. To be  there, alongside them, a part of  everyday humanity. (laughs bitterly) Or maybe it was the drugs.
GRONX: Drugs, sir?
BEN: Find the right combination... keep her buried where she belongs --
BEN: Oh yeah, I'm thrilled. Especially with  the part where she gets her Key back  and I cease to exist.
GRONX: True, this oh so appealing form - (indicates Ben's body) --will by necessity be shrugged off --
BEN: Not if I get to the Key first.
GRONX: And if you did? What then?
BEN: It doesn't matter how I came by it. It's mine.
ANYA: Anybody else feel that?
WILLOW: What?
ANYA: Cold draft of paralyzing fear.
GILES: We just need to stay calm.
WILLOW: (scared) Calm. Right.
XANDER: We gotta be Sergeant Rock! Cool and collected in the face of overwhelming odds.
ANYA: (not liking the sound of that) <u>Over</u>whelming? How much more than whelming would that be exactly?
GILES: What's he doing here?
SPIKE: (dryly) Just out for a jaunt. Thought I'd swing by and say howdy.
GILES: Out.
BUFFY: He's here because we need him.
XANDER: The hell we do.
BUFFY: If Glory finds us, he's the only one  besides me that has a chance of  protecting Dawn.
XANDER: Buffy, come on, he --
BUFFY: This isn't a discussion! He stays. Get over it.
SPIKE: Buckle up, kids! Daddy's puttin' the hammer down.
NURSE: Sign here.
DANTE: (softly, to Knight #1) See? Did I not tell you it would be easy to --
NURSE: My pen?
ORLANDO: The trees are singing water.
DANTE: Yes, General.
GREGOR: Welcome home, Orlando. (embraces him) I swear by my sword, your sacrifice will not go unavenged.
ORLANDO: (re: armor) Shiny.
GREGOR: Yes. I suppose it is.
ORLANDO: Pretty little girl. She's shiny too.
GREGOR: (to Dante) Watch him. Make sure he's... comfortable.
ORLANDO: All shiny. Pretty little Key.
GREGOR: The Key? You've seen it?!
ORLANDO: Pretty little shiny girl...
GREGOR: (spitting it out) The monks. They've made it human.
DANTE: We know the Slayer is protecting the Key. If what Orlando says is true ...
GREGOR: Prepare to advance!
ANYA: Shouldn't somebody be asking if we're  there yet? That's what small irritating  children do, don't they?
DAWN: That kinda only works if you know where you're going.
ANYA: Oh. (a beat, loudly) Do we know where we're going yet?!
SPIKE: Already be somewhere if Captain Slowpoke would give up the wheel. (to Giles) Hey, gramps! Bloody step on it!
GILES: Step on what? I've driven tricycles with more power.
XANDER: Anybody else a little queasy?
ANYA: (to Gang, re: Xander) He doesn't travel well. He's like fine shrimp.
SPIKE: Should've nicked that Porsche I had  me eye on. Just enough room for me,  you, and big sis.
XANDER: Just give it a rest or --
SPIKE: Or what? Gonna toss your cookies on my shoes?
XANDER: --or you're going to be Undead Man  <u>Walking</u>. See how fast you hitch a  ride with a flaming thumb.
SPIKE: Fine... (soft) ... shrimp.
XANDER: That guy is bloodsucking the last nerve right out of me.
GILES: Buffy does have a point. In a confrontation,  Spike could prove... (paining him) ... useful.
XANDER: I don't know if Buffy's thinking too  clear on that one. Or anything else  right now. I've never seen her so..
GILES: She's had more than her share to deal  with of late. She just needs a chance  to catch her breath. Regroup. (trying to convince himself) She'll be all right.
XANDER: Yeah, she'll... (weakly) Yeah.
DAWN: Any luck?
WILLOW: If you define luck as the absence of success -- plenty.
TARA: (to Willow, re: Dawn) It's so pretty. Can I have one?
DAWN: Umm... Anybody hungry?
ANYA: (leaping up) Ouhh! Snacks!
SPIKE: Hey!
WILLOW: Tara, no!
DAWN: (gently) We know.
SPIKE: Yeah, no biggie. Look, skin's already  stopped smoking. You go ahead and  play peek-a-boo with Mr. Sunshine  all you want. Keep the ride from getting boring.
TARA: All the light... gone.
WILLOW: No, baby. It's still light outside. Shh ...
TARA: ...dark....... all dark ...
CRAZIES: (soft, whispered) Soon... soon
GRONX: The signs are in alignment. Soon victory will be in our grasp. All we need do is seize the moment... and squeeze until it bleeds.
DAWN: Hey. I think Anya's gonna try to cook.  Wanna come watch the tears and recriminations?
BUFFY: Maybe later.
DAWN: Thank you.
BUFFY: For what?
DAWN: You know. Pretty much... everything.
BUFFY: (down on her herself) Yeah. I'm doing a great job.
DAWN: You are.
BUFFY: I'm the Slayer. The Chosen one, all  mythic and defendery. Evil Nasties  are supposed to flee from me, not the  other way around.
DAWN: You're not fleeing. You're... moving at a brisk pace.
BUFFY: Quaintly referred to in some cultures as the Big Scaredy Run Away.
DAWN: (sincerely) It's the most amazing thing anyone's ever done for me.
BUFFY: It just... keeps coming. Glory. Riley. Tara. Mom --
DAWN: (soft) I know. (a beat) But there's a bright side.
BUFFY: There is?
DAWN: Yeah. At least things can't get any crazier, right?
BUFFY: (to Dawn) You know this is your fault for saying that.
BUFFY: Giles!
GILES: I see them!
SPIKE: See who?
XANDER: Arrows! They're throwing arrows!
BUFFY: Dawn! Stay down!
TARA: Horsies!
WILLOW: Tara!
GILES: (calling to Gang) Weapons?!
SPIKE: Hello! You're driving one!
WILLOW: Don't hurt the horsies!
BUFFY: We won't. (to Giles, whispered) Aim for the horsies.
XANDER: (trying not to vomit) Did we shake 'em?
BUFFY: Stay low! Watch out for --
SPIKE: (to Buffy) Now might be a good time for something heroic.
BUFFY: Xander! Hatch!
DAWN: Keep the pressure on.
SPIKE: Always do, sweet bit.
ANYA: (re: frying pan). Not a piano, but hey.
GILES: Everyone all right?
BUFFY: (to Willow, re: Giles) Willow...?
WILLOW: I'm on it.
BUFFY: You sure you're all right?
DAWN: Yeah. But Spike's hurt.
SPIKE: Ow! Easy with the delicates!
BUFFY: (to Dawn) They'll heal.
SPIKE: (grumbling) Florence Nightingale to the bloody rescue.
ANYA: We have another plan, right? One that  doesn't involve pointy arrows and Winnebagos?
BUFFY: We'll -- we'll rest here for a minute.  Then we have to keep moving.
XANDER: Where?
BUFFY: (snapping at him) I don't know! But we can't stay here. It's too close to the wreck, too easy to --
WILLOW: Buffy?
BUFFY: How is he?
WILLOW: I think I slowed the bleeding, but ...
BUFFY: Okay. Okay, just... just let me think --
XANDER: We got company -- and they brought a Crusade!
BUFFY: Willow!
WILLOW: I'm working on it!
BUFFY: Dawn --
DAWN: Buffy!
GREGOR: The Key!
WILLOW: Enemies, fly and fall...circling arms, raise a wall!
DANTE: They have the General. Clerics!
DANTE: Can it be breached?
XANDER: (indicating Will's nose) Will.
WILLOW: (re: nose bleed) You get used to it.
BUFFY: How long will it hold?
WILLOW: Half a day, maybe.
SPIKE: What's the story on these roleplaying rejects?
BUFFY: Let's find out.
SPIKE: You sure Scarface here can habla the English?
GREGOR: You were warned we would return, Slayer.
BUFFY: Took you long enough. (eyeing his larger tattoo) You supposed to be some kind of chief?
GREGOR: General.
BUFPY: (staring him down) In charge of what? Getting captured?
GREGOR: You do not frighten me, child.
GREGOR: The instrument of chaos will be destroyed --
BUFFY: Look at her that way again, and she'll be the last thing you ever see.
GREGOR: (not backing down) As I was told. You protect the Key of the Beast.
BUFFY: It's not that simple.
GREGOR: Yes. The Key has been transformed.  Given breath. Life. (sadly, to Buffy) Yet this makes no difference. The  Key is the link. The link must be  severed. Such <u>is</u> the will of God.
BUFFY: She doesn't remember anything about  being this Key everyone's looking for!  All she remembers is growing up with  a mother and a sister that love her.  What kind of god would demand her  life for something she has no control over?
GREGOR: (a beat) No.
BUFFY: (losing it again) It's not her fault! She's human now!
GREGOR: The Key is too dangerous to be allowed  to exist -- no matter what form it has  been pressed into.
BUFFY: (on the verge of violence) I'm not going to let anyone --
WILLOW: Tara... Tara, please ...
BUFFY: What happened?
ANYA: I don't know! She just went nuts! (whoops) Oh! I mean, uh --
TARA: (screaming) Time! Time! Time!
WILLOW: We have to do something. She can't stay like this. Buffy?
TARA: (crying softly) Time... time...
CRAZIES: ...time... ...timeů
NURSE: No, it's not time for your meds yet. Just lie back and--
CRAZIES: (muttering softly) ...time... it's time... it's time...
ORLANDO: It's time! It's time!
DANTE: No! Shhh... There's nothing to fear,  my brother. The Beast may have taken  your mind, but I swear to you... she  will never know the taste of your heart.
BUFFY: I'm sorry.
GILES: For what?
BUFFY: We should have stayed. If we had, none of this --
GILES: Don't. (a beat) You did... what was necessary. What I've always admired.
BUFFY: Running away?
GILES: Being able to place your heart  above all else. (a beat) I'm so proud of you. How far you've  come. You're everything a Watcher - everything I could have hoped for ...
BUFFY: Willow. Open a door.
DANTE: Speak.
BUFFY: One of my friends was hurt when you attacked us --
DANTE: And ten of mine are dead. Honorable men. Shall we balance the scale?
BUFFY: Will you let someone come and help him or not?
DANTE: Give quarter to an agent of the Beast?  What madness would move me to  such action?
BUFFY: I'm done asking.
XANDER: Whoa, hey, uh... this is war, isn't it?  And if there's one thing I've learned  from Sergeant Rock, in war there are  rules. Or at least there should be...  if you're as "honorable" as you think you are. (a beat) Plus we do have your General Forehead Guy.
WILLOW: ... discharge and bring life!
SPIKE: (re: Willow) Handier than a Swiss knife. You know  the door to my crypt's got this nasty  squeak. Maybe you could --
BUFFY: (into phone) Hey, it's Buffy. I need to ask you a really big favor ...
BEN: You, uh, forgot to mention the costume party outside.
BUFFY: Sorry. I -- I didn't know who else to call.
BEN: No, it's okay. I mean, yeah, not exactly  the way I pictured seeing you again, but -- (laughs) I'll take what I can get.
BUFFY: Thanks for coming.
BEN: My pleasure.
BEN: I think I got him stabilized, but there's  a lot of damage. We need to get him out of here.
BUFFY: The guys with the pointy swords kinda have other ideas.
BEN: (facetiously) Don't they always?
BUFFY: I know this must seem extra outer limits --
BEN: This? Nah. I've seen things you  wouldn't believe. You know, emergency  room, full moon on a Saturday night ...
BUFFY: If things get too weird, just let me know. I'll understand.
BEN: (smiling warmly) Don t worry about me. I won't leave till I've worn out my welcome.
SPIKE: (lighting cig) Thanks.
XANDER: You know those things'll kill you.
SPIKE: Might have slipped it in once or twice.
XANDER: (re: Spike's hands) How are the feelers?
SPIKE: (grimacing in pain) Nothing compared to the little bits  we're all going to get chopped into  when the Renaissance Fair kicks the  door in. And here we bloody sit.
XANDER: Not like we have much of a choice.
SPIKE: Could make a run for it. Use General  Armor-All as a shield, get to the doc's  car and --
XANDER: Great plan. And while all the hacking  and slashing's going on, what are you  going to be doing? Throwing migraines at 'em?
SPIKE: Look, we stay here, we all die. At least this way some of us might --
BUFFY: No.
BUFFY: We're all going to make it. I'm not losing anyone.
GREGOR: Dissension in the ranks. Seldom the harbinger of glad tidings.
BUFFY: Shut up!
GREGOR: Poor, frightened girl. You've no idea what you've gotten yourself into.
BUFFY: Then why don't you fill me in?
GREGOR: Would it make a difference?
BUFFY: Strong. Fast. Hellgod.
GREGOR: From a dimension of unspeakable torment.
BUFFY: A demon dimension, I know. There  were two other Hellgods that ruled  with her, weren't there?
GREGOR: Along with the Beast, they were a  triumvirate of suffering and despair,  ruling with equal vengeance. But the  power of the Beast grew beyond even  what they could conceive -- as did her  lust for pain and misery. They looked  upon her, what she had become... and trembled.
BUFFY: A god afraid?
GREGOR: Such was her power. They feared  she would attempt to seize the dimension  for herself, and decided to strike first.  A great battle erupted. The very bowels  of Hell trembled as the war of the gods  spanned a thousand years. In the end,  they stood victorious over the Beast -  barely. She was cast out, banished  to this "lower" plane of existence, forced  to live and ultimately die trapped within  the body of a mortal, a newborn male,  created as her prison. Her own living Hell.
BUFFY: Wait -- <u>male</u>?
GREGOR: That was her punishment. To finish  an ageless existence buried deep inside  the flesh tomb of a normal average  human man. A man that would grow,  age, and eventually die, like all the  rest of us. That is the Beast's only weakness.
BUFFY: (getting it) Kill the man, and the god dies.
GREGOR: (nods) Unfortunately the identity of the  human vessel has never been discovered.
BUFFY: I don't understand. I've seen Glory.  Not a whole lot going on in the hairy  chest department.
GREGOR: You have seen a glimpse of the true  Beast. Her power was too great to be  completely contained. She's found  a way to escape her mortal prison for  brief periods before her energies are  exhausted and she's forced back into  her living cell of meat and bone.
DAWN: What about the Key?
BUFFY: Dawn - -
DAWN: (scared but determined) I want to know.
GREGOR: The Key is almost as old as the Beast  itself. Where it came from, how it  was created -- the deepest of mysteries.  All that is certain is that its power is absolute. Countless generations of my people  have sacrificed their lives in search  of it, to destroy it before its wrath  could be unleashed.
DAWN: But the monks found it first.
GREGOR: (bitterly) Yes. And hid it with their magicks.
BUFFY: Why didn't they destroy it? If the Key's as dangerous as you --
GREGOR: Because they were fools! They thought  they could harness its power for the  forces of light. They failed -- and  paid with their blood.
DAWN: What do I do? What was I created for?
GREGOR: You were created to open the gates  that separate dimensions. The Beast  will use your power to return home  and seize control of the Hell she  was banished from.
BUFFY: That's it? That's Glory's master plan?  Go home?
GREGOR: You misunderstand. When the Key is  activated, it won't just open a gate  to the Beast's dimension -- it's going  to open <u>all</u> the gates. The walls  separating realities will crumble.  Dimensions will bleed into one another.  Order will be overthrown and the  universe will tumble into chaos.  All dark. Forever. (to Dawn) That is what you were created for.
BUFFY: Dawn...
DAWN: (soft) You think it's true? What he said?
BUFFY: I don't know.
DAWN: (trying not to cry)  Destroyer of the universe. Guess cutting  school doesn't seem so bad now, huh? 
BUFFY: It's not you. You know that.
DAWN: But it's in me, isn't it? It's inside me. (a beat, small) What are we going to do?
BUFFY: I won't let anything happen to you, Dawn.
TARA: Wriggling.
WILLOW: (exhausted) Tara, come on. You have to eat.
WILLOW: Don't know. Kinda getting used to picking fruit out of my hair.
GREGOR: (eyeing him carefully) You.
BEN: Just a friend of the family.
GREGOR: And would you die for them?
BEN: It's my life. I'll do what I please with it.
GREGOR: It's not just your life. Unimaginable  legions will perish, including everyone here. (soft, conspiratorial) You can stop this. You can save all  their lives... by ending one. The little  girl. The Key. Destroy it, and the  will of the Beast will be broken.  She will fade, a distant memory...  and this madness will end.
BEN: Sorry.
DAWN: Is he... is he going to be okay?
BEN: (avoiding the question) He was hurt pretty bad, Dawn.
DAWN: It's because of me. It's all my fault.
BEN: No, it isn't.
DAWN: You don't know what's happening.
BEN: I don't have to.
DAWN: Is that going to help?
BEN: You have to let me out!
DAWN: Ben - -
BEN: You don't understand! I got to get out! Open a door! NOW! 
BUFFY: What happened?
DAWN: I don't know! He just freaked out!
BEN: LET ME OUT!
BUFFY: Will, open a --
BEN: NO!
GLORY: Well what do you know! Little Ben finally did something right.
GREGOR: (genuinely terrified) The Beast.
GLORY: (recognizing him) Hey! It's Gregor!
DAWN: Buffy!
GLORY: Yeah, right.
BUFFY: Dawn!
BUFFY: Willow! Get it down! Now!
WILLOW: Hear... hear my plea... circling arms protecting me...
DANTE: The Beast ...
WILLOW: We... we have to ...
SPIKE: The car! Check for the keys!
WILLOW: Buffy... ?
WILLOW: Buffy, we... we have to look for Dawn. We can't let Glory... Buffy?
