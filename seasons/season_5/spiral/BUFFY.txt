Run!
We have to keep moving!
Just one. (a beat) Truck.
(not turning around) A truck hit her.
I don't know how we got away.  That truck couldn't have slowed  her down for more than a second.
Safe? We've barely been able to  manage not getting seriously dead  every time we cross paths with Glory.  Now that she knows about Dawn ...
I know. But it's done, and now we have to deal with it.
We can't fight her.
Not ever. She's too strong, Giles.  We're not going to win this with  spells or stakes or yanking out  uranium power cores. She's a god,  and she's coming for us. So let's  not be here when she starts knocking.
(increasingly frazzled) We can't stay here. Glory will kill us  off one by one until there's nobody  standing between her and Dawn.
(on the edge) No! We stay -- we die! Show of hands for that option?
Just get your stuff together. I'll take care of it.
He's here because we need him.
If Glory finds us, he's the only one  besides me that has a chance of  protecting Dawn.
This isn't a discussion! He stays. Get over it.
Maybe later.
For what?
(down on her herself) Yeah. I'm doing a great job.
I'm the Slayer. The Chosen one, all  mythic and defendery. Evil Nasties  are supposed to flee from me, not the  other way around.
Quaintly referred to in some cultures as the Big Scaredy Run Away.
It just... keeps coming. Glory. Riley. Tara. Mom --
There is?
(to Dawn) You know this is your fault for saying that.
Giles!
Dawn! Stay down!
We won't. (to Giles, whispered) Aim for the horsies.
Stay low! Watch out for --
Xander! Hatch!
(to Willow, re: Giles) Willow...?
You sure you're all right?
(to Dawn) They'll heal.
We'll -- we'll rest here for a minute.  Then we have to keep moving.
(snapping at him) I don't know! But we can't stay here. It's too close to the wreck, too easy to --
How is he?
Okay. Okay, just... just let me think --
Willow!
Dawn --
How long will it hold?
Let's find out.
Took you long enough. (eyeing his larger tattoo) You supposed to be some kind of chief?
Look at her that way again, and she'll be the last thing you ever see.
It's not that simple.
She doesn't remember anything about  being this Key everyone's looking for!  All she remembers is growing up with  a mother and a sister that love her.  What kind of god would demand her  life for something she has no control over?
(losing it again) It's not her fault! She's human now!
(on the verge of violence) I'm not going to let anyone --
What happened?
I'm sorry.
We should have stayed. If we had, none of this --
Running away?
Willow. Open a door.
One of my friends was hurt when you attacked us --
Will you let someone come and help him or not?
I'm done asking.
(into phone) Hey, it's Buffy. I need to ask you a really big favor ...
Sorry. I -- I didn't know who else to call.
Thanks for coming.
The guys with the pointy swords kinda have other ideas.
I know this must seem extra outer limits --
If things get too weird, just let me know. I'll understand.
No.
We're all going to make it. I'm not losing anyone.
Shut up!
Then why don't you fill me in?
Strong. Fast. Hellgod.
A demon dimension, I know. There  were two other Hellgods that ruled  with her, weren't there?
A god afraid?
Wait -- <u>male</u>?
(getting it) Kill the man, and the god dies.
I don't understand. I've seen Glory.  Not a whole lot going on in the hairy  chest department.
Dawn - -
Why didn't they destroy it? If the Key's as dangerous as you --
That's it? That's Glory's master plan?  Go home?
Dawn...
I don't know.
It's not you. You know that.
I won't let anything happen to you, Dawn.
What happened?
Will, open a --
Dawn!
Willow! Get it down! Now!
