... BODY!
Oh god≈Ø
Not really my color anyway.
That's not how it works. You know that.
If I did, do you really think I would tell you?
Glory! Her name is Glory. And she's your god, you little scab. Not mine.
You mean her divine failure, don't you?
Nothing's mine, is it? This body,  this life. It's all infected. The only  thing I've ever cared about she's  taken away from me.
To be close to people. To witness  their lives and their deaths. To be  there, alongside them, a part of  everyday humanity. (laughs bitterly) Or maybe it was the drugs.
Find the right combination... keep her buried where she belongs --
Oh yeah, I'm thrilled. Especially with  the part where she gets her Key back  and I cease to exist.
Not if I get to the Key first.
It doesn't matter how I came by it. It's mine.
You, uh, forgot to mention the costume party outside.
No, it's okay. I mean, yeah, not exactly  the way I pictured seeing you again, but -- (laughs) I'll take what I can get.
My pleasure.
I think I got him stabilized, but there's  a lot of damage. We need to get him out of here.
(facetiously) Don't they always?
This? Nah. I've seen things you  wouldn't believe. You know, emergency  room, full moon on a Saturday night ...
(smiling warmly) Don t worry about me. I won't leave till I've worn out my welcome.
Just a friend of the family.
It's my life. I'll do what I please with it.
Sorry.
(avoiding the question) He was hurt pretty bad, Dawn.
No, it isn't.
I don't have to.
You have to let me out!
You don't understand! I got to get out! Open a door! NOW! 
LET ME OUT!
NO!
