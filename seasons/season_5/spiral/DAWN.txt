(gasping) Wait... Buffy...
(gasping) I... I can't ...
Well, no, she more kind of waited  for it to hit Glory -- but then Buffy  ran really fast and we got away!
(rattled, trying not to show it) Cool. Won't have to study for that geometry test.
That kinda only works if you know where you're going.
Any luck?
Umm... Anybody hungry?
(gently) We know.
Hey. I think Anya's gonna try to cook.  Wanna come watch the tears and recriminations?
Thank you.
You know. Pretty much... everything.
You are.
You're not fleeing. You're... moving at a brisk pace.
(sincerely) It's the most amazing thing anyone's ever done for me.
(soft) I know. (a beat) But there's a bright side.
Yeah. At least things can't get any crazier, right?
Keep the pressure on.
Yeah. But Spike's hurt.
Buffy!
What about the Key?
(scared but determined) I want to know.

(soft) You think it's true? What he said?
(trying not to cry)  Destroyer of the universe. Guess cutting  school doesn't seem so bad now, huh? 
But it's in me, isn't it? It's inside me. (a beat, small) What are we going to do?
Is he... is he going to be okay?
It's because of me. It's all my fault.
You don't know what's happening.
Is that going to help?
Ben - -
I don't know! He just freaked out!
Buffy!
