(over Buffy) Gross!
My nog tasted funny. I think I got one with rum in it.
Uh, guys, hello? Puberty? Sort of figured out the "no Santa" thing.
Yeah.
All true?
I can't believe it. Oh, God...
How can you say it's not that bad?
Kevin Berman called me a freak. In front of everyone -- no, that's no big deal.
(sniffling) Forget it.
Yeah, real cool. I'm a suicidal headcase.
That's such a lie! I got cut -- by accident -- one time. Now Kevin thinks...
What a primo Bee-otch. I swear, if I could make her head explode using only the power of my mind, that's what I'd be doing right about now.
You know, my big sister could beat the crap out of her. I mean, really really.
Oh great, it's Art. I'm not gonna be able to look Kevin in the eye.
Yeah, freaky psycho gal.
Some. It's pretty much baby stuff.
We can go over it during study hall --
Hey.
Good, thanks for asking.
Oh. Hey Kevin.
(has no answer) Negative space.
(too cool) Shhyeah.
Thanks.
(embarrassed) Not even. That was a whole... that was so...
Yeah. I just, I had some intense stuff going on. Lotta people don't get that. Pain.
And then Kirstie's blabbing it everywhere. 'Cause she's...
(bummed) Oh.
(laughs) I know. She's so superficial. Everything's like, clothes, and who likes who, and there's just way more important stuff going on. There's a lot of crucial, you know, stuff.
(laughing) This one time, we were in History, and she had this book, Annals of History, only she didn't know how to say 'annals' and she kept calling it --
Well, what -- can't it wait? I'm in the middle of class...
I though Mom was gonna pick me up...
What's going on. Something's going on.
No. Tell me what's going on.
What is it? What happened?
Where's Mom?
Is she okay? Is she -- but she's okay... but it's serious but...
No...
No. NO NO No No you're lying you're lying she's fine she's FINE and you're lying oh no no please please no you're lying she's fine, she's fine...
It's not true it's not real it's not real ohhhhh noooooo....... no.....
(hugging Tara) I'm glad you guys came...
(to Tara and Xander) They're not telling us anything.
Can we see her?
But what about --
Nothing. I have to pee.
No. I still remember how to pee.
Yeah.
Is she cold?
Where'd she go?
