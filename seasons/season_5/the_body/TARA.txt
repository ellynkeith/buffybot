Oh, baby, do you want me to rub your tummy? (to Xander and Anya) She likes it when I... stop explaining things.
(to Dawn) Did you write him a letter?
There's a Santa Claus?
(meekly) Well, the reindeer part was nice...
I think they're here.
I can look again...
I think it's royal. Purple means royalty.
Shhh...
Shhhhhh, darling...
We can do this.
We can be strong.
(with a small affectionate smile) Strong like an Amazon, right...
Giles said that he was gonna go with Joyce and Buffy was going to... to school. To tell Dawn.
(to Xander) Do you know how to get to --
Not a lot.
Giles is pretty sure it wasn't her.
I don't think --
But I guess we can take over patrolling and all that.
For however long...
Do you think you could have left it in the laundry room?
I'll go check. (to the others) I'll be one minute.
Did I miss something?
It hurts.
I couldn't find it.
Yes.
She's been through so much this year...
You don't have to worry about me.
I have.
No, no, I didn't mean to -- I'm only telling you because, it's not m-my place, but... there's things, thoughts and reactions that I had, that I couldn't... understand, or even try to explain to anyone else. Thoughts that made me feel like I was losing it, or like I was just a h-horrible person. I know it's different for you, because it's always different, but... if you ever need...
What?
No. (thinks a moment) And yes. (beat) It's always sudden.
