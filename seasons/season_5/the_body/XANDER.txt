And then I'll be pretty much ready for barf!
No, no, barf from eating, 'cause all was good, and too much goodness --
How're you doing there, Will? Are you in the barf club?
Yeah, now Santa's gonna pass you right by, naughty boozehound.
What'd you ask for?
Advantage of a thousand year old girlfriend. Inside scoop.
Do you want to wait here?
Let 'em give me a ticket.
I'm not sure. Willow talked to Giles.
Hey...
How are you doing?
This is so totally wrong. This is just so... it's wrong.
God.
Yeah. It's at the hospital, it's a wing. (beat) We do morgue time in the scoobie gang.
(to Tara) What else did Giles say?
Are they sure this was... natural? I mean, Glory...
But I mean, she said she was gonna come after Buffy's family --
(overlapping) I mean we should be going after her, I mean she could have done it and, and covered her tracks.
I'll tell you what it is, it's the frickin' doctors, I mean they just let her out, you know, "clean bill a health, dig a hole in your skull here's a band-aid NEXT!"
Am I wrong?
Complications? Seems pretty simple to me. They shoulda checked her over, they shoulda had her in, what, she's got a clot? We don't have enough monsters in this town the doctors gotta help 'em out?
Things don't happen! I mean they don't JUST happen. Somebody's... I mean somebody's gotta...
You know I can't take you.
Yeah --
You know it.
We're cool.
Guys...
Sorry. Sorry.
As I was saying, some frustration, and now... I appear to be stuck.
Pretty much. I'm really sorry.
And once again with the sorry.
For a second there.
In my defense, some crappy wallmanship here.
Who did the drywall on this place?
Hold on...
It's okay.
(smiling softly) Yeah.
You're right. Avengers got to get with the assembling.
(hugging Buffy) Anything we can do...
What'd the doctor say?
Man, if there's one day they should not give you homework...
How'd she take it?
Anya, ever the wordsmith...
We'll come with.
She still in the bathroom?
Sure.
