You can't possibly be arguing that Marat didn't betray the French revolutionaries. This was the guy who declared the 'Rights of Man', and next thing you know he's killing Girondin like it's going out of style--
Buffy!
(vaklempt) Listen to us. We're arguing. We're having a debate about a college lecture. I've dreamt of this day since forever.
You're turning into quite the student. Should I be watching my occipital lobe?
Occipital, the lobe at the back of the brain. Like should I be watching my back? But you know, the back of my brain.
I don't know. You've been studying really a lot.
Isn't it crazy like that?
Poor Buffy's brain.
I'm in. Maybe we can argue some more about the French Revolution as we walk, huh? Wasn't Robespierre the coolest?
Just gettin' it going.
Thank you kind proprietor.
(looking around) Hey. Oh wow, this place is looking so great. I feel like a witch in a magic shop. Ooh, are those real newt eyes?
I don't know. If you ask me, the newt name still means something.
<u>You</u> should do it.
You're good, I'll prove it! Here...
Do me.
What do you see?
What about the crossword? Some say feed a cold, I say puzzle it.
You could make a game out of it. A very quiet game... about being a lump.
Maybe he knows his body can handle it. He <u>is</u> in really good shape.
I know. I'm sorry, Buffy. I'm trying too hard to make it okay.
It does have that icky government feel to it.
(to Buffy) Call the Initiative. If they know what's wrong with him, they have to help.
There's got to be a way.
Poor Riley.
Poor Buffy.
What are you talking about?
Tara and I can scope out the burnt out school. He hid there before, maybe it feels homey or something.
He does seem a little extra twitchy lately. I think the not-killing is getting to him.
(calling) Riley!
(you think it's bad now... ) Should've been here when it was a school. (calling) Riley!
Oof. Darkness.
Oo. I know. Better to light a candle than curse the damn darkness.
A little spell... "Fiat Lux."
That's better. (calling) Riley! Come on out!
You know. You taught me.
Oh yeah, I tinkered with the Tinkerbell. It was easy. And isn't this better than using a flashlight like some kind of doofus?
