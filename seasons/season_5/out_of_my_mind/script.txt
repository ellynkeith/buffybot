BUFFY: Riley!
RILEY: Buffy! What are you doing here?
BUFFY: My job...
RILEY: I just thought you were in the north sector -
BUFFY: Watch out!
BUFFY: Never mind.
BUFFY: Why do I even bother to show up?
BUFFY: What are you doing here, Spike?
SPIKE: (between blows) Same reason as you and your cub scout, I'd wager. Wanted a spot of violence before bedtime.
SPIKE: What? I softened 'im up.
BUFFY: Keep out of my way, Spike. I'm not gonna take this much longer.
SPIKE: So I should do what with my time? Sit at home knitting cunning sweater sets?
BUFFY: Would it keep you out of my way?
RILEY: She's right. You shouldn't be out here when she's patrolling.
SPIKE: Ooh. I saw that. Looks like neither boy is entirely welcome. Better take him home, Slayer, make him stay there. I got knitting needles he can borrow.
BUFFY: Spike, I just saw you taste your own nose blood and, you know what, I'm too grossed out to even hear you right now. Go home.
SPIKE: (called after them, defensive) It's blood! It's what I do!
RILEY: Hope I didn't get in the way.
BUFFY: Of course not. I was just startled. You know, and I don't love the idea of you patrolling alone...
RILEY: I'm not much for bench warming.
BUFFY: No, no - you made the squad. You tossed that vamp like he was a... little teeny vamp.
RILEY: You wanna go again? C'mon. I bet this place is just teeming with aerodynamic vampires.
BUFFY: Nah, unless we go back and kill Spike just for the fun of it...
SPIKE: I <u>will</u> know your blood, Slayer. I will make your neck my chalice and drink deep.
WILLOW: You can't possibly be arguing that Marat didn't betray the French revolutionaries. This was the guy who declared the 'Rights of Man', and next thing you know he's killing Girondin like it's going out of style--
BUFFY: Will. You're totally missing my point. I agree that Marat wasn't a real martyr. All I'm saying is, the death in the tub? The neck wound? All that blood? More fangy than knifey, okay? So Charlotte Corday was no martyr either--
WILLOW: Buffy!
BUFFY: (worried) What?
WILLOW: (vaklempt) Listen to us. We're arguing. We're having a debate about a college lecture. I've dreamt of this day since forever.
WILLOW: You're turning into quite the student. Should I be watching my occipital lobe?
BUFFY: Your what?
WILLOW: Occipital, the lobe at the back of the brain. Like should I be watching my back? But you know, the back of my brain.
BUFFY: Apparently not. Don't worry Will, you still wear the smarty pants in this family.
WILLOW: I don't know. You've been studying really a lot.
BUFFY: I try, but they're already piling on the reading and of course Giles is filling in the little corners of free time with extra training. I'm starting to think this working hard is hard work.
WILLOW: Isn't it crazy like that?
BUFFY: I thought it was gonna be more like in the movies. You know, inspirational music and a montage: me sharpening pencils, reading, writing, falling asleep on a big pile of books with my glasses all crooked because in the montage I have glasses. Real life is so slow and it hurts my occipital lobe.
WILLOW: Poor Buffy's brain.
BUFFY: I actually have to head to training right now, wanna come with?
WILLOW: I'm in. Maybe we can argue some more about the French Revolution as we walk, huh? Wasn't Robespierre the coolest?
BUFFY: (shocked) Robespierre, are you kidding me?
WILLOW: Just gettin' it going.
XANDER: Yeah, blueprints, not a bad idea. That and getting straight 'Measure twice, cut once'. You know for the longest time I had it backwards. Messy.
GILES: Well, I must say I'm impressed.
XANDER: Carpentry is pretty cool. Did you know that Harrison Ford used to be a carpenter?
GILES: They say Christ was a carpenter as well.
XANDER: (blase) Uh-huh. (excited) But Harrison Ford! Wouldn't it be cool if I could meet him, and like, talk about carpenter stuff? Particle board and, um, bevelling...
ANYA: Who put the monkey head near the Styx water? Do we <u>want</u> to pick exploded monkey out of our hair?
ANYA: Don't worry little guy. Anya's not going to let that mean water hurt you.
BUFFY: Trick or treat.
GILES: Hello you two, come on in.
WILLOW: Thank you kind proprietor.
TARA: (to Willow) Hey you.
WILLOW: (looking around) Hey. Oh wow, this place is looking so great. I feel like a witch in a magic shop. Ooh, are those real newt eyes?
GILES: No, too rich for my blood, I'm afraid. These are salamander eyes. It's the cataracts which give them their newt-like appearance. (defensive) They're really equally effective though. It's just a matter of overcoming snobberies.
XANDER: I'm telling you Giles, you gotta set up a blind taste test, prove once and for all that generic amphibian eyeballs are just as good.
WILLOW: I don't know. If you ask me, the newt name still means something.
GILES: Buffy. Are you ready to train?
BUFFY: You betcha.
GILES: Shall we then?
BUFFY: We shall then.
TARA: I just keep thinking how cool it would be if we could get a real psychic to set up here and read fortunes and stuff.
WILLOW: <u>You</u> should do it.
TARA: Not me. But I'd love to just watch and learn from someone who's really good, y'know.
WILLOW: You're good, I'll prove it! Here...
WILLOW: Do me.
TARA: Hmmm.
WILLOW: What do you see?
TARA: Willow-hand...
BUFFY: Riley!
RILEY: Just keepin' you on your toes.
BUFFY: Or off them as it were. What got into... oh my God, look at this place.
BUFFY: Thank you. Thank you so much.
GILES: It's just a token. You needed a proper space to train so...
BUFFY: I love it.
RILEY: (to Buffy) So c'mon, let's test this puppy out. Think you can take me?
RILEY: What's the matter, scared of a little competition?
BUFFY: This must have been so much work.
XANDER: (proud) I'm the dummy-man. (realizing) I mean. I made the dummies. The things you hit that don't hit back. Those, I made.
BUFFY: They're great. It's all great.
GILES: You've earned it. Truly.
BUFFY: Thanks guys, you're like a fairy godmother, Santa Claus, and Q all rolled into one. (then) Q from James Bond, not Star Trek. I'm going go get changed.
SPIKE: Oh Pacey, you blind idiot! Can't you see she doesn't love you?
SPIKE: Well well well. Lookie here.
HARMONY: (wild-eyed) Is it safe? Has Buffy gotten to you yet?
HARMONY: I saw her patrolling just now. With a stake! She won't give up 'til she's killed me to death.
SPIKE: (dubious) Buffy's looking for you?
HARMONY: Of course. That's why I'm on the lam. Didn't you hear? I'm totally her arch-nemesis.
SPIKE: (mock-serious) Is that right. I must have missed the memo.
HARMONY: (impressed) There was a mem..? (realizing) Oh. (then) Spike. Omigod, this is like a real emergency. I need a hideout so bad. You're my only hope. We're just gonna have to rise above our petty differences... Listen Spike, I'm desperate.
SPIKE: (insinuating) Desperate are you?
HARMONY: C'mon Spike, pretty please? I'll do anything.
SPIKE: Anything will you?
HARMONY: (oblivious) Yeah, I said I'd do anything... (suddenly getting it) Oo-oh. You mean will I have sex with you. Well, yeah!
SPIKE: (poker-faced) Taken up smoking then?
HARMONY: I am a villain, Spike, hello?
SPIKE: I guess you are, at that. I mean, with the Slayer on your tail and everything. She's not the type to give up, either. She'll hunt you down day and night, until you're too tired and too hungry to run any more and then...
SPIKE: Then that's you.
SPIKE: I think you're gonna hafta kill her.
HARMONY: I tried. It was all hard and stuff. You do it.
SPIKE: I would love to. But I can't. Remember?
HARMONY: Oh right. Guess it has to be me after all. Can you help with the thinking?
SPIKE: (generous) Yeah. I s'pose I could do that.
BUFFY: Mmm.
RILEY: Yeah.
BUFFY: That was relaxing...
RILEY: You want to relax some more?
BUFFY: Again?! Right away again?
RILEY: Maybe you're too tired.
BUFFY: I have the endurance of ten men.
RILEY: Let's make it women, okay? Just for the imagery?
BUFFY: Whatever. Takes a lot to wear me out.
RILEY: Oh, I love a challenge.
DAWN: Well, wouldn't <u>you</u>? Every kid tries to make the substitute cry. It's like a rite of passage.
JOYCE: I certainly would not. Being a substitute is an extremely hard job and... (she notices what Dawn is doing) Honestly Dawn, just how many bowls of cereal are you planning on eating?
DAWN: Oh, these aren't for eating. I had to get the extra out of the way so I could...
DAWN: ...get this! (sitting with a thump) Anyway, I want eggs.
JOYCE: You still want the cereal prize but you don't want the cereal. You are growing up. Alrighty, one half- omelet coming up.
DAWN: With ketchup if you please.
JOYCE: What is the - Who are you?
BUFFY: How are you? How is Mom?
DAWN: I'm okay.
BEN: And your mom's doing just fine.
DAWN: This is Ben. He gave me his stethoscope.
BEN: (to Dawn; mock-stern) Lent you his stethoscope. (extending his hand) Buffy, right? I'm Ben. I'm an intern here. I've had the pleasure of hanging out with the renowned Dr.Dawn here while your mom's been being tested.
RILEY: So what's going on? What happened to Joyce, to Mrs. Summers?
BEN: She's doing okay now. The doctors aren't sure exactly what caused the collapse. It could have been just a dizzy spell, low blood sugar, that sort of thing.
BUFFY: But it's nothing - Big, it's not something bad...
BEN: Very unlikely.
BEN: So your mom doesn't have any history of fainting?
BUFFY: No, I don't think so. She's usually really healthy.
BEN: I think they'll be running tests for a few more hours and they'll probably want her to come back in for some follow-up tests in a couple weeks but it doesn't seem like any thing too serious.
BUFFY: Oh thank God. I was really freaking out.
BEN: I think you should be able to take her home in a little bit.
RILEY: Well that's definitely good news.
DOCTOR: I know I'm repeating myself here, but I don't know how else to convince you. I have never in my thirty-plus years in medicine let a patient with tachycardia this severe leave a hospital---
RILEY: You said you couldn't keep me.
DOCTOR: Legally, no, I can't force you to do a thing. But with that pulse,believe me I'd get on my knees and beg you if I thought I could change your mind.
RILEY: (simply) You can't. I'm going home.
DOCTOR: And your friend here can't convince--
RILEY: I'm going.
DOCTOR: All right then. But you're leaving against my recommendation.
BUFFY: What is going on? Riley, what are you doing? What if you have a heart attack?
RILEY: Listen to me. Calm down.
BUFFY: <u>Me</u> calm down? I'm not the one with a pulse of 150.
RILEY: My heart's different than yours Buffy. It works differently now. But it's okay.
BUFFY: Riley, you're still a human, you could still have a heart attack--
RILEY: I'm a human who was used as a lab rat for months--
JOYCE: Hi.
BUFFY: How are you?
JOYCE: Embarrassed mostly. I'm sorry for putting you through all this. But no more tests, so you can take this pin cushion home.
RILEY: Let's get out of here.
WILLOW: What about the crossword? Some say feed a cold, I say puzzle it.
JOYCE: No thanks, Willow.
DAWN: I like chicken fingers with mustard when I'm sick.
JOYCE: I know you do, sweetie. I can make us some later.
BUFFY: No. Uh-uh. You stay here on the couch today.
JOYCE: I feel silly lying here like a lump.
WILLOW: You could make a game out of it. A very quiet game... about being a lump.
JOYCE: But I feel fine. Honestly, I'm more concerned about Riley than I am about me.
BUFFY: Mom, you shouldn't even be thinking about that. He's not worried, so I don't think we should be.
BUFFY: I don't get what he's thinking. Why isn't he worried?
WILLOW: Maybe he knows his body can handle it. He <u>is</u> in really good shape.
BUFFY: Nobody's body can handle a heart attack.
WILLOW: I know. I'm sorry, Buffy. I'm trying too hard to make it okay.
BUFFY: I just keep coming back to the Initiative.
WILLOW: It does have that icky government feel to it.
DAWN: Did you know that one time the CIA tried to kill Fidel Castro with poisonous aspirin?
BUFFY: Dawn. Please. (to Willow) I have to do something. I just have no idea how.
DAWN: Another time, the CIA--
BUFFY: Dawn.
DAWN: It's important.
DAWN: (quickly) Tried to make Castro go crazy by putting itching powder in his beard. (off Buffy's look) What? It's about the government.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) Call the Initiative. If they know what's wrong with him, they have to help.
BUFFY: Yeah but call them how? A: the Initiative doesn't exist anymore and secondly, they never claimed to exist in the first place. (then) It's so unfair! It's like, Big Brother can spy on you all the time, but when you actually have something to say, no one will listen.
DAWN: (softly) Sounds more like big sister.
WILLOW: There's got to be a way.
BUFFY: What am I supposed to do, take a tour of the White House and pretend to get lost, looking for some door with a sign reading 'Secret Government Monster Hunters, on it?
DAWN: I don't see why, if they're really spying on you all the time, you don't just say something when you know they'll hear you. Like sometimes I write fake things in my diary in case--
BUFFY: I gotta go. I'll see ya later.
DAWN: What'd I say?
BUFFY: Riley's in trouble. He needs help.
RILEY: (to the players) I'm out.
RILEY: Graham.
GRAHAM: Riley. Can we talk? This is Agent Goodman, Agent Brown.
RILEY: So talk.
GRAHAM: What's going on, man? We gotta get this taken care of. We gotta get you into an operating room.
RILEY: Very convincing. Makes me completely want to put myself under government control. Please take me to where you can make me unconscious and naked.
GRAHAM: You think I'd pull something on you?
RILEY: You're still in. I'm out. I don't know what orders you're following.
GRAHAM: Come <u>on</u>. You <u>know</u> Walsh pumped all those chemicals and crap into us. You got more than anyone. She messed us up bad.
RILEY: And now the government is knocking themselves out to kiss it and make it better.
GRAHAM: Riley. I'm telling you, you need help. I'm not saying it to trick you--
RILEY: Look, maybe you even believe it--
GRAHAM: I <u>know</u> it. I saw guys go through this. Remember Mason? Finally all patched up after the fight, then he got it too. He-- I'm sorry, but he's gone and it got pretty ugly. You don't want this.
RILEY: And you're sure you got the fix for it?
GRAHAM: Yeah. We got a guy, a doctor. He's going to take care of you and we're going to him <u>now</u>.
GRAHAM: I'm not giving you a choice.
RILEY: I guess you're not.
BUFFY: So you screwed up and he's gone and when are you even gonna tell me what's wrong with him?
GRAHAM: I'm not permitted to say...
BUFFY: Say.
GRAHAM: Hyper-adrenal overload and a bunch of stuff that sounds even worse than that and it all means he's way stronger than he ought to be and feeling no pain. His heart can't take it. We've been at him for weeks about it. (then) There's a specialist waiting at Sunnydale General, fourth floor, neurology. Get Riley there, 'cause if you don't...
BUFFY: I'll find him.
GRAHAM: I'll go tell the doc there's a hold up.
GRAHAM: And Buffy?
BUFFY: If you tell me to hurry I'm going to kick your ass.
WILLOW: Poor Riley.
GILES: Could he simply have gone back to his apartment?
BUFFY: No, not in his apartment; not at the library; not at the gym. He's gone somewhere where he doesn't want to be found.
ANYA: Basically he's gone AWOL.
BUFFY: Basically, exactly.
WILLOW: Poor Buffy.
XANDER: Maybe he just needs some time alone. (awkwardly) Like I had this friend once who really liked this girl and he got worried that maybe she didn't like him back and maybe that made him act like a total jerk and maybe Riley reminds me of this friend.
WILLOW: What are you talking about?
XANDER: Then again, maybe not. Maybe he just wants attention.
BUFFY: Well, here's a hot tip then: You want attention, be there so people can give it to you.
ANYA: I care about you Xander.
XANDER: (bewildered) Thanks.
ANYA: (to Xander) Don't be insecure.
XANDER: Thanks, I won't.
ANYA: 'Cause I also have this 'friend' and I have it on good authority that she really likes that guy, your 'friend'. And by the by, my 'friend'--
BUFFY: You guys! That's enough. Riley's in real danger here. Anya, Xander, I want you guys to check the docks.
XANDER: Aye Aye.
WILLOW: Tara and I can scope out the burnt out school. He hid there before, maybe it feels homey or something.
BUFFY: Homey. You know what else might be homey in a sort of dank, unpleasant, mostly evil way? The Initiative caves. But I don't know them too well...
GILES: We do have an associate who knows those caves like the back of his melanin-deprived hand.
BUFFY: Oh, I so don't want to deal with Spike right now. Guy's really starting to bug me in that special, "I'd like to shove something wooden through his heart" kind of way.
WILLOW: He does seem a little extra twitchy lately. I think the not-killing is getting to him.
BUFFY: And hanging out in that moldy crypt all day, you just <u>know</u> he's doing something nasty.
SPIKE: (resigned) Okay, is it bigger than a bread box?
HARMONY: (delighted) No... Four left.
SPIKE: So it's smaller than a bread box?
HARMONY: No-o! Only three.
SPIKE: (seething calm) Harmony. Is it a sodding bread box?
HARMONY: Yes! Omigod, someone's blondey bear's a twenty questions genius!
HARMONY: She's found me.
BUFFY: I've got a proposition for you.
SPIKE: Funny, 'cause I've got a proposition for you. What about knocking? It seems only fair considering we vamps can't enter your flat without an invite that you could at least-- say, look at those pretty pieces of paper.
BUFFY: Riley's sick with some Initiative thing and he's gone missing. I think he might be in the caves. If you find him and take him to the fourth floor of the hospital, you get the money.
SPIKE: Oh dear, the enormous hall monitor is sick? Tell me, is he going to die?
BUFFY: He's not the only one who can die, Spike.
SPIKE: Hey, I'm just saying, if this is really important to you, then I think I ought to get half now.
BUFFY: Fine.
HARMONY: So? What'd she say about me?
OVERHEISER: Any word?
GRAHAM: Nothing. But don't worry; they've gotta be here any minute now.
GRAHAM: That's soon enough, right? I mean, if we bring him in now?
OVERHEISER: I'll be honest. I'm not sure it's soon enough if you brought him in yesterday.
GRAHAM: Finally.
SPIKE: You got yourself a new patient, Doc.
OVERHEISER: Look, you don't understand. This is a complicated neurological procedure. And I-I've never performed it before.
SPIKE: (to Doctor) Little performance anxiety, eh? Butterflies in the old belly? (looks at Harmony) Harm, do us a favor. Shoot the nasty butterflies for the good doctor.
SPIKE: There you go, Doc. Not so complicated. Just do whatever those Initiative lab monkeys did, only backwards.
OVERHEISER: But this is a medical school, not a proper operating facility. (re tray) And these instruments--
SPIKE: They look pointy enough. (tossing it back onto the tray) They'll do.
OVERHEISER: You're not listening. That chip is deeply imbedded in your cerebral cortex. Removing it could leave you a vegetable.
SPIKE: Not gonna happen, mate. See, I've got faith in your survival instinct.
SPIKE: Yeah, you'll have me up and killing before the night's over.
SPIKE: Don't worry, Doc. You do me right, and nothing bad'll happen to y--
HARMONY: Oops. String was slippy.
WILLOW: (calling) Riley!
TARA: This place creeps me out.
WILLOW: (you think it's bad now... ) Should've been here when it was a school. (calling) Riley!
WILLOW: Oof. Darkness.
TARA: Piles of it. We should've brought a flashlight.
WILLOW: Oo. I know. Better to light a candle than curse the damn darkness.
WILLOW: A little spell... "Fiat Lux."
TARA: Whoa.
WILLOW: That's better. (calling) Riley! Come on out!
TARA: How'd you do that? With the light?
WILLOW: You know. You taught me.
TARA: I taught you teeny Tinkerbell light.
WILLOW: Oh yeah, I tinkered with the Tinkerbell. It was easy. And isn't this better than using a flashlight like some kind of doofus?
BUFFY: Riley!
BUFFY: Riley, answer me! (to herself) Please...
BUFFY: Riley?
RILEY: (without turning) You know this doesn't even hurt.
BUFFY: Your hand is bleeding.
RILEY: Don't feel a thing.
BUFFY: This stops now. I'm getting you to a doctor.
RILEY: The one from the government you mean? Like the ones who did this to me in the first place?
BUFFY: He's the only one who understands what's wrong with you. He's the only one who can help you.
RILEY: What's <u>wrong</u> with me? I'm more powerful than I've ever been, Buffy. Most people would kill to feel this way.
BUFFY: But the feeling's going to kill you. Your body wasn't built for this kind of stress-
RILEY: (hard) I can handle it. This is my deal, Buffy. Just back off.
BUFFY: What is this? What's happening to you?
RILEY: I go back, let the government get whimsical with my innards again, they could do anything they... best case scenario, they turn me into Joe Normal. Just another guy.
BUFFY: And that's not enough for you?
RILEY: It's not enough for you.
BUFFY: When did - why would you say that?
RILEY: Come on. Your last boyfriend wasn't exactly a civilian.
BUFFY: That's what this is about? You're going to die over some macho pissing contest?
RILEY: It's not about him. It's about us. You're getting stronger every day, more powerful... And I can't touch you. Every day you're just a little further out of my reach.
BUFFY: According to who? You want to touch me? I'm right here. I'm not the one running away.
RILEY: Not yet.
BUFFY: So you've got it all figured out. I'm bailing because you're not in the super club?
RILEY: It's human nature-
BUFFY: Don't psyche 101 me! Not now. Not after - after everything.... (then/pained) Nobody's ever known me the way you do, Riley. Nobody. I've opened myself up to you in a way that- God, you're just sitting back thinking it doesn't mean anything to me?
RILEY: I never said that-
BUFFY: (more and more upset) Well it obviously doesn't mean anything to <u>you</u>! Do you think so little of me-
RILEY: Buffy-
BUFFY: No! Do you think I've spent the last eight months with you because you've got super powers? If that's what I wanted I'd be dating <u>Spike</u>.
BUFFY: I need you. I need... to have you with me, healthy and, and... but if you want to throw everything away because you don't trust me, then... then I'm still gonna make you go to the doctor.
RILEY: Take me to him.
BUFFY: (softly) We have to hurry.
RILEY: (near-whisper) Loving you is the scariest thing I've ever done, Buffy.
BUFFY: I don't know why. (then) We'd better go. The doctor said we didn't have much time.
HARMONY: (to Dr.) I read in a magazine that some women think a man's real sex organ is his brain. (peering inside his cranium) Uch. No contest. I mean, look at it. It's so pink and wriggly looking. Can I touch it?
OVERHEISER: (together) <u>No</u>!
HARMONY: (startled) Omigod! You're awake?
OVERHEISER: Local anesthetic.
HARMONY: Wow. Spikey! How does it feel?
SPIKE: Like someone's cutting into my brain with a knife, you silly bint!
HARMONY: (considering that) Hmm. (to Doc) You know what it means that he can't hurt any living thing? It means he can't even pick flowers.
SPIKE: What? Yes, I can.
OVERHEISER: Please be quiet.
HARMONY: Is it supposed to be doing that?
OVERHEISER: Please! For God's sake, please be quiet.
HARMONY: Listen, buster, I don't see a crossbow in <u>your</u> hands, okay?
SPIKE: Harmony, if your incessant prattling bollixes up this operation, I'm going to personally yank out your pink and wriggly tongue!
HARMONY: What are <u>you</u> looking at?
BUFFY: Uh-oh.
RILEY: Graham?
RILEY: How many fingers?
GRAHAM: Seventeen.
GRAHAM: Hostile seventeen. And a blonde girl...
BUFFY: Spike and Harmony. Together again.
GRAHAM: Where's Dr. Overheiser?
BUFFY: (looking) They must've taken him. What do they- (understanding) Spike's chip. They're going to force the doctor to remove the chip in his-- (noticing) Riley?
RILEY: I'm okay... okay.
GRAHAM: We're running out of time. We don't find the medic soon, he's not gonna make it.
BUFFY: Okay... Brain surgery on Spike, they'll need a medical facility, equipment, for that, right?
GRAHAM: Big hospital.
RILEY: Graham. About before. Sorry.
GRAHAM: Forget it. Apologize later. If you're not dead.
BUFFY: You're not going to die.
RILEY: Bet you say that to all the boys.
BUFFY: (growing annoyed) Not all. I know one peroxide pest whose number's up. When I get my hands on Spike, I'm going to rip his head off. I'm gonna...
SPIKE: ...bathe in the Slayer's blood. I'm gonna dive into it, swim in it, do the bloody backstroke.
HARMONY: I see it, Spikey! I can see the chip. It's nestled in there like a pretty little Easter egg with your brain all around it like that green plastic grassy stuff, only this is more of a beige--
OVERHEISER: Would you please put out that cigarette? It's really not allowed.
HARMONY: (all tough) Oh yeah, sez who?
HARMONY: (earnest) Oh God, sorry! Didn't see the sign.
OVERHEISER: (faint surprise) The chip's out. I didn't think I could... but it just... It's out.
SPIKE: Yeah?
HARMONY: Yay! Yay for Spike!
SPIKE: Right, then. Stitch me up, Doc. Got places to go. And slayers to kill.
SPIKE: Listen to me, my stomach's growling, I'm so starved. I'm afraid I'm going to have to have me a little snack.
SPIKE: (off the Dr.'s look) Oh, don't worry... (then) I won't fill up on the bread, I'll still have plenty of room for the main course.
SPIKE: Slayer!
SPIKE: Suit up, Harm.
BUFFY: Stay here. We're going to need you.
SPIKE: Buffy. I swear I was just thinking of you. I wanted to tell you the great news. My head's all clear now. No more bug-zapper in my noggin.
BUFFY: That means I get to kill you.
SPIKE: You get to try...
BUFFY: Riley, be careful. Your heart!
SPIKE: Is he your sidekick now? That's too cute. You know, you should think about getting one of those motorbikes with the little sidecars. Could be precious. (re: Riley) Look at 'im go.
SPIKE: At long last.
SPIKE: AAAAAAAAA!
BUFFY: Riley! No!
SPIKE: A penny.
OVERHEISER: (deadpan) Told you I couldn't take it out.
BUFFY: Doctor! We need you now!
SPIKE: Buffy, Buffy, Buffy! Everywhere I turn she's there, that... that nasty little face, that bouncing shampoo- commercial hair. The whole sodding holier than thou attitude...
HARMONY: Aren't we kinda unholy by defin--
SPIKE: She follows me, you know. Tracks me down. I'm her pet project... drive Spike round the bend. Makes every day a fresh bout of torture.
HARMONY: Spike!
SPIKE: You don't understand! I can't get rid of her; she's everywhere. She's haunting me, Harmony!
SPIKE: This has got to end.
OVERHEISER: Buffy, he wants you. (to Riley) There. All patched up.
BUFFY: How's it going in there?
RILEY: Good. Back to normal.
BUFFY: Yeah.
BUFFY: And see? I'm still touchable.
RILEY: Give me a week or so to heal and I'll take full advantage of that fact.
BUFFY: Are you going to be okay? Because I should really go check on my mom.
RILEY: Go. I'll be fine.
BUFFY: I'll talk to you later.
GRAHAM: It hurts, huh?
RILEY: ('no duh') Yeah.
GRAHAM: Pain's your friend. Pain tells you you're alive.
RILEY: Well, then I am very alive. And my good buddy pain should feel free to stop reminding me any ol' time now.
GRAHAM: You had me scared. It's a good thing Buffy found you when she did, man, 'cause you were just about to detonate big time. I gotta say, she's pretty impressive.
RILEY: You know, she really is.
GRAHAM: (conversational) But you realize you don't belong here, right? This town. I mean, you're nothing here.
RILEY: Hey... what are you saying?
GRAHAM: Come on. You know it's true. There's nothing for you here.
RILEY: There's her.
GRAHAM: Right. Okay. There's "her". You used to have a mission, now you're what? The mission's boyfriend? The mission's true-love?
GRAHAM: You belong with us.
SPIKE: Shoulda known it's you. Been nearly six hours.
BUFFY: Would've been less if I wasn't busy cleaning up your mess.
SPIKE: My mess? I just borrowed the doc. The mess was yours, Slayer. Yours and the boy's.
BUFFY: I'm done. You're a killer and I should've done this years ago.
SPIKE: You know what? Do it. Bloody just do it.
BUFFY: What?
SPIKE: End my torment -- seeing you every day, everywhere I go, every time I turn around. Take me out of a world that's got you in it. (suddenly shouting) KILL ME!
BUFFY: I want you, Spike.
SPIKE: (overwhelmed) Slayer...
SPIKE: Oh Buffy. Buffy I love you. God I love you so much...
SPIKE: God, no. Please, no.
