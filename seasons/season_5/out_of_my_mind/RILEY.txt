Buffy! What are you doing here?
I just thought you were in the north sector -
She's right. You shouldn't be out here when she's patrolling.
Hope I didn't get in the way.
I'm not much for bench warming.
You wanna go again? C'mon. I bet this place is just teeming with aerodynamic vampires.
Just keepin' you on your toes.
(to Buffy) So c'mon, let's test this puppy out. Think you can take me?
What's the matter, scared of a little competition?
Yeah.
You want to relax some more?
Maybe you're too tired.
Let's make it women, okay? Just for the imagery?
Oh, I love a challenge.
So what's going on? What happened to Joyce, to Mrs. Summers?
Well that's definitely good news.
You said you couldn't keep me.
(simply) You can't. I'm going home.
I'm going.
Listen to me. Calm down.
My heart's different than yours Buffy. It works differently now. But it's okay.
I'm a human who was used as a lab rat for months--
Let's get out of here.
(to the players) I'm out.
Graham.
So talk.
Very convincing. Makes me completely want to put myself under government control. Please take me to where you can make me unconscious and naked.
You're still in. I'm out. I don't know what orders you're following.
And now the government is knocking themselves out to kiss it and make it better.
Look, maybe you even believe it--
And you're sure you got the fix for it?
I guess you're not.
(without turning) You know this doesn't even hurt.
Don't feel a thing.
The one from the government you mean? Like the ones who did this to me in the first place?
What's <u>wrong</u> with me? I'm more powerful than I've ever been, Buffy. Most people would kill to feel this way.
(hard) I can handle it. This is my deal, Buffy. Just back off.
I go back, let the government get whimsical with my innards again, they could do anything they... best case scenario, they turn me into Joe Normal. Just another guy.
It's not enough for you.
Come on. Your last boyfriend wasn't exactly a civilian.
It's not about him. It's about us. You're getting stronger every day, more powerful... And I can't touch you. Every day you're just a little further out of my reach.
Not yet.
It's human nature-
I never said that-
Buffy-
Take me to him.
(near-whisper) Loving you is the scariest thing I've ever done, Buffy.
Graham?
How many fingers?
I'm okay... okay.
Graham. About before. Sorry.
Bet you say that to all the boys.
Good. Back to normal.
Give me a week or so to heal and I'll take full advantage of that fact.
Go. I'll be fine.
('no duh') Yeah.
Well, then I am very alive. And my good buddy pain should feel free to stop reminding me any ol' time now.
You know, she really is.
Hey... what are you saying?
There's her.
