(wild-eyed) Is it safe? Has Buffy gotten to you yet?
I saw her patrolling just now. With a stake! She won't give up 'til she's killed me to death.
Of course. That's why I'm on the lam. Didn't you hear? I'm totally her arch-nemesis.
(impressed) There was a mem..? (realizing) Oh. (then) Spike. Omigod, this is like a real emergency. I need a hideout so bad. You're my only hope. We're just gonna have to rise above our petty differences... Listen Spike, I'm desperate.
C'mon Spike, pretty please? I'll do anything.
(oblivious) Yeah, I said I'd do anything... (suddenly getting it) Oo-oh. You mean will I have sex with you. Well, yeah!
I am a villain, Spike, hello?
I tried. It was all hard and stuff. You do it.
Oh right. Guess it has to be me after all. Can you help with the thinking?
(delighted) No... Four left.
No-o! Only three.
Yes! Omigod, someone's blondey bear's a twenty questions genius!
She's found me.
So? What'd she say about me?
Oops. String was slippy.
(to Dr.) I read in a magazine that some women think a man's real sex organ is his brain. (peering inside his cranium) Uch. No contest. I mean, look at it. It's so pink and wriggly looking. Can I touch it?
(startled) Omigod! You're awake?
Wow. Spikey! How does it feel?
(considering that) Hmm. (to Doc) You know what it means that he can't hurt any living thing? It means he can't even pick flowers.
Is it supposed to be doing that?
Listen, buster, I don't see a crossbow in <u>your</u> hands, okay?
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
I see it, Spikey! I can see the chip. It's nestled in there like a pretty little Easter egg with your brain all around it like that green plastic grassy stuff, only this is more of a beige--
(all tough) Oh yeah, sez who?
(earnest) Oh God, sorry! Didn't see the sign.
Yay! Yay for Spike!
Aren't we kinda unholy by defin--
Spike!
