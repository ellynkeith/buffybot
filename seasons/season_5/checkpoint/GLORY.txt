No, I'm good. It's okay.
Try not cutting things so close next time. Understood?
Cool. Okay, take this mess out with the rest of the trash. And you.
Got something to tell me?
And I'm waiting...
Meaning...
Fine.
I've been cooling my heels in this crappy little town long enough. Sunnydale's got too many demons, and not enough retail outlets.
Yeah... And I'll bet Mousy the Vampire Slayer has an idea where it is.
That bitch knows more than she's letting on, I can feel it.
Baby. If that girl's the only thing between me and my Key? I don't <i>need</i> much time.
Jinx? If you and Dreg have been using my moisturizer again I'm going to have to rip off your scaly- hey, what's the deal with your face?
It looks more like an enormous lumpy bruise. Does this hurt?
Huh.
He isn't going... He isn't going to <u>help</u>? All he needs to do is hand over that tiny squirming Slayer girl! I have business to do with her! If she knows where to start looking for my Key... Arrrh! Why won't he help? He knows her, he could go to her, he could talk to her, hell, he could seduce her and <u>bang</u> the Key out of her.
Well of course he's attractive, but he drives me insane. You know what I mean?
(as if it's a new concept) Yes! That's it exactly!
Sweet lumpy minion, you're the only one that understands. Probably 'cause I haven't sucked the brain out of you yet. He makes me so mad! If I could just get my hands on him, you know?
Long day, Sweetie?
So this is where the Slayer eats and sleeps and combs her hair. So <i>cute</i>. I can't even stand it.
Personally, I need more space, but this is good for you. It's so quaint and...
(mock scolding) Tsk. Buf-fee....
If I wanted to fight, you could tell by the being dead already.
So play nice, little girl.
The Key. Why else do you think I'd come here? See, I think you know where the Key is.
Well, it is the only thing keeping you alive right now. 'Cause you may be tiny Queen in Vampire World, but to me? You're a bug.
You should get down on your knees, and worship me.
But you still thinks it's "neat" having Slayer strength. Ooh, big deal, stronger than humans. Phht. Who <i>isn't</i>?
I could crush the life from you as easy as you'd break a nail. But I need the Key. (suddenly) Kid.
C'mere a sec.
Not asking twice...
(mock patience) No... this is between me and my Key. You just happen to be the thing in the way.
And you - are just the darlinest think I ever did see in my life. What's your name, honey?
<i>Dawn</i>. Did you know your sister took my Key, Dawnie? And she won't give it back. Bet you know where she put it, don't you?
Bet she takes your things all the time without asking, huh? Where's my Key, Dawn?
I like her, she's sassy. (beat) And I'll kill her. Kill your Mom. Kill your friends. Make you watch when I do. (shrugs) Just give me the Key. Either you have it, or you know where to find it.
Obviously, this is a one-time only deal. Next time we meet, something you love dies bloody. You know you can't take me. You know you can't stop me.
Oh. And the next time you have guests? Little plate of sugar cookies. I'm just saying.
