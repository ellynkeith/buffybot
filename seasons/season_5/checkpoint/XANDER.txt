Sorry I'm late. (re: cast) This thing makes driving an adventure in steering.
There's, like, a sweater under the sofa.
(off Willow's look) Well, I can't get it. Your troll broke my wrist.
That must've belonged to... (realizes) Um... aren't we s'posed to have a meeting?
Yeah, don't they have phones? Hallo, Buffy, here's some stuff we know, pip pip.
Yeah, but that's not new. You always take care of her.
Best friends. Willow and me and Buffy - the three of us have been together from the beginning. We've always gone on patrols and done demon research with her and everything.
No. But I did get a whole lot of knowledge about the military...
...and then I lost it.
I don't have powers, but I do help.
Oh! Last year, Willow and Giles and me combined our essences with Buffy. Which isn't as weird as it sounds. (proudly) We merged and I was the heart-part of a super-Buffy. Again, let me stress the not-as-weird thing. I'm told it was all very professional.
Yes! She'd never let us get hurt.
She's saved my life lots of times!
Anya! (then) Forty? No! No! Wait, that's not the way to look at it. I don't know if you guys are worried about what Buffy's doing to us or what we're doing to her or whatever, but I can promise you that none of us would ever do anything to put her in danger. We couldn't.
Look at them. Big tough Council members, picking on the books.
'Cause if they deport him, they're not just destroying his career - they're condemning the man to a lifetime diet of blood sausage, bangers and mash.
(quietly) That was excellent.
(quiet pride) I've clocked field time.
