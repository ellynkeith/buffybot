Mistress - at last we've found one.
We are here for you, great one.
As always.
(nods) Indeed, Glorificus.
We have found that the signs of alignment are moving... faster than expected.
If you are to use the Key - you must act quickly.
All you need is the Key...
If I may remind your eminence: (small) ... You don't have much time.
Begging permission to speak with you.
Not me. The magnificent Glory. She wants. She wants more information on the Slayer. She knows you know her.
Oh, I believe you do, sir. She's short, symmetrical, hair on top... Buffy something-
That's the one. Very clever of you.
I do not know. I was not there. But the beauteous Glory said for you to tell us, please. Where her dwelling is, who her friends are...
I don't know, sir. She just said to tell you to do it for her. That was her message.
It's a message.
Very much.
It's a message from Ben. He isn't going to help.
He's quite attractive.
He drives you insane.
