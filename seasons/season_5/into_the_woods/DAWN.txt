Are you kidding?
When I was younger, I used to put my chopsticks in my mouth like this...
(talking around the fangs) ...and Buffy would chase me around the house yelling "I'm the Slayer! I'm gonna get you!"
No, it was great! She didn't really stake me in the heart, you know.
For you. You always win.
Got it.
That one looks sad.
I meant the other one. I don't wanna see a sad movie.
That's okay. You guys don't have to make a big deal for me. The only reason I'm sleeping over here is so Buffy and Riley can boink.
Yeah, 'Alone time' always translates into 'Get Dawn out of the house so we can have loud obnoxious sex.'
