I need to talk to you.

We have a Code One in Belize. A demon tribe is tearing apart missionaries in the rainforest down there.
We're going down to terminate their operation. Want you to join us.

When demon activity goes unchecked in parts of the world most people don't want to know about - we move in. It's not the Initiative, Finn. We don't do experiments. None of us gives a damn what makes monsters tick. We just stop 'em.

Come on, Finn!
