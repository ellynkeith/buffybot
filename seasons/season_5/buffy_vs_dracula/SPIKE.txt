Can't be too careful. Got quite a few demons after me these days… (then) Where's your better half? Bet she wouldn't like you being here at night all by your lonesome. It's dangerous.
Then I demand my heckling time. Got to be a give and take, right?
I'll play.
Dracula? Poncy bugger owes me eleven pounds for one thing.
Know him? We're old rivals. But then he got famous and forgot all about his foes… (then) I'll tell you what, that glory hound's done more harm to vampires than any slayer. His story gets out and suddenly everybody knows how to kill us, the mirror bit…
(scoffs) Nothing but showy Gypsy stuff. What's it to you, anyway?
Drac's in Sunnydale? Guess the old boy needed closure after all.
Tough talk, cowboy. But you're not going to catch him napping in a crypt. No, "The Count" has to have his luxury estate and his bug- eaters and his special dirt, doesn't he?
No, I'm saying you should go home to your superhoney and have a nice, safe snog. You're out of your depth on this one, boy.
(steps up) I'd like to see you try.
(calls after) You're never gonna find him! (softer) Not before he gets to her…
