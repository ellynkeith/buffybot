BUFFY: Touchdown! Yes! Go team <u>Me</u>!
RILEY: Anybody ever told Team You that the quarterback throws like a girl?
BUFFY: I do?
XANDER: I'm exhausted just looking at those two. The splashing and the jumping and the running… Shouldn't relaxing involve less exertion?
ANYA: Absolutely. Exertion can lead to sweatiness.
TARA: Which can cause the pain and heartbreak of stinkiness. Better to just stay put.
WILLOW: I think we've just put our finger on why we're the sidekicks.
WILLOW: Game over?
RILEY: Buffy slayed the football.
BUFFY: It was an accidental… slew. (then/ to Xander) Where are the burgers?
RILEY: Yeah man, I'm starving. Cow me.
XANDER: I'd love to make with the moo but the fire's not cooperating. I think this charcoal is made out of water.
WILLOW: What's the deal, Xand? I thought you were a cow griller by trade.
XANDER: Well they had a newfangled gas stove at the burger place.
ANYA: Plus they fired him in like a day.
XANDER: Anya embarrassing me in public! Who saw <u>that</u> comin'?
ANYA: (to others) He's fine. He's back to working muscle-y construction.
XANDER: Not for long. The job is over in a couple weeks - then all my ends will be loose again.
RILEY: Tell me about it. I'm kind of in drift mode myself these days.
BUFFY: You're not drifty. You have school.
RILEY: Yeah - but I'm not even sure what I'm doing. (back to Xander) I mean, I figure I do want my masters in psychology… But, there's different areas… The new advances in psycholinguistics are intriguing - but I've really always thought of myself as a congnative neurobiology guy.
XANDER: I hear ya.
WILLOW: (offers/ to Riley) I do. Really. I was gonna structure my major around computer science - but now I don't know… what if drama class is awesome? Do I cast off the safe and dependable for the exhilarating unknown?
TARA: Maybe you should take the class before you re-think your life plan. I mean, it's not like the Goddess Thespia rules your seventh house.
WILLOW: Ohhh, God… See that's… The Goddess Thespia - she was a total drama queen and… (running out of steam) The seventh house, that's like when… Ahhhh… Whooo…
TARA: (embarrassed) It's okay. I keep forgetting - jokes should have funny parts.
WILLOW: It <u>was</u> funny. Super funny and clever and… (giving up) Fire ready yet?
XANDER: It's comforting to know I lack the culinary finesse of a caveman.
WILLOW: (Latin) Ignis incede. (translation) Fire arise.
BUFFY: Willow! Check you out! Witch-fu!
WILLOW: (falsely humble) It's no big. You just have to balance the elements, so when you affect one you don't end up causing-
WILLOW: I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
WILLOW: There you go. All set.
GILES: Thank you, Willow. That obstinate machine simply refused to work for me.
WILLOW: Just call me the computer whisperer. (then) Well - let's get scanning. I want to see this puppy go.
GILES: You can start with these.
WILLOW: (expression falling) Start? Where is finish?
GILES: It's essential that we begin archiving the library, Willow. Most of these texts have no duplicates.
WILLOW: But - now? Doesn't winter seem more like archiving season? Nothing like a nice warm cup of cocoa and some archivin', I always say. Or, I plan to say that…
GILES: You don't have to, Willow. You're welcome to go if-
WILLOW: No. it's fine. It's just, you've been Mr. Project all summer. I mean, labeling the amulets, indexing your diaries… (not unkindly) I draw the line at making giant rubber band balls. That's when you'll just have to get a life.
GILES: That's what I'm trying to do, actually. Get a life.
WILLOW: Might go better if you left the house.
GILES: Willow. You musn't repeat What I'm about to say to you. Especially not to Buffy.
WILLOW: Uh oh.
GILES: Do you swear?
WILLOW: (anxious) Oh God… I guess. Now that I know there's something to know - I can't <u>not</u> know just because I'm afraid someone will know I know, you know?
GILES: (baffled) Did you mean yes?
WILLOW: Yeah…
GILES: We're doing all this because I want you and the others to have everything you need at your fingertips. You see, I'm going back to England.
WILLOW: You're - what? But you can't. You're Buffy's watcher. I mean, in a fired way.
GILES: It's become quite obvious that Buffy doesn't need me anymore. And I don't say that out of self pity, I'm quite proud, actually.
WILLOW: (desperate) But what about the rest of us? We still need to be watched. Personally, I can't get through a day without a little hairy eyeball.
GILES: I appreciate the sentiment, but it's just not so. You'll be fine. You all will. (kindly) And we'll stay in touch. You can call me whenever you like. (off her silence) It's time from me to get on with it, Willow. I need to find out what's next for me - and England's my home.
WILLOW: When are you going to tell Buffy?
GILES: Soon. I'll know when the moment's right.
WILLOW: It better be soon. A girl can only contain "I have a secret face" for so long.
GILES: I promise. (then) It won't be easy, but I know she'll understand.
BUFFY: No way. This is so wrong.
BUFFY: Take this away. Whatever it is.
RILEY: It's tuna. Or… a pop tart.
BUFFY: That's it. I'll face monsters, but I'm done helping you clean.
RILEY: You're not seeing the whole sexy bohemian thing? 'Cause I had it on good authority that chicks dig slack.
BUFFY: Actually I'm starting to miss the whole military fold-your-clothes- with-a-ruler experience.
RILEY: You should talk. Your drawer's a mess.
RILEY: (joking) -- oh, no. That's my drawer. Sorry.
BUFFY: You sure that's yours? Looks kinda…snug.
RILEY: Maybe you should try it on. You know - just so we can see who it belongs to.
BUFFY: Ooh. I'd love to.
BUFFY: But I promised my mom I'd hang at the homestead tonight. She's bummed that I'm going back to the dorm - feeling all empty nesty.
RILEY: That's cool. I gotta get through all this - hey, old mail. Bonus.
BUFFY: I'd better scram. I'm late.
RILEY: (distracted) Okay… Say hi to your mom.
BUFFY: Thanks, mom. Everything was mega yum.
JOYCE: Are you up for desert? We could take a drive, get some ice cream.
BUFFY: I would - but I have to get out and patrol.
JOYCE: Now? It's 8:30.
BUFFY: Vamps don't care what time it is, mom. Dark equals dinner bell.
JOYCE: Right. Of course… (then) I'm going to have you to get used to this place without you again. It gets so quiet.
BUFFY: (kindly) You should get a pet. A loud one.
JOYCE: Not a cat. Too pathetic.
BUFFY: Understood. How about a rat? Amy makes a lot of noise on that little wheely thing.
JOYCE: Too creepy.
BUFFY: Then a puppy. One of those kinds with the smooshy face.
JOYCE: Maybe. I'll think about it.
BUFFY: Good… This was great though
JOYCE: It was.
BUFFY: We'll do it again when school starts. Make a regular date night.
BUFFY: Sorry. Duty calls. It's a total drag.
MAN: An impressive hunt. Such power.
BUFFY: That was no hunt. That was just another day on the job. Care to step up for some overtime?
MAN: We are not going to fight.
BUFFY: (sardonically) Do you understand what a slayer is?
MAN: Do you?
BUFFY: Who are you?
DRACULA: I apologize. I assumed you know. (a beat/then) I am Dracula.
BUFFY: <u>Get out</u>!
WILLOW: (re: drink) There's something in these. If I don't' get my daily fix I start to get itchy.
XANDER: Well you gotta stop ordering the Crackachino. What do you got, double espresso in there? It's not safe.
WILLOW: But it makes me so cute and mood-swingy!
XANDER: Yay…
WILLOW: Xand? What if somebody had a secret, and that somebody promised somebody else that she wouldn't tell anyone, and-
XANDER: (cutting her off) News flash, will. Everybody knows.
WILLOW: It's not about me and Tara.
XANDER: Oh. Not that I wouldn't be all ears if you wanted to tell me a secret about you two. Even if it was very, very naughty.
WILLOW: Sorry. This is of the non-naughty variety. And I'm not telling.
XANDER: 'Kay. Want to see if Buffy's hanging 'round the headstones?
WILLOW: Sure. Anyway, if I did tell you - which I'm not going to…
BUFFY: So - let me get this straight. You're Dracula. The guy. The count.
DRACULA: I am.
BUFFY: This isn't just a fanboy thing, is it? 'Cause I've fought more than a couple of pimply, overweight vamps who called themselves "Lestat."
DRACULA: You know who I am. As I would know without question that you are Buffy Summers.
BUFFY: You've heard of me?
DRACULA: Naturally. You're known throughout the world.
BUFFY: Naw!… Really?
DRACULA: (smiles) Why else would I come here? For the sun? (then) I came to meet the renowned killer.
BUFFY: I prefer the term "Slayer." "Killer" just sounds so…
DRACULA: Naked?
BUFFY: Like I paint clowns or something. I'm the good guy, remember?
DRACULA: Come now. You can't deny your history.
BUFFY: What do you mean, history? I hail from a long line of white hats, period.
DRACULA: Perhaps. But your power is rooted in darkness. You must feel it.
BUFFY: No, you know what I feel? Bored.
BUFFY: (frustrated) Okay. That's cheating.
XANDER: Hey Buff. What's up?
WILLOW: Yeah, you look like you saw a --
BUFFY: (urgently) Get out of here. <u>Now</u>.
XANDER: Fine. I was going to give you a sip of my double mint mocha but-
BUFFY: Behind you!
WILLOW: (small) Hi.
XANDER: Nice. Look whose got a bad case of Dark Prince envy.
DRACULA: Leave us.
XANDER: No, we're not going to "Leabbb you." And where'd you get that accent, Sesame Street? "One, Two, Three - three victims! Maw ha ha!"
BUFFY: Xander, I'm pretty certain that's <u>Dracula</u>.
XANDER: Wow. Really? Hey, sorry man… I was just, jokin' around…
DRACULA: (smiles ruefully) This is not the time. I will see you soon.
BUFFY: Bat! Eww! Bat!!
XANDER: (scoffing) Oh, yeah. Vampires can't even do that- (realizing) How'd he <u>do</u> that?!
XANDER: …so then Buffy's all - look out! - and then friggin' <u>Dracula's</u> standing right behind us and can I just say he's in serious need of a monster make-over?
WILLOW: And then he lunges at us - Like WOOSH, and-
XANDER: He totally looked shorter in person-
BUFFY: I told you he'd heard of me, right? Can you believe that? Count Famous heard of me?
RILEY: I couldn't believe it the first twenty times you told us, but it's starting to sink in now.
BUFFY: Sorry. Am I repeato girl? I guess I'm a little blown away.
RILEY: It's not that surprising that he knows you, Buffy. You are the slayer.
BUFFY: I guess. But the way he said it, he made it sound so-
WILLOW: Sexy. I bet he made it sound sexy.
BUFFY: Kinda. He of the dark, penetrating eyes and lilty accent…
TARA: (to Willow) You thought Dracula was sexy?
WILLOW: (oops) What? Oh, no. he was - yuck.
ANYA: Right. Except for the whole tall, dark and handsome thing. Yucko.
XANDER: How would you know?
ANYA: (casually) Oh, we hung out a few times.
XANDER: You "hung out" with Dracula?
ANYA: (wistfully) Back in my demon days. Only once or twice. He was really cool. (off their looks) You know - from an evil thing perspective.
XANDER: (bristling) Please. He was no big whoop…
WILLOW: No big whoop? What about the thing where he turned into a bat? That was awesome.
GILES: It must have been. I have to admit - I'm sorry I missed that.
WILLOW: Me too. I kept thinking - gosh, I wish Giles were here. He'd know what to do. (to Buffy and Xander) Didn't you guys? Think that?
XANDER: Ahhh - definitely.
BUFFY: Actually, I was more thinking - "<u>BAT!!</u>"
XANDER: So how come he can do that?
GILES: I've no idea. There's a great deal of myth about Dracula - I'd imagine the trick to defeating him is in separating the fact from the fiction.
WILLOW: Great point! It's so <u>Giles</u> to think of something like that. Which we would have never.
BUFFY: Right… I guess we should take things slow with Dracula. He said we'd meet again, but I'd like to avoid it until we do some serious homework-
RILEY: I don't know. He may have a Bunch of swell party tricks but he's still just a vampire. I say we load up with stakes and crossbows and go after him now.
XANDER: (raises his hand) Second.
ANYA: No, Buffy's right. Dracula's too slick to fall for the usual stuff.
BUFFY: So we hold off. No killing until we know exactly what we're dealing with.
RILEY: You're not just saying that because of those dark, penetrating eyes of his, are you?
BUFFFY: No, his eyes were just - there was no penetration. Cross my heart.
GILES: Alright. Willow, you and Tara find anything you can on the actual legend of Vlad the Impaler on the internet. I'll search the library.
RILEY: (frustrated) If the Initiative was still around we'd be able to find everything on this guy in a few hours.
BUFFY: We may not be as fast - but we'll find him. Let's say we reconvene here in the morning?
RILEY: So what's your plan?
BUFFY: Big sleep. My count encounter wiped me out.
RILEY: I'm kind of wired. Maybe I should just let you rest.
BUFFY: You sure? I bet if you just lay down with me-
RILEY: Nothing you are about to say will lead to rest.
BUFFY: (smiles) Good point. So I'll see you here?
RILEY: With donuts.
BUFFY: Ummm. Heaven.
BUFFY: See? A little sugar and I'm all  yours. Dracula Shmakula.
ANYA: …I doubt he'd remember me. I was just a silly young thing - 700 or so. But he did say that the guy I cursed was doomed forever. Which was sweet, don't you think?
XANDER: (unhappily) Adorable.
ANYA: I mean, it was a great spell. I made this jerk incredibly fat, like a human mini-van. You know you should just mention my name if you see him again…
XANDER: (fuming) Or better yet - why don't you just go sit on a crypt and flaunt your neck cleavage until he shows up? Then you two can talk private.
ANYA: Please. Don't tell me you're jealous.
XANDER: Oh no. Just because you're panting over the guy-
ANYA: I am not panting. And besides, why can't I get a little swoony now and then? You have Miss Tool Belt.
XANDER: Miss - who? Tool… That's so- (changing tactics) You've been snooping!
ANYA: I was not. If you don't want me to find your booby calendar, don't hide it with the dental floss.
ANYA: Now stop being silly. (gives him a peck) See you tomorrow.
XANDER: You don't want to come back to my place?
ANYA: It's "whites" day, remember? The bleach smell makes me nauseous.
XANDER: Fine. I suppose Dracula doesn't' use bleach, huh? He's a darks only man!
XANDER: Great. Perfect… Know what? You're not so big. One round of old fashioned fisticuffs, and I bet you'd fold like a bitty baby… (then/dukes up) Okay. Lets do it. No "poofing."
XANDER: Come on, Puffy Shirt. Pucker on up, 'cause you can kiss your pale ass good-
DRACULA: Silence.
XANDER: Yes, Master.
XANDER: No! That's not-
DRACULA: You will be my emissary. My eyes and ears in daylight… (then) The slayer. I want to know everything.
XANDER: Your emissary…
DRACULA: Serve me well and you'll be rewarded. I'll make you an immortal. A child of darkness, feeding on life itself, on blood…
XANDER: (growing excited) <u>Blood</u>. Yes, yes… I will serve you, your excellent spookiness- (off Dracula's look) -or Master. I'll just stick with Master.
DRACULA: Go now.
XANDER: But, Master, how can I find - ?
XANDER: Brilliant. What an exit. Guy's a genius.
RILEY: I'd put that down unless you're bucking for one hell of a headache.
SPIKE: Can't be too careful. Got quite a few demons after me these days… (then) Where's your better half? Bet she wouldn't like you being here at night all by your lonesome. It's dangerous.
RILEY: Cut the crap, Spike. I'm looking for some information.
SPIKE: Then I demand my heckling time. Got to be a give and take, right?
RILEY: (sighs) Give me something useful and you can talk all the trash you want.
SPIKE: I'll play.
RILEY: What can you tell me about Dracula?
SPIKE: Dracula? Poncy bugger owes me eleven pounds for one thing.
RILEY: You know him?
SPIKE: Know him? We're old rivals. But then he got famous and forgot all about his foes… (then) I'll tell you what, that glory hound's done more harm to vampires than any slayer. His story gets out and suddenly everybody knows how to kill us, the mirror bit…
RILEY: But he's not just a regular vampire. He has special powers, right?
SPIKE: (scoffs) Nothing but showy Gypsy stuff. What's it to you, anyway?
RILEY: He's in town, making his presence known.
SPIKE: Drac's in Sunnydale? Guess the old boy needed closure after all.
RILEY: Actually - seems like he might be gunning for Buffy. But I'm out to find him before he gets another shot at her.
SPIKE: Tough talk, cowboy. But you're not going to catch him napping in a crypt. No, "The Count" has to have his luxury estate and his bug- eaters and his special dirt, doesn't he?
RILEY: So you're saying I should check out mansions? That sort of thing?
SPIKE: No, I'm saying you should go home to your superhoney and have a nice, safe snog. You're out of your depth on this one, boy.
RILEY: You've helped Buffy before. Chips were down, you jumped sides long enough to make yourself useful. So she has a problem with killing you now that you're helpless. (beat) I don't.
SPIKE: (steps up) I'd like to see you try.
RILEY: (steps up, is much taller) Would you?
SPIKE: (calls after) You're never gonna find him! (softer) Not before he gets to her…
DRACULA: You're magnificent.
BUFFY: Bet you say that before you bite all the girls.
DRACULA: No. You're different. Kindred.
BUFFY: Kindred? Hardly, I --
DRACULA: Pull your hair back.
BUFFY: Ha. You really think you can just waft in here with your hypno eyes and you music video wind and - and…
DRACULA: I've searched the world over for you. Yearned for you…
BUFFY: He was-
DRACULA: Unworthy. He let you go.
DRACULA: But the embrace. His bite… you remember…
BUFFY: No…
DRACULA: Don't fight (then) I can feel your hunger.
RILEY: It's jelly - want it?
XANDER: Got it. Mine, mine…
WILLOW: Well, I think we got some Dracula factoids…
XANDER: (snorts) Like any of that's enough to fight the Dark Master- (off their looks) - bator.
WILLOW: A lot of it we already knew… Turn offs: wood, fire, crosses, garlic. Turn ons: nice duds, minions and long slow bites that last for days…
RILEY: Yeah, I did a little research, too. Dracula likes to live in style. Which means we can rule out the usual dumps vampires haunt.
XANDER: Ah! But he's smart enough to figure we'd know that. I'm guessing he's laying low.
WILLOW: Actually, my research backs Riley up. Drac isn't the lay low type.
GILES: So we'll check the nicer places first - don't you think, Buffy?
GILES: Buffy?
BUFFY: Hum? (then/to Giles) Right - sorry. Swanky places first. What else did you guys get?
GILES: Well, Willow found most of it, actually-
WILLOW: (quickly) Only because you gave me super pointers. I never would have-
GILES: (cutting her off) Just - go ahead, Willow.
WILLOW: Okay. Dracula's modus operandi is different from other vampires. He'll kill just to feed, but he'd rather have a connection with his victims. And he has all kinds of mental powers to draw them in. He can read and control minds, appear in dreams.
BUFFY: Huuuuh.
WILLOW: It makes sense. That stare… he kind of looked right through you… Didn't you feel it Buffy?
BUFFY: Nope. Uh uh.
XANDER: See? Buffy didn't feel it. I think you're drawing a lot of crazy conclusions about the Unholy Prince. (off their looks again) - bator…
GILES: The point is - he goes through the motions of an intimate seduction, but it always ends the same. He turns the victim into a vampire.
XANDER: (eyes still on spider) Well, that is intimate. Dracula's gifting these ladies with his own blood. And blood - blood is life! (quickly) According to them.
GILES: Just be aware that he tends to develop a relationship with his prey. It's not enough for him to take her, she has to want to be taken. She has to burn for him -
BUFFY: (hastily) That's interesting. I'll go look for him.
RILEY: You shouldn't go alone, Buffy. This guy is seriously dangerous.
BUFFY: It's cool. I'm on top of it.
WILLOW: No, he's right Buffy. It's safer.
BUFFY: Thanks, but I've got it under control. Really.
RILEY: Take off that scarf.
BUFFY: What? I will not.
RILEY: You're under the thrall of the Dark Prince!
BUFFY: (blustering) Please. I am not under the thrall of the Dark Prince!
RILEY: Then take that scarf off.
BUFFY: Let me go. This is ridiculous-
RILEY: Buffy…
BUFFY: Oh, God…
GILES: Why didn't you say anything?
XANDER: 'Cause she didn't want to worry us, right Buffster? It's nothing. Just a scratch -
WILLOW: (not buying it) Two deep, puncture-y scratches.
BUFFY: I'm not sure why I tried to hide it. I guess I was embarrassed that I let him do this to me… And, I don't know, I couldn't fight this voice telling me to cover it.
RILEY: What did I tell you? That's thrall.
XANDER: (scoffing) You're saying Dracula has some sort of freaky mind control over her? You've been watching too many creature features man.
BUFFY: It does seem like he's got some kind of control over me, even though a big part of me is resisting…
RILEY: What do you mean, a part? Only <u>part</u> of you is resisting? (worried) Which part's not?
BUFFY: Riley -
RILEY: No, it's okay. I shouldn't take this personally. I mean, what with Angel, it's understandable that there would be transference. I mean, they're both broody immortals…
BUFFY: (firmly) Listen to me. I'm not transfer-y I swear. I'm your girl, and I'm going to stay that way.
RILEY: Okay. But you're not going anywhere near him again.
GILES: Riley's right. You'd best keep out of sight while the rest of us look for Dracula.
BUFFY: (nods) I can't go home. He already got inside once.
XANDER: (eagerly) You can come to my place. I'll make sure you stay put.
GILES: Good. Riley and I will search for Dracula. Willow, you and Tara do a protection spell at Buffy's house to prevent him from returning.
WILLOW: Got it. (then) How did he get inside, anyway?
JOYCE: Hoe seemed so nice and normal… A little pale…
WILLOW: A good Sunnydale rules of thumb? Avoid white-skinned men in capes.
JOYCE: (a tad defensive) I didn't - he was in a suit. A lovely suit… He came by the gallery, and he was amazingly well informed about art history-
TARA: Probably because he was around for most of it.
JOYCE: I want you both to know, I am not like this. I do not invite strange men over for coffee. It's just , it's been way too long. (quickly) Since I met anybody. You know, someone even remotely interesting.
JOYCE: When you girls get older, you'll understand. It's hard to date. Sometimes you feel like giving up on men altogether.
RILEY: Another bust.
GILES: And it's getting dark. (upset with himself) I should have turned up a better lead. There must be an easier way to find him.
RILEY: Too late to worry about that now. If we hurry we can still hit these last places.
ANYA: …and how come I have to be here slayer-sitting while the other guys get to look for Dracula? Just because -
XANDER: (interrupting her) What time is it?
ANYA: Almost six. (not missing a beat) I mean - I'm the one who knows him. I'm the one who's had a really good look, right? So why does -
XANDER: (matter of fact/ to Buffy) I'm supposed to deliver you To the Master now. There's this whole deal where I get to be immortal… Are you cool with that?
XANDER: (matter of fact/ to Buffy) I'm supposed to deliver you To the Master now. There's this whole deal where I get to be immortal… Are you cool with that?
BUFFY: Take me to him.
XANDER: Master - I deliver the slayer. She who you most desire! Sorry, 'whom.'
XANDER: So now comes the immortality, right? You do the thing and -
DRACULA: (eyes still on Buffy) Leave us. We must not be interrupted.
XANDER: You bet. But I'll be outside, whenever. Any old time you feel like bestowing eternal life… or, you know, just a little nibble of something fleshy…
DRACULA: I knew you'd come.
BUFFY: Why? 'Cause I'm under your thrall?
BUFFY: Well, guess again, pal.
DRACULA: Put the stake down.
BUFFY: (instantly obeys) Okay.
BUFFY: Right. That was - that was not you. I did that because I wanted to, and - and… (uh oh) Maybe I should rethink that thrall thing.
RILEY: (facetious) I've lived in Sunnydale a couple years now. Know what I never noticed before?
GILES: A castle?
RILEY: A big, honking castle.
RILEY: Let's split up. You stay here - I'll take the next corridor down.
BUFFY: Stay away from me…
DRACULA: (smiles) Are you afraid I'll bite you? Slayer, that's why you came.
BUFFY: No… last night was… That's not gonna happen again.
DRACULA: Stop me. Stake me.
BUFFY: I'm… any minute now…
DRACULA: Do you know why you can't resist?
BUFFY: 'Cause you're famous?
DRACULA: Because you do not want to.
BUFFY: (tries to look away) My friends are -
DRACULA: They're here. They will not find us. We are alone. Always… alone.
DRACULA: There is so much I have to teach you. About your history, your power… What your body is capable of…
BUFFY: (breathless denial) I don't… need to know…
DRACULA: (leaning in) You long to. And you will have eternity to discover yourself. But first… a little taste.
BUFFY: I won't… let you…
DRACULA: I didn't mean for me.
GILES: Good show, Giles. At least you didn't get knocked out for a change -
GILES: (nervously) Ah, ladies… You would be the three sisters, yes?
GILES: Excellent. Right. I'd heard you were only myth but… Obviously erroneous.
GILES: Heh! That's… Tickles…
GILES: Oh dear God.
XANDER: Nobody harms my Master.
RILEY: Your Master - ?
XANDER: You want him? You come through me.
RILEY: Okey-dokey.
BUFFY: What are you…
DRACULA: All these years, fighting us - your power so near to our own - and you've never once wanted to know what it is we fight for? Never even a taste?
BUFFY: No… if I taste that -
DRACULA: I have not drunk enough for you to change. You must be near death to become one of us and that will come only when you plead for it.
BUFFY: I'm not hungry.
DRACULA: No. Your craving goes deeper than that.
DRACULA: You think you know. What you are, what's to come… you haven't even begun.
DRACULA: Find it… the darkness…. Find your true nature.
BUFFY: Wow.
BUFFY: That was really gross.
DRACULA: You are resisting…
BUFFY: Looks like…
DRACULA: Come here. Come to me.
BUFFY: You know, I think the thrall has really gone out of our relationship. But I wanna thank you for opening my eyes a little.
DRACULA: What is this…?
BUFFY: My true nature. Wanna taste?
DRACULA: You cannot run from your darkness.
BUFFY: Who says I'm running? Come on Drac. We did your little dance. Let's see if you're any good at mine.
RILEY: (calling out) Buffy, are you - Giles!
RILEY: Grab on, hurry!
GILES: Thank God you came. I was doomed. There was no possible escape -
GILES: Is that my shoe? Silly me, I'll just pop down and-
RILEY: No sir. No more chick pit for you.
BUFFY: A guy like you should think about going electric. Seriously.
BUFFY: No you don't -
BUFFY: (quite intensely) How do you like my darkness now?
RILEY: Buffy? Are you okay?
BUFFY: I'm good. Chock full of free will.
GILES: And Dracula?
BUFFY: Eurotrashed.
GILES: Oh. Had hopes to meet him… well, to fight him…
XANDER: Where is he? Where's the creep who turned me into his spider- eating man bitch!? I've got a flaming enema with his name on it-
BUFFY: He's gone.
XANDER: Damn it!.. You know what? I'm sick of this crap. I'm sick of being the guy who eats the insects and gets the funny syphilis! As of this moment, it's <u>over</u>. I'm finished being everybody's butt monkey!!
BUFFY: Check. No more butt monkey.
RILEY: It could have been worse. At least you weren't making time with the Dracubabes like Giles here.
XANDER: No kidding? You got tranced?
GILES: (appalled) I did not. And I was not making time! I - I was just about to kill those loathsome creatures when Riley interrupted me-
RILEY: Really? You were gonna nuzzle 'em to death?
GILES: Of course not. I was in complete…
GILES: …control.
BUFFY: You think I don't watch your movies? You always come back.
BUFFY: You rang?
GILES: Yes. Thanks for coming. Can I offer you some tea?
BUFFY: You put out cookies. How come I rate little cookie treatment?
GILES: Well, actually, there's something I have to tell you.
BUFFY: Cookie important? Yeah, I guess I have something too.
GILES: Well - you first, by all means.
BUFFY: That's okay -
GILES: I insist.
BUFFY: You know, you haven't been my watcher for awhile. I haven't been training, I haven't needed to come to you for help -
GILES: I agree.
BUFFY: And then this whole thing with Dracula, it's made me face up to some stuff.. I've changed so much since I first became the slayer. I'm still changing. Ever since we did that spell that called on the first slayer… I've been going out a lot. Every night…
GILES: Patrolling.
BUFFY: <u>Hunting</u>. That's what Dracula called it, and he was right. He understood my power, better than I do. He saw darkness in it. (then/heartfelt) I need to know more. About where I come from. About the other slayers. Maybe if I learn to control this thing - maybe I could even be better, stronger… But I'm scared. It's gonna be hard, and I can't do it… without you. (then) I need your help. I need you to be my watcher again.
BUFFY: So - I just talked all over you. You had something to say too.
GILES: No. it was - it was nothing.
BUFFY: I'm outta here. Riley and I are going to the movies.
JOYCE: Okay. Have a good time.
BUFFY: What are you doing in here?
DAWN: (together) MOM!!
