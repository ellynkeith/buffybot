I apologize. I assumed you know. (a beat/then) I am Dracula.
I am.
You know who I am. As I would know without question that you are Buffy Summers.
Naturally. You're known throughout the world.
(smiles) Why else would I come here? For the sun? (then) I came to meet the renowned killer.
Naked?
Come now. You can't deny your history.
Perhaps. But your power is rooted in darkness. You must feel it.
Leave us.
(smiles ruefully) This is not the time. I will see you soon.
Silence.
You will be my emissary. My eyes and ears in daylight… (then) The slayer. I want to know everything.
Serve me well and you'll be rewarded. I'll make you an immortal. A child of darkness, feeding on life itself, on blood…
Go now.
You're magnificent.
No. You're different. Kindred.
Pull your hair back.
I've searched the world over for you. Yearned for you…
Unworthy. He let you go.
But the embrace. His bite… you remember…
Don't fight (then) I can feel your hunger.
(eyes still on Buffy) Leave us. We must not be interrupted.
I knew you'd come.
Put the stake down.
(smiles) Are you afraid I'll bite you? Slayer, that's why you came.
Stop me. Stake me.
Do you know why you can't resist?
Because you do not want to.
They're here. They will not find us. We are alone. Always… alone.
There is so much I have to teach you. About your history, your power… What your body is capable of…
(leaning in) You long to. And you will have eternity to discover yourself. But first… a little taste.
I didn't mean for me.
All these years, fighting us - your power so near to our own - and you've never once wanted to know what it is we fight for? Never even a taste?
I have not drunk enough for you to change. You must be near death to become one of us and that will come only when you plead for it.
No. Your craving goes deeper than that.
You think you know. What you are, what's to come… you haven't even begun.
Find it… the darkness…. Find your true nature.
You are resisting…
Come here. Come to me.
What is this…?
You cannot run from your darkness.
