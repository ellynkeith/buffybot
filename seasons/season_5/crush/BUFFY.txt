Gee... maybe it's time you found another place to patronize.
What are you doing, Spike?
Here. At this table. Talking to me. Like you and I are some kind of... talking buddies.
Actually, you were sleeping the sleep of the knocked unconscious.
Poor Will. Headaches still coming?
Will, this is the first R&amp;R I've had in weeks. Can I just go one night without hearing the name "Glory."
(noticing something off) Ben...
Hey.
Barely recognized you out of your hospital scrubs.
Really?
Listen... My sister... she told me what happened at the hospital. Before I got there.
I just wanted to tell you... You know, thanks... For looking after her...
Probably just as well you didn't. Things got a little hairy. But everything's back to normal now.
Yeah, she's fine. And maybe something good'll come out of all this hospital time, like she'll become a doctor.
Back by popular demand. How's everything with the home team and do I smell popcorn?
Mmm. Artificial cheese flavored powder. Nature's perfect food.
(a bit surprised) You know, I think I did. Much needed fun. Apart from Willow's headaches and Spike's cameo appearance--
Unfortunately. You know, for a "keeps to himself" kind of vamp, he's, like, everywhere I go.
(searching) I dunno... He's cranky the Bronze got rid of the flowering onion appetizer.
So... Dawn. Was she-- you know...?
Then let me ask you something... We, Mom and I've been going a little easy on her these past few days. You know, letting things slide... bedtime, chores... And other things.
You don't?
You think so?
Thanks.
DAWN!!!
What did I tell you about borrowing my clothes without asking?
Bull.
Oh, really. There, where's my blue cashmere sweater?
The test is tomorrow. I don't have to have an opinion 'til tomorrow.
Kinda not. I rented the movie.
I'm not sure. Was he one of the singing gargoyles?
I'm kidding!
You done with this?
(reading) "...unconfirmed reports of severe trauma to the throats of one or more of the victims..."
Survey says... Vampire.
It's me.
No. Isn't she here?
It's not Glory. It isn't about Dawn, Mom. She probably just- I'll find her.
(a promise) I'll find her.
Spike, I need your help. Dawn is... (seeing her) here.
What the hell is this? (to Spike) What is she doing here?
Here?!
Yeah, okay. Let's hear the story Spike's been telling my little sister.
Dawn, grab your things and let's get outta here.
I don't want to hear one more word form you.
...And then to find you enjoying story hour at Spike's crypt... A <u>crypt</u> Dawn! Not some "Hot Dog on a Stick" boot at the mall, but a real live crypt with a real dead vampire. Why doesn't that register with you? Crypt plus vampire equals bad.
Spike. Hanging out with Spike is not cool, Dawn. It's dangerous and... icky.
Well think again sister, he's...
(realizing) You have a crush on Spike.
(serious) Spike's a killer, Dawn. You cannot have a crush on a thing that's dead and evil and <u>a vampire</u>.
Angel was different. He has a soul.
Dawn, I don't want to hear this. Spike is a <u>monster</u>. Plus, you're only fourteen years old.
What does that mean.
(uncomprehending) Heh?
(looking around) Clues.
I don't know. Something. Anything. Just want to make sure this was a vamp attack. And if it was, how many are we talking about?
Xander...
Never mind.
Dawn said that...
Forget it.
Dawn things... She says that.... Spike might be in love with me.
It's not a joke.
I'm serious. <u>This</u> is serious.
So you can stop laughing now.
It's creepy.
I guess.
She was with Spike yesterday afternoon. I think she's got a little crush on him.
(musing) I knew he had this weird fixation for me, but--
Let's go. There's nothing here.
And he just decided to hang for awhile.
What about?
Sorry. All out of cash. Maybe you should hit on Giles-- hit up Giles--
Do tell.
Nothing. Just...
Abandoned?
Hey, uh--
Eeeew.
(calmly reiterating) Eeeew.
Where are the bad guys? It's been almost an hour.
I'm fine.
If you're not doing this for money, then why--
Them?
Those vamps have been here a while. They've nested.
No. I'm saying they had nothing to do with last night's murders.
Whoever did it only just arrived in town last night.
Looks like you just wasted my time.
What are you--
What is this, Spike?
No. I mean, what is <u>this</u>? The late night stake out, the bogus suspects, the flask... Is this a <u>date</u>?
Oh no. No... Are you out of your mind?
No! Feelings <u>do</u>
<u>not</u> develop. No feelings!
Loathing. Disgust-
Please. You're a vampire, Spike!
Angel had a soul. He was good.
You mean the chip? That's not change. That's just holding you back. You're like a serial killer in prison-
(cutting him off) Stop. You don't mean this. You don't even know what... feelings are.
You sleep during the day.
(desperate) DON'T! ...say...don't.
I'm going.
(cutting him off) <u>We</u> don't need to do anything. There is no we. Understand?
Yeah.
You can stop when you get to "moo."
I didn't let him get that far. But I could see the words coming.
Well... I do beat him up a lot. (off Joyce's looks) For him, that's like third base.
Not really. As long as it's chips ahoy in Spike's head, he can't hurt me or any of you guys. (then) Besides, this'll blow over. I'm sure it's just some weird Spike thing. He'll have the hots for some Gak Demon before we know it.
Pretty twisted.
Yeah. I think so... I don't know. I was kind of thrown.
What? No! I have to <u>avoid</u> him again.
The bud nips me?
Thanks, but I think this is something I have to do myself. I mean, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this whole thing's been blown out of proportion and Spike's gone back to wanting me dead.
You know what, though? There is something I'd like you to do while I'm gone...
(calling) Spike?
Hello? You here?
Spike... What have-- What's happened?
Dru... Drusilla...
What is going on?
Oh my God...
It's called "revulsion." And whatever you think you're feeling... it's not love. You can't love without a soul.
That's not going to prove anything. Except that you're a miserable, sick vampire I should've dusted a long time ago. And, hey, already there.
Go mock yourself.
Not to me. Kill her. Why do I care?
Spike... The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
Which question do you want me to answer first?
(not turning around) What part of punching you in the face did you not understand?
This changes everything. You're out, Spike. I want you out of this town. I want you off this planet. You don't ever come near me, my friends and family again. Ever - understand?
