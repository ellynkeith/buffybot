Cheddar.
(taking interest) Spike was there?
(casually) So, um... What was he doing? Did you, like, talk to him about.. you know, stuff? What'd he say?
Huh...
(to herself) Likes onions.
I thought you were adequate.
What!
I didn't take your clothes!
I never touched your stuff!
I'm not lurking. I'm looking. What are you doing?
(re hole) So is that how you get around town during the daytime? Does that lead into the sewers or something? Could you show me?
Yeah, right. 'Cause nothing would make her happier than me hanging out after school in a vampire's lair. (she turns and adds offhandedly) Especially yours.
I don't feel like it right now.
Why not?
I'm not a child. (then) I'm not even human. Not originally.
That's smart. I get that. I like how you talk to me like I can understand things. Everyone else is being all twitchy and secretive.
I feel safe with you.
I mean, you've got that whole super- strength thing. And you're just as tough as Buffy is. Maybe tougher. Even Buffy thinks so.
Well, she's always worried about what she's gonna do if you ever get that chip out of your head. I figure she's scared that maybe you could take her.
And the lady just invited you in?
And did you? Let him live?
No. Keep going. I mean, it's gross, but I want to know what happens.
Spike was telling a story and he was just at this cool part. Can he finish, please?
Just hanging out.
Just let him finish the story, okay? Then you can do the lecture?
Go on, Spike.
What? That's so lame.
'Cause it was Spike?
I don't think Spike is icky.
No, I don't! It's just he's got cool hair and he wears cool leather coats and stuff. And he doesn't treat me like an alien.
Right. That's why you were never with Angel <u>for three years</u>.
Spike has a chip. Same diff. He fights demons too y'know. He told me about some pretty gross fights actually--
I like hanging out with him, is all. And even if I did have a crush, he'd never in a million years notice. Not with you around.
He's totally into you.
Come on. You don't see it? Buffy, Spike's completely in love with you.
Even though it was so not his fault.
