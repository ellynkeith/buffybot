SPIKE: Jacking up the bar prices to pay for fixin' up this sinkhole. Not my fault their insurance doesn't cover Act of Troll.
BUFFY: Gee... maybe it's time you found another place to patronize.
SPIKE: Got half a mind to. 'Specially since the flowering onion got remodeled right off the sodding menu. Only thing this place 'ad going for it... 'Course I have spotted some walnutty muffin tops that--
BUFFY: What are you doing, Spike?
SPIKE: What you mean, what am I--?
BUFFY: Here. At this table. Talking to me. Like you and I are some kind of... talking buddies.
SPIKE: Well... Saw you sittin' alone. Thought... I dunno, you could, maybe, do with a bit of, you know, company.
SPIKE: Suit yourself.
SPIKE: Just... I mean... we took on that Glory chippee together. I was right there with you, fighting the fight...
BUFFY: Actually, you were sleeping the sleep of the knocked unconscious.
SPIKE: Still. Points for intent. You'd think that'd be enough to cut me a sliver of slack. Earn me a little consideration, respect--
XANDER: (to Spike) Hey, Evil Dead, you're in my seat.
SPIKE: Bugger it.
ANYA: Xander, I think you may have hurt his feelings.
XANDER: And you should never hurt the feelings of a brutal killer. (realizes) Actually, that's pretty good advice.
XANDER: So, who's for another round of liquid refreshments? I'm buying. For I am Payday Man.
ANYA: Yay. I love Payday Man. He's cool <u>and</u> rich.
WILLOW: I could use some water.
XANDER: Water poses no challenge for Payday Man for I have-- (scans the table) Hey, where's my change? It was right he--
XANDER: Spike, you diabolical fiend.
BUFFY: Poor Will. Headaches still coming?
WILLOW: Fewer and further between, but, yet. they're still exercising their visitation rights.
TARA: Honey, in case you didn't hear me the first six thousand times: No more teleportation spells.
WILLOW: Hey, you won't get any argument from me. (considering) Or maybe a tiny one. (off Buffy's look) It's just... we've got squat in the way of Glory fighting arsenal. Another run in with her and my headaches and nosebleeds will be the least of our problems.
BUFFY: Will, this is the first R&amp;R I've had in weeks. Can I just go one night without hearing the name "Glory."
TARA: I'm down with that. In fact, let's just call She Who Will Not be Named another name entirely... Let's call her00
BUFFY: (noticing something off) Ben...
TARA: ...for example.
BUFFY: Hey.
BEN: Buffy. Hi.
BUFFY: Barely recognized you out of your hospital scrubs.
BEN: You'd be surprised the extent of my wardrobe.
BUFFY: Really?
BEN: (nodding) I've actually got entire outfits that aren't blue-pajamas.
BUFFY: Listen... My sister... she told me what happened at the hospital. Before I got there.
BEN: Uh huh.
BUFFY: I just wanted to tell you... You know, thanks... For looking after her...
BEN: That's okay. Sorry I wasn't able to stick around.
BUFFY: Probably just as well you didn't. Things got a little hairy. But everything's back to normal now.
BEN: I'm just glad Dawn's okay.
BUFFY: Yeah, she's fine. And maybe something good'll come out of all this hospital time, like she'll become a doctor.
BEN: Oh, don't let her. (conspiratorially) It's really hard.
XANDER: The point is I work for that money.
SPIKE: And you're saying I didn't?
XANDER: What? Yes, I'm saying that. You didn't! You stole!
SPIKE: And you're making it into very hard work.
SPIKE: (distracted) Yeah? Like you could ever hurt me...
PORTER: Sunnydale Station! Last stop on this line!
PORTER: Oh God... Oh please...
PORTER: Help me! Please! Help m---!!!
JOYCE: (calling) Buffy?
BUFFY: Back by popular demand. How's everything with the home team and do I smell popcorn?
DAWN: Cheddar.
BUFFY: Mmm. Artificial cheese flavored powder. Nature's perfect food.
GILES: Did you have a nice time?
BUFFY: (a bit surprised) You know, I think I did. Much needed fun. Apart from Willow's headaches and Spike's cameo appearance--
DAWN: (taking interest) Spike was there?
BUFFY: Unfortunately. You know, for a "keeps to himself" kind of vamp, he's, like, everywhere I go.
DAWN: (casually) So, um... What was he doing? Did you, like, talk to him about.. you know, stuff? What'd he say?
BUFFY: (searching) I dunno... He's cranky the Bronze got rid of the flowering onion appetizer.
DAWN: Huh...
DAWN: (to herself) Likes onions.
JOYCE: Well, I'm just relieved to have you home. To be honest, I wasn't feeling all that safe with you gone.
JOYCE: (getting it) ...At first... Until I remembered that Mr. Giles... Rupert... was here and I felt much... <u>much</u> safer.
GILES: Yes, well, my ego thanks you for your little ruse, but I'm forced to agree that I'm barely and adequate substitute for a slayer in the house.
DAWN: I thought you were adequate.
GILES: And the accolades keep pouring in. I'd best take my leave before my head swells any larger. Good night.
JOYCE: 'Night.
BUFFY: So... Dawn. Was she-- you know...?
GILES: As far as I can see, she appears to be coping very well. <i>Extremely</i> well, considering the extraordinary circumstances of her origin.
BUFFY: Then let me ask you something... We, Mom and I've been going a little easy on her these past few days. You know, letting things slide... bedtime, chores... And other things.
GILES: Oh, I don't think that's at all wise.
BUFFY: You don't?
GILES: The best thing you could do is behave exactly as you always have. Any special treatment at this stage could undermine Dawn's sense of normalcy.
BUFFY: You think so?
GILES: Absolutely.
BUFFY: Thanks.
BUFFY: DAWN!!!
DAWN: What!
BUFFY: What did I tell you about borrowing my clothes without asking?
DAWN: I didn't take your clothes!
BUFFY: Bull.
GILES: (gesturing toward the door) I'll just... Yes.
DAWN: I never touched your stuff!
BUFFY: Oh, really. There, where's my blue cashmere sweater?
HARMONY: Spikey...
HARMONY: Aren't you coming to bed?
SPIKE: Not tired.
HARMONY: Me, neither...
HARMONY: Don't you want to come in and...
HARMONY: Tire me out.
SPIKE: Harm! Really not in the mood right now.
HARMONY: Tsk. You're never in the mood. (kissing his ear) We can do something different tonight.
SPIKE: Like what? You stop yammering for two seconds?
HARMONY: Well... we could, I don't know... maybe play a game?
HARMONY: (stiltedly) Oh, I'm gonna stake you. I'm coming after you, you bad, evil vampire. And I'm gonna... <u>slay</u> you!
HARMONY: I'm sneaking up and I'm gonna stake you so much with my Slaying powers that I have because I'm the Chosen -- woop!
HARMONY: (pleased) Oh! Spike!
WILLOW: I just don't see why he couldn't have ended up with Esmerelda. They could have the wedding right there. (a little misty) Beneath the very bell tower where he labored thanklessly for all those years...
TARA: No, see, it can't end like that, 'cuz all of Quasimodo's actions were selfishly motivated. He had no moral compass, no understanding of what was right. Everything he did, he did out of love for a woman who'd never be able to love him back. Also, you can tell it's not gonna have a happy ending, when the main guys all bumpy.
WILLOW: What do you think, Buffy?
BUFFY: The test is tomorrow. I don't have to have an opinion 'til tomorrow.
WILLOW: But you read it, right?
BUFFY: Kinda not. I rented the movie.
TARA: With Charles Loughton?
BUFFY: I'm not sure. Was he one of the singing gargoyles?
WILLOW: Uh boy.
BUFFY: I'm kidding!
BUFFY: You done with this?
WILLOW: (reading) "Six found Murdered on Train at Sunnydale Station."
TARA: Glory?
BUFFY: (reading) "...unconfirmed reports of severe trauma to the throats of one or more of the victims..."
BUFFY: Survey says... Vampire.
SPIKE: Oh, it's you. What are you doing lurking about?
DAWN: I'm not lurking. I'm looking. What are you doing?
SPIKE: Nothing.
DAWN: (re hole) So is that how you get around town during the daytime? Does that lead into the sewers or something? Could you show me?
SPIKE: No! Why are-- Does Buffy know you're here?
DAWN: Yeah, right. 'Cause nothing would make her happier than me hanging out after school in a vampire's lair. (she turns and adds offhandedly) Especially yours.
SPIKE: Go home then.
DAWN: I don't feel like it right now.
SPIKE: Well, you can't bloody well stay here.
DAWN: Why not?
SPIKE: Because! I've got things to do. (off her look) Things... Bad things. Bad, evil things. That are not for a child's eyes.
DAWN: I'm not a child. (then) I'm not even human. Not originally.
SPIKE: Well, originally, I <u>was</u>. I got over it. Doesn't seem to me it matters very much how you start out.
DAWN: That's smart. I get that. I like how you talk to me like I can understand things. Everyone else is being all twitchy and secretive.
SPIKE: Just trying to keep you safe, I expect.
DAWN: I feel safe with you.
SPIKE: Take that back.
DAWN: I mean, you've got that whole super- strength thing. And you're just as tough as Buffy is. Maybe tougher. Even Buffy thinks so.
SPIKE: (taking interest) She... She does?
DAWN: Well, she's always worried about what she's gonna do if you ever get that chip out of your head. I figure she's scared that maybe you could take her.
SPIKE: Really.
SPIKE: So... what else does Buffy say about me?
BUFFY: It's me.
JOYCE: Is Dawn with you?
BUFFY: No. Isn't she here?
JOYCE: She never came home from school. Buffy... The news said something about people murdered...
BUFFY: It's not Glory. It isn't about Dawn, Mom. She probably just- I'll find her.
JOYCE: Buffy...
BUFFY: (a promise) I'll find her.
DAWN: And the lady just invited you in?
SPIKE: Well, I had hubby by the throat, didn't I? Promised her he'd live if she did the invite.
DAWN: And did you? Let him live?
SPIKE: What do you think?
SPIKE: Too much for you?
DAWN: No. Keep going. I mean, it's gross, but I want to know what happens.
SPIKE: Well, I went into the house. Lady was there with a couple teenaged sons. Little older than you. I killed 'em right quick, the whole lot. But... someone was missing. There was supposed to be a little girl. So I got real quiet.
SPIKE: (very soft) And I hear this tiny noise coming from the coal bin... this little sigh... so I listened harder... it's very, very quiet...
SPIKE: Bloody hell!
BUFFY: Spike, I need your help. Dawn is... (seeing her) here.
DAWN: Spike was telling a story and he was just at this cool part. Can he finish, please?
BUFFY: What the hell is this? (to Spike) What is she doing here?
DAWN: Just hanging out.
BUFFY: Here?!
DAWN: Just let him finish the story, okay? Then you can do the lecture?
BUFFY: Yeah, okay. Let's hear the story Spike's been telling my little sister.
DAWN: Go on, Spike.
SPIKE: Right. Yeah. So I knew the girl was in the coal bin. I ripped it open -- very violent -- hauled her out of there... and gave her to a good family in a nice home where they were never ever mean to her and didn't lock her in the coal bin.
DAWN: What? That's so lame.
SPIKE: (to Buffy) I was just about to send her home. Knew you'd be fretting.
BUFFY: Dawn, grab your things and let's get outta here.
SPIKE: Ease up. She just wanted a break from the routine. A little rebellion's healthy. Builds character.
BUFFY: I don't want to hear one more word form you.
BUFFY: ...And then to find you enjoying story hour at Spike's crypt... A <u>crypt</u> Dawn! Not some "Hot Dog on a Stick" boot at the mall, but a real live crypt with a real dead vampire. Why doesn't that register with you? Crypt plus vampire equals bad.
DAWN: 'Cause it was Spike?
BUFFY: Spike. Hanging out with Spike is not cool, Dawn. It's dangerous and... icky.
DAWN: I don't think Spike is icky.
BUFFY: Well think again sister, he's...
BUFFY: (realizing) You have a crush on Spike.
DAWN: No, I don't! It's just he's got cool hair and he wears cool leather coats and stuff. And he doesn't treat me like an alien.
BUFFY: (serious) Spike's a killer, Dawn. You cannot have a crush on a thing that's dead and evil and <u>a vampire</u>.
DAWN: Right. That's why you were never with Angel <u>for three years</u>.
BUFFY: Angel was different. He has a soul.
DAWN: Spike has a chip. Same diff. He fights demons too y'know. He told me about some pretty gross fights actually--
BUFFY: Dawn, I don't want to hear this. Spike is a <u>monster</u>. Plus, you're only fourteen years old.
DAWN: I like hanging out with him, is all. And even if I did have a crush, he'd never in a million years notice. Not with you around.
BUFFY: What does that mean.
DAWN: He's totally into you.
BUFFY: (uncomprehending) Heh?
DAWN: Come on. You don't see it? Buffy, Spike's completely in love with you.
XANDER: Tell me again what we're looking for.
BUFFY: (looking around) Clues.
XANDER: Okay. (beat) Can you give me a clue as to what kind of clues?
BUFFY: I don't know. Something. Anything. Just want to make sure this was a vamp attack. And if it was, how many are we talking about?
XANDER: Well, Sunnydale's Finest didn't leave a lot for us to examine.
XANDER: And who knows how many people have traipsed through here already.
BUFFY: Xander...
XANDER: (looks at her) What?
BUFFY: Never mind.
BUFFY: Dawn said that...
XANDER: Yeah?
BUFFY: Forget it.
XANDER: Buffy!
BUFFY: Dawn things... She says that.... Spike might be in love with me.
BUFFY: It's not a joke.
XANDER: Oh I hope not. It's funnier if it's true.
BUFFY: I'm serious. <u>This</u> is serious.
XANDER: Right. Serious big bunches of flowers with little cards attached, "Buffy, Buffy, you're so sweet..." (working it out) "You are... you are good enough to eat."
BUFFY: So you can stop laughing now.
XANDER: I don't think so.
BUFFY: It's creepy.
XANDER: No, not creepy, 'cuz it's not <u>real</u>. I mean, how upset can you really get over Spike's fevered day-dream that's never gonna happen?
BUFFY: I guess.
XANDER: So where did Dawn... How did she come to this... extremely entertaining conclusion?
BUFFY: She was with Spike yesterday afternoon. I think she's got a little crush on him.
XANDER: What?
BUFFY: (musing) I knew he had this weird fixation for me, but--
XANDER: I'm the one she's got a crush on. Me.
BUFFY: Let's go. There's nothing here.
XANDER: It's always been me. Big funny Xander. And then she just suddenly decides I'm not the cool one anymore? Why is that okay?
JOYCE: But they didn't get that it was a copy of bill of lading... they thought it was another order form, so now I've got two shipments of Greek amphorae on my hands...
SPIKE: Funny. And really, how many of them do you need. Amphorae.
JOYCE: Buffy! Spike came over to apologize. (shaking Dawn, teasingly) Our missing child drama.
DAWN: Even though it was so not his fault.
BUFFY: And he just decided to hang for awhile.
JOYCE: Well, I got started talking about the gallery. See, there was this bill of lading...
SPIKE: Oh, don't get us all laughing again, Joyce. Anyhow, I really need to talk to your eldest.
BUFFY: What about?
SPIKE: Got a bit of info you might be keen on knowing.
BUFFY: Sorry. All out of cash. Maybe you should hit on Giles-- hit up Giles--
SPIKE: I got a bead on the guys who killed those people. The ones on the train.
BUFFY: Do tell.
SPIKE: I'll do better than that. I'll show.
SPIKE: (squinting) What's the matter?
BUFFY: Nothing. Just...
SPIKE: Two vamps. Holed up in a warehouse downtown.
BUFFY: Abandoned?
SPIKE: Are there any other kind in this town? (beat) Well, what you waiting for? Grab your coat and pointy sticks.
BUFFY: Hey, uh--
BUFFY: Eeeew.
SPIKE: It's not blood. It's bourbon.
BUFFY: (calmly reiterating) Eeeew.
SPIKE: (a tad defensive) Suit yourself. I wasn't trying to get you sizzled. Thought you might want a warmer, is all.
SPIKE: You like the Ramones?
BUFFY: Where are the bad guys? It's been almost an hour.
SPIKE: Promised location, not timeliness. (beat) Cold night. I could put the heater on if--
BUFFY: I'm fine.
BUFFY: If you're not doing this for money, then why--
SPIKE: (sees something) Shhh.
BUFFY: Them?
SPIKE: Imagine these rotters are tougher than they look. Prob'ly very crafty. And wiry.
SPIKE: (requesting) Stake.
SPIKE: Don't use 'em usually. But for these two, it's best to be prepared.
MUTT: The Slayer.
SPIKE: Well, that was... sad.
SPIKE: I'm embarrassed for our kind. (then) So, should we chase 'em then? Can't have gone far.
BUFFY: Those vamps have been here a while. They've nested.
SPIKE: So, you're saying they're a couple of poofters.
BUFFY: No. I'm saying they had nothing to do with last night's murders.
SPIKE: How do you figure?
BUFFY: Whoever did it only just arrived in town last night.
BUFFY: Looks like you just wasted my time.
BUFFY: What are you--
SPIKE: I... It was... I wasn't thinking...
BUFFY: What is this, Spike?
SPIKE: Don't get your knickers twisted, I was just-
BUFFY: No. I mean, what is <u>this</u>? The late night stake out, the bogus suspects, the flask... Is this a <u>date</u>?
SPIKE: (stammering) A - ? Please... A date. You're completely off your bird. I mean... (quickly/hopeful) Do you want it to be?
BUFFY: Oh no. No... Are you out of your mind?
SPIKE: It's not so unusual. Two people. In the workplace... Feelings develop...
BUFFY: No! Feelings <u>do</u>
<u>not</u> develop. No feelings!
SPIKE: You can't deny it. There's something between us.
BUFFY: Loathing. Disgust-
SPIKE: Heat. Desire-
BUFFY: Please. You're a vampire, Spike!
SPIKE: Angel was a vampire.
BUFFY: Angel had a soul. He was good.
SPIKE: And I can be too. I've changed Buffy.
BUFFY: You mean the chip? That's not change. That's just holding you back. You're like a serial killer in prison-
SPIKE: Women marry them all the time! (quickly/heartfelt) But I'm not. Like that. Something's happening to me. I can't stop thinking about you. And if it means turning my back on the whole evil thing-
BUFFY: (cutting him off) Stop. You don't mean this. You don't even know what... feelings are.
SPIKE: (pained) I damn well do. I lie awake every night.
BUFFY: You sleep during the day.
SPIKE: Yeah, but -- You're missing the point. This is real, here. I lov-
BUFFY: (desperate) DON'T! ...say...don't.
BUFFY: I'm going.
SPIKE: Come on. We need to-
BUFFY: (cutting him off) <u>We</u> don't need to do anything. There is no we. Understand?
SPIKE: Buffy-
SPIKE: Who's there?
DRUSILLA: Look who's come to make everything right again.
SPIKE: So, uh, let me get this straight... Darla got mojo'd back from the beyond, you vamped her, and now you and she are working on turning Angel into his own bad self again.
DRUSILLA: Mm-hmm.
SPIKE: Sounds fun.
DRUSILLA: (smiling) It is. Like lollipops at the circus. (thoughtful) Although... didn't care for Angelus setting us on fire.
SPIKE: And it's got you, what, all nostalgic now, has it?
DRUSILLA: I want us to be a family again, my William. Come back with me.
SPIKE: To Los Angeles? Done the L.A. scene, Dru. Didn't agree with me.
SPIKE: Besides, got a sweet little set-up here in Sunny-D. Decent digs. Not to mention all the tasty townies I can eat.
DRUSILLA: (scolding) Naughty... You needn't make up stories. I already know why you're not coming.
DRUSILLA: Poor boy... Tin soldiers put funny little knickknacks in your brain. Can't hunt. Can't hurt. Can't kill. (disdain) You've got a "chip."
SPIKE: All right. So you heard. Poor Spike's become a cautionary tale for vampires. "Be good, kiddies, or they just might wire you up someday" - and what's this say about you, then, eh? Are you so addicted to torment you'd come all the way from L.A. just to rub a bit of salt in the wound?
DRUSILLA: You misunderstand. I don't come to torture. Well... (smiles) Not you, anyway. You see...
DRUSILLA: I don't believe in science. All those bits and molecules no one's ever seen. I trust eyes and heart alone. And do you know what mine are singing out now?
DRUSILLA: You're a killer.
DRUSILLA: Born to slash and bash and bleed like beautiful poetry. No little tinkertoy ever could stop you from flowing.
SPIKE: (seduced) Yeah... (snaps out of it) But - the pain, love. You don't understand, it's searing, blinding...
DRUSILLA: All in your head.
DRUSILLA: I can see it. Little bit of plastic spiderwebbing out nasty blue shocks - and every one, is a lie. Electricity lies, Spike. It tells you you're not a bad dog. But you are.
DRUSILLA: You're my bad dog and you bite.
SPIKE: (muttering) Oh, bloody hell.
HARMONY: Who is-- (all becoming clear) Oh, wait, I get it. (to Spike) Our little sex game was just the beginning... Now you've gone and picked up some cheap Queen of the Damned to dress up like your precious Droodzilla.
SPIKE: Harmony...
HARMONY: And you better not be thinking what I think you're thinking, 'cause my answer's the same as always... No threesomes unless it's boy-boy-girl. (beat) Or Charlize Theron.
SPIKE: (pointing at Dru) Harmony, you moron, this <u>is</u> Drusilla.
HARMONY: Oh. Well, you've got some nerve showing up like this, after all this time. After breaking my sweet Boo-boo's heart...
HARMONY: Do you have any idea how hard it's been to break down the walls he put up after you left? I mean, serious "trust issues..."
SPIKE: Harm...
HARMONY: And it's no use crawling back to him now, 'cause Spikey don't play that anymore, Morticia--
SPIKE: It was fun while it lasted, Harm, really, but I think it best now if you hit the road.
HARMONY: Why? Because <i>she's</i> back?
SPIKE: No. Because I am.
DRUSILLA: And there you are...
DRUSILLA: My darling, deadly boy.
WILLOW: Oh! Wow!
BUFFY: Yeah.
WILLOW: I mean... Whoa! Ga!
BUFFY: You can stop when you get to "moo."
WILLOW: He actually told you?... He said, "I love you?"
BUFFY: I didn't let him get that far. But I could see the words coming.
JOYCE: Honey, did you, somehow, unintentionally, lead him on in any way? Send him signals?
BUFFY: Well... I do beat him up a lot. (off Joyce's looks) For him, that's like third base.
WILLOW: Buffy, I'm really worried.
JOYCE: So am I. He could become dangerous.
BUFFY: Not really. As long as it's chips ahoy in Spike's head, he can't hurt me or any of you guys. (then) Besides, this'll blow over. I'm sure it's just some weird Spike thing. He'll have the hots for some Gak Demon before we know it.
WILLOW: I don't know. Sometimes these things can get pretty twisted.
JOYCE: And Spike. He's...
BUFFY: Pretty twisted.
WILLOW: You made it clear, right? That it could never happen. That there was no possible way <u>ever</u>.
BUFFY: Yeah. I think so... I don't know. I was kind of thrown.
WILLOW: You have to talk to him again, Buffy.
BUFFY: What? No! I have to <u>avoid</u> him again.
WILLOW: Not until you shut him down completely. If he thinks he has even a little chance with you, there's no telling what he'll do.
JOYCE: I know this is hard, honey, but I think you made the right decision. Better to nip this in the bud before...
BUFFY: The bud nips me?
WILLOW: Buffy, if you want, I can go with. Back you up with some scowlin'...
BUFFY: Thanks, but I think this is something I have to do myself. I mean, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this whole thing's been blown out of proportion and Spike's gone back to wanting me dead.
WILLOW: (crossing her fingers) Here's hoping.
BUFFY: You know what, though? There is something I'd like you to do while I'm gone...
BUFFY: (calling) Spike?
BUFFY: Hello? You here?
SPIKE: See anything interesting?
BUFFY: Spike... What have-- What's happened?
SPIKE: You remember my ex, don't you, Slayer? Came back, she did. Couldn't live without me.
DRUSILLA: My boy's been feeding again...
DRUSILLA: But I know what he really wants to eat.
DRUSILLA: Shall we tie her up and play with her a teensy bit first?
SPIKE: I'm through playing.
DRUSILLA: Oo, I like it when you're all dour and straight-to-business-like. All right, then... (eyeing Buffy) Let's put our little toy away. Back in its box. With posies and pennies for--UUUUhh!
SPIKE: (to himself) Bloody well through playing.
SPIKE: Beginning to think you'd sleep the night away.
BUFFY: Dru... Drusilla...
DRUSILLA: Not nice to change the game in mid-play, Spike... You've taken my chair and the music hasn't stopped.
SPIKE: Sorry, Pet. My house, my rules.
DRUSILLA: (pouting) I think I shall be very cross with you when I'm free again.
BUFFY: What is going on?
SPIKE: Simple... I'm going to prove something...
SPIKE: I love you.
BUFFY: Oh my God...
SPIKE: Look at me! I... LOVE... you. You're all I bloody think about... Dream about... You're in my gut, my throat... I'm drowning in you, Summers. Drowning in--
SPIKE: Can do without the laugh track, Dru.
DRUSILLA: (through her laughter) But it's so funny... I knew... before you did... I knew you loved the Slayer. The pixies in my head whispered it to me... I thought they would fly away...
SPIKE: (to Buffy) You can't tell me there isn't anything there between you and me. I know you feel something.
BUFFY: It's called "revulsion." And whatever you think you're feeling... it's not love. You can't love without a soul.
DRUSILLA: Oh, we can, you know. We can love quite well... (looking at Spike bemused) If not wisely.
SPIKE: (to Buffy) You still don't believe. Still don't think I mean it. You want proof? How's this?
SPIKE: I'm going to kill Drusilla for you.
BUFFY: That's not going to prove anything. Except that you're a miserable, sick vampire I should've dusted a long time ago. And, hey, already there.
SPIKE: Don't mock this.
BUFFY: Go mock yourself.
SPIKE: This is <u>Drusilla</u>, girl. Do you have the slightest idea how much she means to me?
SPIKE: This is the face of my salvation. Before Dru, I was nothing. A speck. But when she bit me, she delivered me from mediocrity. For over a century - we cut a swath through the continents, shared a bed, drank from the same vein...
SPIKE: A hundred years, and she never stopped surprising me... Never stopped taking me to new depths. I was a lucky bloke, to touch such a black beauty. Lucky just to stand in her light...
DRUSILLA: (moved) Tsk. Aww. Oww--
SPIKE: (to Buffy) So you see, it means something.
BUFFY: Not to me. Kill her. Why do I care?
SPIKE: Here's why: If you don't admit that there's something there... Some tiny feeling for me... Then I'll untie Dru and let her kill you , instead.
DRUSILLA: Yes. Please. I like that game much better.
SPIKE: Just... Give me something... a crumb, the barest smidge... tell me someday, maybe, there's a chance...
BUFFY: Spike... The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
SPIKE: GaaaAAAAAAAHHH!
SPIKE: What the bleeding hell is wrong with you bloody women? What the hell does it take? Why do you bitches torture me?
BUFFY: Which question do you want me to answer first?
SPIKE: I'm at the end of my bleeding tether! I don't know why I even bother! (to Dru) It's your fault. You're to blame for all this, you know.
DRUSILLA: Am I?
SPIKE: Bloody right you are. If you hadn't left me for that Chaos Demon, I'd never come back here. Wouldn't have this sodding chip in my skull... (rounding on Buffy) And you... You wouldn't be able to touch me. Because this-- this thing with you -- it's wrong! I know it! Not a complete idiot! (gesturing to his heart) You think I like having you here?! Destroying everything that was me until all that's left is you in a dead shell. You say you hate it but you won't leave. What I should just do is get rid of both of you -- Burn you! Cut you into little pieces! So there won't be any more bints to cock things up for--
SPIKE: Oh... <i>great</i>!
HARMONY: What about me, Spike? Huh? Forget about me again? The <u>actual</u> girlfriend?
HARMONY: I gave you the best... bunch of months... of my life. I did everything to please you. Did you ever once think about <u>my</u> wants? <u>My</u> fantasies?
SPIKE: (through his pain) Um... Not as such, no.
HARMONY: Well they were... deep. And beautiful. And you should have.
DRUSILLA: (to Harm) That's right, little girl. Teach our naughty boy a lesson. Such a disappointment to all of us, he is.
SPIKE: Oh, so now you're all ganging up...
HARMONY: I thought I could change you, Spike. I thought maybe if I gave and gave and gave, you'd come around...
HARMONY: Maybe be a little nicer. Stop treating me like your dog. But now I see it's you! You're the dog...
HARMONY: Who needs to be put down--
HARMONY: Ow! You're on my hair!
DRUSILLA: Hear the pretty music? It's a dirge I think... For your funeral... (a quizzical look) But it's not here...
DRUSILLA: Poor Spike... So lost. Even I can't help you now.
HARMONY: And you can say goodbye to this... (pointing to her ass) 'Cause you're not gonna see it anymore.
HARMONY: Unless you run into me somewhere and... and it's me walking away from you.
HARMONY: But even then, I'll probably just... you know, back away.
SPIKE: Buffy...
SPIKE: Come on now - stop. You can't walk away from this.
BUFFY: (not turning around) What part of punching you in the face did you not understand?
SPIKE: Se we had a fight. Not our first, love. It doesn't have to change anything-
BUFFY: This changes everything. You're out, Spike. I want you out of this town. I want you off this planet. You don't ever come near me, my friends and family again. Ever - understand?
SPIKE: No. It's not that easy. We have something, Buffy. It's not pretty, but it's real.
SPIKE: And there's nothing either one of us can do about it. Like it or not, I'm in your life. You can't just shut me out.
