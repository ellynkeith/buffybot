Jacking up the bar prices to pay for fixin' up this sinkhole. Not my fault their insurance doesn't cover Act of Troll.
Got half a mind to. 'Specially since the flowering onion got remodeled right off the sodding menu. Only thing this place 'ad going for it... 'Course I have spotted some walnutty muffin tops that--
What you mean, what am I--?
Well... Saw you sittin' alone. Thought... I dunno, you could, maybe, do with a bit of, you know, company.
Suit yourself.
Just... I mean... we took on that Glory chippee together. I was right there with you, fighting the fight...
Still. Points for intent. You'd think that'd be enough to cut me a sliver of slack. Earn me a little consideration, respect--
Bugger it.
And you're saying I didn't?
And you're making it into very hard work.
(distracted) Yeah? Like you could ever hurt me...
Not tired.
Harm! Really not in the mood right now.
Like what? You stop yammering for two seconds?
Oh, it's you. What are you doing lurking about?
Nothing.
No! Why are-- Does Buffy know you're here?
Go home then.
Well, you can't bloody well stay here.
Because! I've got things to do. (off her look) Things... Bad things. Bad, evil things. That are not for a child's eyes.
Well, originally, I <u>was</u>. I got over it. Doesn't seem to me it matters very much how you start out.
Just trying to keep you safe, I expect.
Take that back.
(taking interest) She... She does?
Really.
So... what else does Buffy say about me?
Well, I had hubby by the throat, didn't I? Promised her he'd live if she did the invite.
What do you think?
Too much for you?
Well, I went into the house. Lady was there with a couple teenaged sons. Little older than you. I killed 'em right quick, the whole lot. But... someone was missing. There was supposed to be a little girl. So I got real quiet.
(very soft) And I hear this tiny noise coming from the coal bin... this little sigh... so I listened harder... it's very, very quiet...
Bloody hell!
Right. Yeah. So I knew the girl was in the coal bin. I ripped it open -- very violent -- hauled her out of there... and gave her to a good family in a nice home where they were never ever mean to her and didn't lock her in the coal bin.
(to Buffy) I was just about to send her home. Knew you'd be fretting.
Ease up. She just wanted a break from the routine. A little rebellion's healthy. Builds character.
Funny. And really, how many of them do you need. Amphorae.
Oh, don't get us all laughing again, Joyce. Anyhow, I really need to talk to your eldest.
Got a bit of info you might be keen on knowing.
I got a bead on the guys who killed those people. The ones on the train.
I'll do better than that. I'll show.
(squinting) What's the matter?
Two vamps. Holed up in a warehouse downtown.
Are there any other kind in this town? (beat) Well, what you waiting for? Grab your coat and pointy sticks.
It's not blood. It's bourbon.
(a tad defensive) Suit yourself. I wasn't trying to get you sizzled. Thought you might want a warmer, is all.
You like the Ramones?
Promised location, not timeliness. (beat) Cold night. I could put the heater on if--
(sees something) Shhh.
Imagine these rotters are tougher than they look. Prob'ly very crafty. And wiry.
(requesting) Stake.
Don't use 'em usually. But for these two, it's best to be prepared.
Well, that was... sad.
I'm embarrassed for our kind. (then) So, should we chase 'em then? Can't have gone far.
So, you're saying they're a couple of poofters.
How do you figure?
I... It was... I wasn't thinking...
Don't get your knickers twisted, I was just-
(stammering) A - ? Please... A date. You're completely off your bird. I mean... (quickly/hopeful) Do you want it to be?
It's not so unusual. Two people. In the workplace... Feelings develop...
You can't deny it. There's something between us.
Heat. Desire-
Angel was a vampire.
And I can be too. I've changed Buffy.
Women marry them all the time! (quickly/heartfelt) But I'm not. Like that. Something's happening to me. I can't stop thinking about you. And if it means turning my back on the whole evil thing-
(pained) I damn well do. I lie awake every night.
Yeah, but -- You're missing the point. This is real, here. I lov-
Come on. We need to-
Buffy-
Who's there?
So, uh, let me get this straight... Darla got mojo'd back from the beyond, you vamped her, and now you and she are working on turning Angel into his own bad self again.
Sounds fun.
And it's got you, what, all nostalgic now, has it?
To Los Angeles? Done the L.A. scene, Dru. Didn't agree with me.
Besides, got a sweet little set-up here in Sunny-D. Decent digs. Not to mention all the tasty townies I can eat.
All right. So you heard. Poor Spike's become a cautionary tale for vampires. "Be good, kiddies, or they just might wire you up someday" - and what's this say about you, then, eh? Are you so addicted to torment you'd come all the way from L.A. just to rub a bit of salt in the wound?
(seduced) Yeah... (snaps out of it) But - the pain, love. You don't understand, it's searing, blinding...
(muttering) Oh, bloody hell.
Harmony...
(pointing at Dru) Harmony, you moron, this <u>is</u> Drusilla.
Harm...
It was fun while it lasted, Harm, really, but I think it best now if you hit the road.
No. Because I am.
See anything interesting?
You remember my ex, don't you, Slayer? Came back, she did. Couldn't live without me.
I'm through playing.
(to himself) Bloody well through playing.
Beginning to think you'd sleep the night away.
Sorry, Pet. My house, my rules.
Simple... I'm going to prove something...
I love you.
Look at me! I... LOVE... you. You're all I bloody think about... Dream about... You're in my gut, my throat... I'm drowning in you, Summers. Drowning in--
Can do without the laugh track, Dru.
(to Buffy) You can't tell me there isn't anything there between you and me. I know you feel something.
(to Buffy) You still don't believe. Still don't think I mean it. You want proof? How's this?
I'm going to kill Drusilla for you.
Don't mock this.
This is <u>Drusilla</u>, girl. Do you have the slightest idea how much she means to me?
This is the face of my salvation. Before Dru, I was nothing. A speck. But when she bit me, she delivered me from mediocrity. For over a century - we cut a swath through the continents, shared a bed, drank from the same vein...
A hundred years, and she never stopped surprising me... Never stopped taking me to new depths. I was a lucky bloke, to touch such a black beauty. Lucky just to stand in her light...
(to Buffy) So you see, it means something.
Here's why: If you don't admit that there's something there... Some tiny feeling for me... Then I'll untie Dru and let her kill you , instead.
Just... Give me something... a crumb, the barest smidge... tell me someday, maybe, there's a chance...
GaaaAAAAAAAHHH!
What the bleeding hell is wrong with you bloody women? What the hell does it take? Why do you bitches torture me?
I'm at the end of my bleeding tether! I don't know why I even bother! (to Dru) It's your fault. You're to blame for all this, you know.
Bloody right you are. If you hadn't left me for that Chaos Demon, I'd never come back here. Wouldn't have this sodding chip in my skull... (rounding on Buffy) And you... You wouldn't be able to touch me. Because this-- this thing with you -- it's wrong! I know it! Not a complete idiot! (gesturing to his heart) You think I like having you here?! Destroying everything that was me until all that's left is you in a dead shell. You say you hate it but you won't leave. What I should just do is get rid of both of you -- Burn you! Cut you into little pieces! So there won't be any more bints to cock things up for--
Oh... <i>great</i>!
(through his pain) Um... Not as such, no.
Oh, so now you're all ganging up...
Buffy...
Come on now - stop. You can't walk away from this.
Se we had a fight. Not our first, love. It doesn't have to change anything-
No. It's not that easy. We have something, Buffy. It's not pretty, but it's real.
And there's nothing either one of us can do about it. Like it or not, I'm in your life. You can't just shut me out.
