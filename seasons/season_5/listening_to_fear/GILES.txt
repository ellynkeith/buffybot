My god, a rough night.
Yes, that was disappointing. Things  would've been much easier with him here.
I suppose he just forgot.
Well, in all fairness, we don't really  know about the "slithered" part.
Perhaps we should explore a little  further. Head into the woods a bit ...
Much better idea.
You'll call us if you need help?

Because it's a killer snot monster from <u>outer</u> <u>space</u>. (catching himself) I did not say that. What I said was,  there are demons who approach our  world in all sorts of different ways.  This one came from above ...
Well, then. It would appear the world's  not being invaded.

Right. Like the Black Plague.
So perhaps something emerged from those meteors and killed the madmen.
No, but we'd better call Riley.
