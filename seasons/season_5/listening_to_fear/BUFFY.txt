Are you kidding me? This is the good  life. Relaxing in bed while people  bring you food on trays--
(mouth full) Mmm. Good 'n wiggly.
(deadpan, to Joyce) You're the one who insisted on teaching her to talk.
Just keeping her company.
Waiting? Gimme a break- We've got tons to do-
Ooh, and an adjustable bed to fiddle  with. That alone'll keep me going for  the next four hours or so.
Not tonight. Tonight I have Mom  taking-care-of to do. Besides, Riley  is filling in for me with the others.  I'm sure they've got everything under  control.
Headache?
You got her a book of spells. The girl  who can break things by looking at  them now has a book to teach her  how to, you know... break things by  looking at them.
Homework? Ugh. I don't believe in tiny  Jewish Santa anymore.
Will. Thank you. But to tell you the  truth, school is just about the last thing  on my mind right now.
I mean, I don't even know if I'll take that exam.
Mom?
Okay. We'll be right outside if you  need us.
It's okay. The doctor warned me about  it. I should've told you. It's just the...  it's the thing in her brain, it sort of...  presses on something and it can make  her say weird things.
Not really. I guess it's sort of like a flash.  You saw, the second after she said it, she  was normal.
Hey, Santa doesn't lie.
Excuse me.
Come on, Dawn. It's okay.
I don't think so. It's different. Don't worry about it.
And, yeah, the crazy guy was a little bit,  you know... crazy. But it's okay now.  Are they really sending him home?
(quickly) Just babbling.
I'm sure they heard you, Mom.
I'm sure someone's on the way--the push- buttons at crosswalks aren't hooked to  anything?
Doctor--
Dr. Kriegel, we want to go home.
No. We, meaning all of us. My mom too.
Um. Hey, Dawn? You wanna get a soda from the machine?
Listen, Dr. Kriegel, I don't see why we can't take Mom home until the...thing. I mean, wouldn't it maybe be good to let her rest where she feels, you know, safe and comfortable?
(quickly) I can do it. Anything.
I'm not really a sleep-person anyway.
Mom, wait, I need the stuff... the  medicine, and instructions how to  do everything.
Right. (unsure) I remember ...
No, no. I've got it. And I really appre-
(to Dr. Kriegel) She's... I told you she's beenâ€¦
Okay, Mom--
Okay, hey, don't worry. Dawn, turn  off the lights down here. I'll take Mom upstairs.
(to Joyce) We'll turn off the lights up there, too.
Here we go. It's okay now.
(calling) Mom?
Mom, what are you--
Mom- -
It's okay.
You need to rest. Let's just get you back to bed.
Here Mom, these will help you sleep.
There we go.
Mom, it's Dawn.
(gently) She's... tired, Mom. We all are. You  get some rest. I'll check on you in a bit.
No--
She loves you. She's just not herself.  I told you what the doctor said. It's the  tumor. She--
You mean that man in the hospital.
(reassuring) Nothing. It's not you. It's ... It's just ...  I think there's something that happens in  people's brains when there's something  wrong. Like a... short circuit. And... it  makes them feel like nothing's real except  them. That's all it is.
My--?
Dawn. I was... It was stupid. I was  upset. About Mom. And I was tired and-- (evenly) Look... It's not you. So, if anyone says  anything like that again -- including  me -- don't listen. Okay? Even if it's Mom.
I know. Just don't listen.
Dawn?
What is it?
Spike.
(cold) What the hell are you doing in my house?
You were stealing?
Wait. Are those pictures of-
It's gone. I killed it.
I promise. Everything's alright. Everything's alright ...
Um hum?
You got it.
It's not important.
What, Mom? It's okay.
No.
Yes. She does.
(cutting her off) Mom-
I promise.
