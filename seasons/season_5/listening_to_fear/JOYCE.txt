Listen, you two, I know this creamed  spinach is pretty delicious, but I promise  I won't be offended if you go out and  get some real food.---
Help yourself. There's something  about a food that moves all by  itself that gives me the heebie-jeebies.
Oh hello, Dr. Kriegel. You've met my girls, Buffy and Dawn.
Don't worry about that. I woke up  exhausted, there's really no more  exhausted to get.
I think they have me scheduled for  volleyball, but I'll work around it.
The day after tomorrow? I don't know if  I can stand to be stuck here for two more  days just waiting.
Now Buffy, I really don't need you to  stay here all night. I know you've got  patrolling to do.
It's perfect. Thank you, Willow. You're so sweet.
A little one. A biggish little one.
I'm fine. Now go on, what else is in that sack of goodies, Willow?
(loudly)  I'd rip it in half and then put it in bed with me.
I think I'll take a rest now.
This thing doesn't work! It isn't working!
I bet it's not even hooked to anything.  Like those push-buttons at the crosswalks  that are s'posed to make the signal change.
Tell him, Buffy. Tell him, okay?
I can't, I can't wait here two days before  the operation. I just can't... It makes my  head hurt to be here, can't you tell that?
No reason to get upset?! Oh, right, sorry,  I must just think there is because of my  <u>brain tumor</u>!
I'm sorry I said that. I'm just so tired.
Oh thank God.
Let's go now. Can we go now?
(to Buffy; harsh) You look like your father when he cries.
Yes. Yes, thank you. Thanks for all your help, Doctor.
Thank you. (to the girls, with a smile) Let's get the hell out of here.
It's nice to be home.
Oh that light. (beginning to panic) Oh, Buffy no, it's too bright. It's too  bright! It's too bright!
Buffy it hurts, it hurts! It hurts my eyes!
Okay.
I'm making breakfast. (to Buffy) But you shouldn't eat anymore. You're disgustingly fat.
(disturbed) Buffy...I - I don't know what I'm doing.
(starting to panic) Oh God, I'm-- I didn't mean to... I don't know what's happening to me.
(to Dawn; harshly) Don't touch me, you-- you thing!
(snapping) Get away from me! You're nothing! You're  a shadow! I don't know what you are or how  you got here.
(concerned) Dawn, honey, what's wrong?
I wish... I wish someone had bothered to  tell me ... because I didn't know there'd be  tennis being played, I just didn't know...  oh, why? Those eyes, they're like gasoline  puddles ... tell me because I need to know ...  why, why are you staring at me? I wish  I knew...
No...don't do that! Stop! Stop staring! I  don't like that. I have to rest now. I don't  like the way you're looking at me...
It's on me! Help me! There's a bug!
Make it stop looking at me Buffy...  it chokes me ...
It's okay, my baby. It's okay.
Oh, God...
Buffy?
Iâ€¦
I want to ask you something... And if I'm  being crazy - you just tell me. Okay?
The other day... Actually, I'm not sure  when. The days all seem to bleed  together ...
No, I guess it isn't. I do know I was  pretty out of it. And I had - not a  dream exactly. More like, I had this  knowledge. It just came to me - like  truth, you know? Even though it didn't  seem possible. Even though I shouldn't  think such things.
That Dawn... (pained) She's not mine, is she?
She's - she does belong to us though.
And she's important. To the world.  Precious ...
As precious as you are to me?
Then we have to take care of her.  Promise me, Buffy - if anything  happens to me, if I don't come through this-
No. Let me finish. No matter what  she is, she still feels like my daughter,  and I have to know you'll keep her safe.  You'll love her like I love you.
Good. Good...
My sweet, brave Buffy. What would I do without you?
