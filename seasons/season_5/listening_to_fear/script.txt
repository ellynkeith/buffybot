JOYCE: Listen, you two, I know this creamed  spinach is pretty delicious, but I promise  I won't be offended if you go out and  get some real food.---
BUFFY: Are you kidding me? This is the good  life. Relaxing in bed while people  bring you food on trays--
DAWN: And I like the Jell-O.
JOYCE: Help yourself. There's something  about a food that moves all by  itself that gives me the heebie-jeebies.
BUFFY: (mouth full) Mmm. Good 'n wiggly.
DAWN: This girl at school? She told me that  gelatin is made from ground-up cow's feet and that every time you eat Jell-O  there's some cow out there limping  around without any feet. But I told  her that I'm sure the cow is dead  before they cut its feet off, right?
BUFFY: (deadpan, to Joyce) You're the one who insisted on teaching her to talk.
JOYCE: Oh hello, Dr. Kriegel. You've met my girls, Buffy and Dawn.
KRIEGEL: Yes, of course. You two are becoming  part of the regular crew around here.
BUFFY: Just keeping her company.
KRIEGEL: Good for you. Just be careful you don't wear her out.
JOYCE: Don't worry about that. I woke up  exhausted, there's really no more  exhausted to get.
KRIEGEL: Well, maybe some good news will  help. The bloodwork has come back  from the lab and everything seems fine.  So, we've gone ahead and scheduled  your surgery for the day after  tomorrow at ten in the a.m. How does  that sound to you?
JOYCE: I think they have me scheduled for  volleyball, but I'll work around it.
KRIEGEL: Alright then. Joyce, you take care.  Make sure to get some good solid rest.  And I mean that.
JOYCE: The day after tomorrow? I don't know if  I can stand to be stuck here for two more  days just waiting.
BUFFY: Waiting? Gimme a break- We've got tons to do-
DAWN: Yeah, we've got soap operas to watch  and trashy magazines to read ...
BUFFY: Ooh, and an adjustable bed to fiddle  with. That alone'll keep me going for  the next four hours or so.
JOYCE: Now Buffy, I really don't need you to  stay here all night. I know you've got  patrolling to do.
BUFFY: Not tonight. Tonight I have Mom  taking-care-of to do. Besides, Riley  is filling in for me with the others.  I'm sure they've got everything under  control.
XANDER: Hey! Human chest! Human chest!
GILES: Sorry.
GILES: My god, a rough night.
WILLOW: Whoa, I did two of 'em! Yay on me!  Pretty cool except for the part where I  was really terrified and now my knees  are all dizzy.
XANDER: Not so much a big success-night for me,  but I think I should get points just for  showing up. Unlike some Riley Finns  who shall remain unnamed.
GILES: Yes, that was disappointing. Things  would've been much easier with him here.
WILLOW: Oh piffle. Who needs him when I'm slaying two at a time-- woops!
WILLOW: Okay, it might have been good if he'd showed.
GILES: I suppose he just forgot.
WILLOW: Care package! Special delivery for  the Summers girls.
WILLOW: Now let's see what I have in this sack  of mine...Oh, I feel just like Santa Claus.  Except thinner, and younger, and female,  and well, Jewish.
DAWN: What's that, a vacuum cleaner?
WILLOW: Hey, watch it, Missy, or it's coal in  the socks for you. This is something  extra-special for your mother. 'Cause  I knew she would need a ...
WILLOW: Beer hat! See, it's got cup holders and  straws that go straight to your mouth and  you can fill it with other things than beer...  and somehow when I was in the store this  seemed like the most important idea and  now there's this whole part where I'm crazy...
JOYCE: It's perfect. Thank you, Willow. You're so sweet.
WILLOW: Let me see, who's next? Dawn, I believe  I have something in here for you.
BUFFY: Headache?
JOYCE: A little one. A biggish little one.
JOYCE: I'm fine. Now go on, what else is in that sack of goodies, Willow?
WILLOW: Alright. Dawn, to keep you busy ...
DAWN: Spells! Wow, cool. Thanks Willow.
BUFFY: You got her a book of spells. The girl  who can break things by looking at  them now has a book to teach her  how to, you know... break things by  looking at them.
WILLOW: It doesn't actually have the spells. It's  just history, anecdotes, stuff like that.  Oh Buffy. Here. I have this for you.
BUFFY: Homework? Ugh. I don't believe in tiny  Jewish Santa anymore.
WILLOW: And a yo-yo.
WILLOW: (re: the textbook) The book is just in case you get a chance  to look it over. We're doing World War  One now. The last exam was really pretty  easy, all underlying causes and trench foot.  It should be no hassle to make up--
BUFFY: Will. Thank you. But to tell you the  truth, school is just about the last thing  on my mind right now.
WILLOW: I know.
BUFFY: I mean, I don't even know if I'll take that exam.
JOYCE: (loudly)  I'd rip it in half and then put it in bed with me.
BUFFY: Mom?
JOYCE: I think I'll take a rest now.
BUFFY: Okay. We'll be right outside if you  need us.
WILLOW: She seems... She's gonna be fine.
DAWN: What was she talking about? I mean, that was weird.
BUFFY: It's okay. The doctor warned me about  it. I should've told you. It's just the...  it's the thing in her brain, it sort of...  presses on something and it can make  her say weird things.
DAWN: Does she know she's saying it?
BUFFY: Not really. I guess it's sort of like a flash.  You saw, the second after she said it, she  was normal.
WILLOW: And after the operation... no more pressing...  all normal, all the time.
DAWN: (to Buffy) Is that right?
BUFFY: Hey, Santa doesn't lie.
BUFFY: Excuse me.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: Careful. The facts say a picnic is in order.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: (scared) What is this thing? There's no facts...  no pictures on this one.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: There... what is the data? 'Cause there's  no one in there--
DAWN: Buffy?
BUFFY: Come on, Dawn. It's okay.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: I'm going home. Home, home, home.
DAWN: What's wrong with him? Is it like Mom? A thing in his head?
BUFFY: I don't think so. It's different. Don't worry about it.
BEN: I guess I missed that. Was he bothering you?
WILLOW: Hi.
BEN: Hi.
BUFFY: And, yeah, the crazy guy was a little bit,  you know... crazy. But it's okay now.  Are they really sending him home?
BEN: Don't get me started. The Mental  Ward's booked way past capacity at  this point. Literally nowhere to put 'em.  So the ones with families, they're sending  'em home. Like that guy's family's s'posed  to be able to take care of him? He needs  someone to watch him twenty-four seven. (then) What was he saying to you anyway?
BUFFY: (quickly) Just babbling.
WILLOW: You know what's weird?
TARA: Japanese commercials are weird.
WILLOW: Yes. And also... you know some of  the stars we're looking at don't even  exist anymore? In the time it takes  for their light to get to us, they've  died, exploded, poof.
TARA: Were, um... were things rough at  the hospital?
WILLOW: I used to love to look up at them when  I was little. They're supposed to make  you feel all insignificant but they made  me feel like ... like I was in space. Part of the stars. (points) There's Canis Minor. (points) Cassiopia.
TARA: (points) The Big Pineapple.
WILLOW: Um... you know... not sure I remember that one.
TARA: Oh, it's a major one. See those three bright stars right there?
WILLOW: Yeah...
TARA: And see those stars along there?  That's the bottom of the pineapple.
WILLOW: It's big.
TARA: Hence the name. (then) The real ones never made sense to me. I sorta have my own.
WILLOW: Teach me.
TARA: See those stars over there? 'Cow With  Three Udders'. And that's 'Moose  Getting a Sponge Bath,' 'The Short Man  Looking Uncomfortable'. 'The Little  Pile 0' Crackers' ... That one's a bit of  a stretch. You do it. What would you  call that one?
WILLOW: Hmm... I see ...
WILLOW: A huge flaming meteor about to crash into something.
NIGHTWATCHMAN: I said I won't go away far. A person's  got to trust a man when the facts say  a man's got to get some fresh air and  fresh space and he needs to walk to  get where's he's going.
JOYCE: This thing doesn't work! It isn't working!
BUFFY: I'm sure they heard you, Mom.
JOYCE: I bet it's not even hooked to anything.  Like those push-buttons at the crosswalks  that are s'posed to make the signal change.
BUFFY: I'm sure someone's on the way--the push- buttons at crosswalks aren't hooked to  anything?
BUFFY: Doctor--
JOYCE: Tell him, Buffy. Tell him, okay?
BUFFY: Dr. Kriegel, we want to go home.
KRIEGEL: Well, of course. You can come back  and visit your mother first thing in the  morning.
BUFFY: No. We, meaning all of us. My mom too.
KRIEGEL: Oh, well, I understand that. But it's not  necessarily the first thing I'd recommend--
JOYCE: I can't, I can't wait here two days before  the operation. I just can't... It makes my  head hurt to be here, can't you tell that?
KRIEGEL: Joyce, there's no reason to get upset--
JOYCE: No reason to get upset?! Oh, right, sorry,  I must just think there is because of my  <u>brain tumor</u>!
BUFFY: Um. Hey, Dawn? You wanna get a soda from the machine?
JOYCE: I'm sorry I said that. I'm just so tired.
BUFFY: Listen, Dr. Kriegel, I don't see why we can't take Mom home until the...thing. I mean, wouldn't it maybe be good to let her rest where she feels, you know, safe and comfortable?
KRIEGEL: Even if it would mean some work for you? Taking care of her.
JOYCE: Oh thank God.
BUFFY: (quickly) I can do it. Anything.
KRIEGEL: There are medications to administer, I'd  have to go over those with you. And  I'd need you to check her vitals, watch  her pretty closely... I'm afraid you won't  get a lot of sleep.
BUFFY: I'm not really a sleep-person anyway.
JOYCE: Let's go now. Can we go now?
BUFFY: Mom, wait, I need the stuff... the  medicine, and instructions how to  do everything.
KRIEGEL: (to Joyce) She's right. Let's do this right. We don't want to forget anything.
RILEY: Everyone stay close. (to Xander) Glad you called me in on this.
XANDER: (pointedly) Glad you answered.
RILEY: Oh, yeah. Sorry 'bout last time. Heard I missed out on some fun.
XANDER: Oh yeah, fun was had. Also frolic,  merriment and near-death hijinks.
RILEY: There, look. There it is.
TARA: Wow.
WILLOW: We have meteorite.
ANYA: Is it hot? 'Cause if there's radiation  you'll go all sterile.
RILEY: It's not hot. It's... broken. And... sort of...
WILLOW: Hollow. It's hollow.
ANYA: So we're all thinking the same thing, right?
XANDER: Festive pinata, delicious candy?
WILLOW: Something evil-crashed to earth in this.  Then it broke out and slithered away to  do badness.
GILES: Well, in all fairness, we don't really  know about the "slithered" part.
ANYA: No, no, I'm sure it frisked about like a fluffy lamb.
TARA: Let's look around.
TARA: Maybe we can figure out where it went.
RILEY: No pulse.
ANYA: Yup. The space lamb got 'im.
XANDER: I don't see any marks on him.
WILLOW: I know him! He was at the hospital,  a mental patient. They released him  today.
RILEY: I'm not sure. There's something…
TARA: Yuck.
RILEY: It might be toxic, don't touch it.
XANDER: Oh yeah, touching it was my first impulse.  Luckily I've moved on to my second,  which involves dry heaving and running  like hell. Oh man, does that smell.
ANYA: What do we do now?
WILLOW: Well, we can't call Buffy. (a beat) I want to call Buffy.
TARA: We can't. She's got... life stuff.  That has to come first.
WILLOW: (determined) So we'll figure this out ourselves.  We're experienced.
ANYA: Yes. It seems like we're always dealing  with creatures from outer space except  that we don't ever do that.
RILEY: (almost to himself) This is definitely new territory.
GILES: Perhaps we should explore a little  further. Head into the woods a bit ...
XANDER: Who votes research?
GILES: Much better idea.
RILEY: Yeah, I think that's a good call. There  could have been some other cases like  this. And see if any more of these  were reported in town. I'm gonna  stay here, examine the body some  more, look around a little.
XANDER: Don't do anything hunterly ...
RILEY: No, no. I'm just not great at research,  which I'm pretty sure you guys have  noticed. I like me a good crime scene.
GILES: You'll call us if you need help?
RILEY: Believe me, something jumps out at me  in the dark... you'll hear me even without  the phone. Now, you guys go get that info,  okay? Call me if you find anything.
WILLOW: Okay. You got it.
PATIENT: Cold. Cold.
PATIENT: Wait! You can't go. Don't you be that  kind of barn owl...Please don't go --
PATIENT: (whispered) No, no, no ...
PATIENT: (whispered) I can't see you, I can't see you.
KRIEGEL: Well, I guess we're all set then. You've  got my phone number, pager number ...  And here ...
KRIEGEL: Those are the medications I talked to you  about. The sedative and so forth. Pain killers ...
BUFFY: Right. (unsure) I remember ...
KRIEGEL: If this is going to be too much for you, we can make your mom perfectly comfortable here ...
BUFFY: No, no. I've got it. And I really appre-
JOYCE: (to Buffy; harsh) You look like your father when he cries.
BUFFY: (to Dr. Kriegel) She's... I told you she's been…
KRIEGEL: I know.
KRIEGEL: Joyce? Joyce.
KRIEGEL: We're done here. Why don't you take  your girls home now?
JOYCE: Yes. Yes, thank you. Thanks for all your help, Doctor.
KRIEGEL: I'll see you in a couple of days.
JOYCE: Thank you. (to the girls, with a smile) Let's get the hell out of here.
JOYCE: It's nice to be home.
DAWN: Do you want to get in bed, Mom?
JOYCE: Oh that light. (beginning to panic) Oh, Buffy no, it's too bright. It's too  bright! It's too bright!
BUFFY: Okay, Mom--
JOYCE: Buffy it hurts, it hurts! It hurts my eyes!
BUFFY: Okay, hey, don't worry. Dawn, turn  off the lights down here. I'll take Mom upstairs.
DAWN: Sure.
BUFFY: (to Joyce) We'll turn off the lights up there, too.
JOYCE: Okay.
BUFFY: Here we go. It's okay now.
ELLIS: You Finn?
RILEY: Yeah.
ELLIS: Major Ellis. I'm in charge of this Op.  What's the situation? Just the one civilian casualty?
RILEY: That I know of. Over here.
GRAHAM: (sotto; ribbing him) Found a stiff in the woods and called  us in. Don't you usually call your  girlfriend for this kind of thing?
GRAHAM: Okay, okay ...
RILEY: I wouldn't touch that stuff in his mouth if I were you.
ELLIS: Toxic?
RILEY: No. Just messy.
RILEY: Don't think it's toxic. Guy seems to have  simply choked on the stuff. Near as I can  tell, it's some kind of protein alkaloid.
ELLIS: This fit the profile of any Sub-T you're familiar with?
RILEY: Not a sub-terrestrial, Major. <u>Extra</u>-terrestrial. (pointing) Came out of that.
ELLIS: (eyeing the vial, to Graham) Miller, set trackers for a protein  signature.
GRAHAM: Yes, sir--
RILEY: No good, Major. This alkaloid's breaking  down at an accelerated rate. It's dissolving  too fast to track.
ELLIS: You got a better idea?
RILEY: Thing came from space... there's gotta  be some trace radiation.
ELLIS: We have Geiger counters in the packs.
RILEY: Shouldn't be too much background gamma noise out here.
ELLIS: (to his men) Break 'em out.
DAWN: What - -
BUFFY: (calling) Mom?
BUFFY: Mom, what are you--
JOYCE: I'm making breakfast. (to Buffy) But you shouldn't eat anymore. You're disgustingly fat.
BUFFY: Mom- -
JOYCE: (disturbed) Buffy...I - I don't know what I'm doing.
BUFFY: It's okay.
JOYCE: (starting to panic) Oh God, I'm-- I didn't mean to... I don't know what's happening to me.
BUFFY: You need to rest. Let's just get you back to bed.
BUFFY: Here Mom, these will help you sleep.
BUFFY: There we go.
JOYCE: (to Dawn; harshly) Don't touch me, you-- you thing!
DAWN: M-Mom, please--
JOYCE: (snapping) Get away from me! You're nothing! You're  a shadow! I don't know what you are or how  you got here.
BUFFY: Mom, it's Dawn.
JOYCE: (concerned) Dawn, honey, what's wrong?
BUFFY: (gently) She's... tired, Mom. We all are. You  get some rest. I'll check on you in a bit.
DAWN: She hates me ...
BUFFY: No--
DAWN: She-- she called me a thing.
BUFFY: She loves you. She's just not herself.  I told you what the doctor said. It's the  tumor. She--
DAWN: No, not just Mom. People. They keep  saying stuff like that... about me.
BUFFY: You mean that man in the hospital.
DAWN: He-- He called me "a thing," too. And  there was another one. A weird guy,  outside the magic shop. Said I didn't  belong... I wasn't real ...
DAWN: Why does everybody keep doing that? What's wrong with me?
BUFFY: (reassuring) Nothing. It's not you. It's ... It's just ...  I think there's something that happens in  people's brains when there's something  wrong. Like a... short circuit. And... it  makes them feel like nothing's real except  them. That's all it is.
DAWN: So, what's wrong with <u>your</u> brain?
BUFFY: My--?
DAWN: You said stuff, too. Said I-- I wasn't  your sister--
BUFFY: Dawn. I was... It was stupid. I was  upset. About Mom. And I was tired and-- (evenly) Look... It's not you. So, if anyone says  anything like that again -- including  me -- don't listen. Okay? Even if it's Mom.
DAWN: I hate it.
BUFFY: I know. Just don't listen.
XANDER: Look how teeny Mercury is, compared to,  like, Saturn. Whereas in contrast, the cars  of the same name--
GILES: Xander. Please. We've work to do.
XANDER: I still don't get why we came here to get  info about a killer snot monster.
GILES: Because it's a killer snot monster from <u>outer</u> <u>space</u>. (catching himself) I did not say that. What I said was,  there are demons who approach our  world in all sorts of different ways.  This one came from above ...
XANDER: And the university library's astronomy  section is the home of aboveness... got it.  Loving the study materials, too ...
TARA: We've scoured all the International  periodicals for any other meteorite  landings in the last week.
ANYA: Big zippo.
GILES: Well, then. It would appear the world's  not being invaded.
TARA: I'm very pleased about that.
WILLOW: I've got some stuff. (reading off screen) The most recent meteoric anomaly was the Tunguska blast in Russia back in 1917. Some witnesses claimed the meteor was hollow.
XANDER: Hmm... maybe with a chewy demon center like ours.
GILES: How far back does this list of anomalies go?
WILLOW: Pretty far. Back to the Queller Impact in the twelfth century.
TARA: The what?
WILLOW: Queller. I don't know why it's called that,  it didn't hit a place called Queller or anything.  It landed just outside Reykjavik in Iceland.
XANDER: Wait. I just saw… Quell ... Queller ...
XANDER: Here. "Primitive people used to believe  that the moon was a cause of insanity.  Sometimes they would pray to the moon  to send them a special meteor to fix the  problem the moon had caused. These  meteors were expected to '<u>quell</u> the madmen'"
ANYA: Nicely read, honey.
GILES: Oh come, it's more likely to be named after someone called Queller.
TARA: The man in the woods. He was a mental patient.
XANDER: And he got pretty well quelled.
WILLOW: Okay, I'm looking in history now. (a beat, then) It says here in the middle ages there were these sweeping plagues.
GILES: Right. Like the Black Plague.
WILLOW: No, these were different. More like  plagues of madness. People were  losing their marbles everywhere but  then it would suddenly subside...  and some of these dates look pretty  close... like maybe it happened after  each one of the meteor events ...
GILES: So perhaps something emerged from those meteors and killed the madmen.
XANDER: Seems like that's what happened here.  Meteor goes boom, crazy guy goes  bye-bye.
TARA: Xander's little book made it sound like  this Queller thing had to be summoned.  So who summoned it?
XANDER: Who else? My money's on Glory. our resident beastie summoner.
WILLOW: We should call Buffy. Except we can't call Buffy. (to Giles) Can we?
GILES: No, but we'd better call Riley.
RILEY: A Queller demon?
WILLOW: Yep. That's our perp. It's a sort of a  scavenger that can be summoned to kill--
WILLOW: Yeah. How did you--
RILEY: 'Cause I got five corpses here in the mental ward at Sunnydale Memorial.
WILLOW: You're at the hospital? Riley, listen... I  saw Buffy's mom before and she was  acting kind of wacky. Insane wacky,  if you know what I mean ...
RILEY: It's okay. Joyce was released earlier today.  That intern Ben told me. They're safe at home.
WILLOW: Oh, good. And the thing, the Queller,  is it still there?
RILEY: We-- I think I've got it cornered in the  air ducts. Look, Willow... Keep at what  you're doing. Call me if you find out  how I can kill this thing.
WILLOW: Well, okay, but shouldn't we come help-- (a dial tone) O - kay.
JOYCE: I wish... I wish someone had bothered to  tell me ... because I didn't know there'd be  tennis being played, I just didn't know...  oh, why? Those eyes, they're like gasoline  puddles ... tell me because I need to know ...  why, why are you staring at me? I wish  I knew...
JOYCE: No...don't do that! Stop! Stop staring! I  don't like that. I have to rest now. I don't  like the way you're looking at me...
GRAHAM: The trail stops here, edge of the parking lot.
ELLIS: It stops?
RILEY: A car. It hitched a ride. Probably underneath.  So much for containment.
ELLIS: So some poor mental patient checks out of  here today and drives away with this thing...  took it right to his own home.
RILEY: Checked out today...
ELLIS: (barking orders) Get me a list of all patients discharged  in the last--
RILEY: (cutting him off) No. I know where it's going.
RILEY: We've got to move. <u>Now</u>.
JOYCE: It's on me! Help me! There's a bug!
DAWN: Buffy! Buffy!
DAWN: (with all her strength) BUFFY! !
BUFFY: Dawn?
BUFFY: What is it?
JOYCE: Make it stop looking at me Buffy...  it chokes me ...
JOYCE: It's okay, my baby. It's okay.
BUFFY: Spike.
SPIKE: Yeah. Listen, did you hear a noise?
BUFFY: (cold) What the hell are you doing in my house?
SPIKE: Right then, you caught me. Your  basement's full of junk and, me being in need of... junk ...
BUFFY: You were stealing?
SPIKE: Well, yeah. Can't exactly work the counter  at Burger Barn, now can I?
BUFFY: Wait. Are those pictures of-
SPIKE: (re: knife) Buffy!
RILEY: (to Buffy) Are you okay?
SPIKE: You just missed a real nice time.
BUFFY: It's gone. I killed it.
JOYCE: Oh, God...
DAWN: It's gone? You promise?
BUFFY: I promise. Everything's alright. Everything's alright ...
DREG: A body might ask what <u>exactly</u> it is you think you're doing.
DREG: He might ask what all this was meant to accomplish. Because to a humble  postulant it looks like chaos. Like  unnecessary attention drawn where it ought not be-
BEN: Get out.
DREG: Sir.
DREG: Forgive me. I just want to understand.  Why summon the Queller?
BEN: Why do you think? Because I'm cleaning  up Glory's mess. Just like I've done my  whole damn life.
JOYCE: Buffy?
BUFFY: Um hum?
JOYCE: I…
JOYCE: I want to ask you something... And if I'm  being crazy - you just tell me. Okay?
BUFFY: You got it.
JOYCE: The other day... Actually, I'm not sure  when. The days all seem to bleed  together ...
BUFFY: It's not important.
JOYCE: No, I guess it isn't. I do know I was  pretty out of it. And I had - not a  dream exactly. More like, I had this  knowledge. It just came to me - like  truth, you know? Even though it didn't  seem possible. Even though I shouldn't  think such things.
BUFFY: What, Mom? It's okay.
JOYCE: That Dawn... (pained) She's not mine, is she?
BUFFY: No.
JOYCE: She's - she does belong to us though.
BUFFY: Yes. She does.
JOYCE: And she's important. To the world.  Precious ...
JOYCE: As precious as you are to me?
JOYCE: Then we have to take care of her.  Promise me, Buffy - if anything  happens to me, if I don't come through this-
BUFFY: (cutting her off) Mom-
JOYCE: No. Let me finish. No matter what  she is, she still feels like my daughter,  and I have to know you'll keep her safe.  You'll love her like I love you.
BUFFY: I promise.
JOYCE: Good. Good...
JOYCE: My sweet, brave Buffy. What would I do without you?
