It's different.
Okay.
Willow and Tara. This is their room.
What else is different?
Okay... what... Um...
What ... What will you say to him?
What's that?
I ... Yes. I had to do that.
How long was I gone?
(thinks, then:) Longer.
I'm okay.
It ... it seemed like forever.
It was ... I can't -- I couldn't leave.
I think... I want to sleep.
Tired.
My room is still ...
<u>What did you do? Do you know  what you did? You're like children!  Your hands smell of death! Bitches!  Filthy little bitches, rattling the bones,  Did you cut a throat? Did you pat its head?</u>
<u>I know what you did!</u>
I'm fine. I'm really...
I fixed my fingers. Used little Band-Aids.
Uh-huh. So what are we killing?
Oh.
Wait. Last night. Something happened--
Um... the photographs. Of us. They changed.
They were dead. I mean, we were  dead. Like dead bodies. Then  they were okay. I thought maybe it  was me. That I was going crazy.
We should work and figure this thing out.
I miss Giles.
I think I should patrol.
Yes.
No. I need to go. Um, I know you're  worried. But I ... I feel like I have to  get out. Sorry.
Your hand is hurt.
Right.
Go! Take Dawn out of here!
Dawn!
Lunch.
You better go. You've been out  since I ... got back. Go catch up.
(smiles) I'm going to start charging people money to ask me that.
Lil' bit.
That's okay. I've got it. Look, guys ...  There's this thing. And I'm just gonna  say it.
You brought me back. I was in a place ...  I was in Hell. I don't ... I can't think  much about what it was like. But it felt ...  I felt like the world abandoned me there.  And then suddenly you guys ... You did  what you did.
So you did that. And the world came rushing  back. So... thank you. You guys gave me the  world. Thank you. I can't tell you what it  means to me.
I should have said it before.
Spike. It's daylight and you're ...
I wanted a little time alone.
That's okay. I can be alone with you here.
Right.
I'm here. I'm good.
You can't.
I was happy.
Wherever I ... was ... I was happy.  At peace. I knew that everyone  I cared about was all right. I <u>knew</u> it.  Time didn't mean anything, nothing  had form... but I was still <u>me</u>, you know? And I was warm and I was loved... and I was finished. Complete. I don't understand about dimensions or theology or any of ... but I think I was in heaven.
I was torn out of there. My friends pulled me out. And everything here is bright and hard and violent... Everything I feel, everything I touch... this is Hell. Just getting through the next moment, and the one after that... knowing what I've lost ...
