WILLOW: She's at home. She has to be.  We just have to get there.  And she'll be there.
TARA: This is the fastest way?
XANDER: Absolutely.
TARA: You're sure?
XANDER: Hey, I've done a lot of fleeing  through these mean streets.  I know all the short-cuts.
ANYA: I don't like this.
WILLOW: I wish we were there already.
XANDER: Hey, hey, don't worry, ladies,  I'll get us there just fine. My  senses are primed for danger,  and nothing's gonna HOLY CRAP!
ANYA: Oh! Xander!
XANDER: (shaky) I'm okay. (counts silently) Four. Four limbs. Doing good.
ANYA: At least the demons almost  hit you on the way out of town.
XANDER: Yeah, now that their leader's  gone they seem to be making  with the big skedaddle.
WILLOW: It was Buffy, right? We saw her  and she was really Buffy.
TARA: Yeah.
WILLOW: And she was okay. She was Buffy.
ANYA: Sure, from what I saw before  she ran off in a completely  not-like-her way. Other than that  she was exactly Buffy.
WILLOW: Right. She was fine.
ANYA: I was being sarcastic. I think we  screwed it up and she's broken.
WILLOW: No! She's not broken! She's  just disoriented from being  tormented in some kind of hell  dimension. Probably tortured and...  It's like, we don't even know how much time passed there for her,  possibly years. That's not something  you get over… (suddenly) Oh my God.
XANDER: What? Where?
WILLOW: What if she never gets over it?
ANYA: And you think of this <u>now</u>?
TARA: What are you thinking, Willow?  That she's ... that she's not right?  Or maybe, like, dangerous?
DAWN: Home! See?
DAWN: Home again, home again... (weakly) Jiggety jog.
BUFFY: It's different.
DAWN: A little. Willow and Tara  live here now, and we ... we  didn't do much...
SPIKE: Dawn!
DAWN: There you are. Knew you were  under that dirt somewhere.  Remember what Mom used to  say? "Either wash that neck or  plant potatoes."
BUFFY: Okay.
DAWN: I'll do the shirt. Then we can do your hands ...
DAWN: Mom's room. I know it's really different now.
BUFFY: Willow and Tara. This is their room.
DAWN: Yeah, well. It seemed like it made  sense. No one was using it, and it's  the biggest. But, you know, now that you're back, we'll have to figure out  what to do ...
BUFFY: What else is different?
DAWN: You mean, with the house, or...
BUFFY: Okay... what... Um...
DAWN: What what?
BUFFY: What ... What will you say to him?
DAWN: I dunno... It'll be interesting.  We could do it now, put you  on the phone, "Hi, Giles, guess  who this is?" Give him a heart attack.
BUFFY: What's that?
DAWN: It's okay.
DAWN: See? It's just Spike. (calls) I'm here!
SPIKE: (to Dawn) Thank God. You scared me half  to death... or more to death. I  could kill you!
DAWN: Spike.
SPIKE: I mean it. Could rip your head  off one handed and drink from  your brain stem.
DAWN: Look.
SPIKE: Yeah? I've seen the bloody bot before. Didn't think she'd patch up--
DAWN: She's kind of-- She's been through a lot,  with the ... death. But I think she's okay.
SPIKE: I'm... what did you do?
DAWN: Me? Nothing!
SPIKE: Her hands.
DAWN: I was gonna fix 'em. I don't know how they got like that.
SPIKE: I do. Clawed her way out of a coffin, that's how. (to Buffy) Isn't that right?
BUFFY: I ... Yes. I had to do that.
SPIKE: Done it myself.
DAWN: 'kay.
BUFFY: How long was I gone?
SPIKE: Hundred forty-seven days yesterday... um,  one-forty-eight today. 'Cept today doesn't  count, does it?
SPIKE: How long was it for you... where you were?
BUFFY: (thinks, then:) Longer.
DAWN: Got the stuff.
WILLOW: Is she here?
ANYA: She's here!
WILLOW: Buffy!
TARA: Are you okay?
DAWN: (to the others) You knew she was back? How did you know?
XANDER: What do you remember?
WILLOW: Are you in pain?
TARA: What do you know about what  happened?
DAWN: Hey!
DAWN: Back off! Let her breathe!
DAWN: You did this. What did you do?
WILLOW: A spell. We did a spell.
DAWN: Is she going to be okay?
BUFFY: I'm okay.
XANDER: How long were you gone? I mean, how long for you?
BUFFY: It ... it seemed like forever.
TARA: Oh, Buffy, I'm so sorry.
DAWN: What are you saying? Are you saying she was somewhere? Like, in hell?
ANYA: A hell-dimension. Same torture, less religion. (to Buffy) What was it like?
DAWN: No! She shouldn't have to talk about it!
BUFFY: It was ... I can't -- I couldn't leave.
DER: It's okay. You really don't have to do this, Buff.
ANYA: Mmm. Saucy. Buffy likes pizza.
WILLOW: She doesn't want pizza.
DAWN: Guys. Back off.
WILLOW: Dawn's right. Let's just be quiet. Let Buffy tell us what she needs.
BUFFY: I think... I want to sleep.
TARA: That's a good idea. You should sleep.
WILLOW: Yeah. Long day. But, Buffy... be  happy. We got you out. We really  did it.
BUFFY: Tired.
ANYA: Well, yeah. The jet-lag from hell has  gotta be, you know, the jet-lag from hell.
BUFFY: My room is still ...
DAWN: Yeah. Yes. It's your room.
WILLOW: She's fine! Normal! She used to go to bed all the time!
ANYA: (to Xander) I think Willow's wrong. I don't think she's especially normal at all.
XANDER: She just got back. Give her time.  I bet, in a week, she'll be our little Bufferin again.
ANYA: Oh yes, because six or seven days,  that's really all you need to get over  eternal hell experiences.
XANDER: Who's that? Spike?
XANDER: Ow!
ANYA: Hey!
SPIKE: You didn't tell me. You brought her back and you didn't tell me.
XANDER: Well, now you know.
SPIKE: I worked beside you. All summer. Hundred and forty-seven bleedin, days. I saved your sorry lives, all of you.
ANYA: Um... thank you and please stop pressing against my boyfriend?
XANDER: We didn't tell you. It was ... we just didn't, okay? Maybe you should  stop being a problem for a second  and just be glad that she's back..
SPIKE: Listen. I've figured it out. Maybe you haven't, but I have. Willow  knew there was a chance she'd come  back wrong. So wrong that you'd  have to-- that she'd have to get rid of  what came back. And she knew I  wouldn't let her. If any part of it was  Buffy, I wouldn't let her. That's why  she shut me out.
XANDER: What are you talking about? Willow couldn't do that!
SPIKE: That right?
XANDER: Look, you're just covering. You can't  tell me you're not happy. Look me in  the eyes. Tell me that seeing Buffy  alive wasn't the happiest damn second  of your whole existence.
SPIKE: The thing about magic? There's always consequences. Always.
WILLOW: Hey.
TARA: Did you get through to London?
WILLOW: Yeah. He's going to head back as  soon as he can. Probably... I'm not  sure, maybe a couple days.
TARA: How'd he take it?
WILLOW: Um. I'm not sure. Glad, but ... kinda  weirded out, you know? Which I get.  Lots of "dear lords… I think I actually  heard him cleaning his glasses.
TARA: Are you worried?
WILLOW: Worried? Tara, it worked fine. It's all good.
TARA: Hey, Will. This is me. It doesn't all  have to be "good" and "fine." This is  the room where you don't have to  be brave and I still love you. If you're  worried you can be worried.
WILLOW: I'm not ... unworried. What happened,  that's gotta be intense. That has to  change you. When Angel came back?  Buffy said he was wild. Like an animal.
TARA: Buffy isn't like that.
WILLOW: Yeah.
TARA: But?
WILLOW: But ...everything. I guess ...
TARA: Yeah? Let me hear?
WILLOW: Well, there's a little voice that's so  proud of what I did. And there's  one that says it was a huge mistake,  that she'll never be right again. And  then the first one -- it's a chatty one -  it says that people get over all kinds  of things, and Buffy's way stronger  than people. And then the second  voice is all like, "Oh yeah? Sez who?"  and then the first voice gets all  defensive--
TARA: Wow. I have this voice that says you're not gonna get much sleep  tonight.
WILLOW: Yeah. I think it makes it quieter in here.
TARA: You know what I think? I think we  were all assume-crash-positions.
WILLOW: What-huh-now?
TARA: It's, it's, it's like ... we were all  tensed up, like we were expecting  it to screw up. We weren't prepared  for it to actually go right.
WILLOW: Yeah.
TARA: (sleepy) Yeah?
WILLOW: If it did go right? Wouldn't she be ... happier? Like, wouldn't she be so happy we brought her out?
TARA: I'm sure she is.
WILLOW: (not buying it) Yeah...
TARA: You thought she'd say thanks? Be more grateful?
WILLOW: Am I a terrible person if I say yes?
TARA: Give her time. She'll get there.
WILLOW: Right. No need to be in a big furry hurry.
TARA: Exactly.
WILLOW: A little. She's right next door.  If something wasn't okay... I  need to know if something isn't okay.
TARA: I'm sure it's okay.
WILLOW: Buffy?
BUFFY: <u>What did you do? Do you know  what you did? You're like children!  Your hands smell of death! Bitches!  Filthy little bitches, rattling the bones,  Did you cut a throat? Did you pat its head?</u>
TARA: Oh God, oh God, oh God.
BUFFY: <u>I know what you did!</u>
TARA: No glass. There's no glass.
WILLOW: Okay, what in the frilly heck is going on?
TARA: Maybe we dreamed it.
WILLOW: Right. Right. (realizing) Wrong.
TARA: Oh, yeah. (beat) What was it talking about? Did you understand it?
WILLOW: I understood the words, but ... no.
TARA: There's, there's something in the house.
WILLOW: What is it? Could it hurt Buffy?
TARA: I don't know.
WILLOW: I'm gonna call.
ANYA: (softly) Xander? Are you up? I can't sleep. Play a word game with me.
XANDER: Huh? What? Do what? (into phone) Hello?
WILLOW: It's me, Willow. Tara and I were just attacked.
XANDER: Attacked? A vampire?
WILLOW: It was Buffy. Or something that looked like her.
TARA: Like she was possessed.
WILLOW: Then she just disappeared. And we  saw something... a little ... there's  something in the house.
XANDER: (intense) In the house? All right. Willow. You  need to get out of there. Get everyone out.
XANDER: It was very bad. Very very very very very very bad. Bad.
ANYA: (re: Xander) He's all traumatized.
WILLOW: Well, whatever it is, it's not a  traditional haunting, 'cause it's  not limited to one specific place  and there's not, you know, a dead  person.
TARA: Not anymore.
ANYA: I bet it's a hitchhiker.
XANDER: A hitchhiker?
ANYA: Standard way to travel between  alternate dimensions. Some  thing-ama-demon sees someone  moving between worlds, and grabs  on for the ride.
WILLOW: You mean some Hell beastie rode  back with Buffy. Like ... we're  responsible for this.
TARA: Assume crash positions.
XANDER: What?
TARA: Nothing.
ANYA: I think we shouldn't've brought Buffy  back. I knew it was going to go badly.  I should've said something.
WILLOW: Hey, you know what, yeah! You  should've! At least you could've  mentioned the "highjackers" so  we could stop 'em!
ANYA: They're hitchhikers, not highjackers,  and I thought you knew! It's basic  stuff! You're supposed to be the  all-powerful witch, which--
XANDER: Witch-witch?
ANYA: Witch, which raises the question,  why are you having us skulk around  and meet in the backyard like ...  like conspiracy squirrels? Sitting on  this arm is making my buttocks hurt.
WILLOW: Buffy's still asleep.
TARA: We want her to get all the rest she can.
XANDER: Okay, fine. But what are we going to  do? I mean, I'm feeling the need for  some vigorous doing, you know?
WILLOW: It's okay. We kill the beastie and all is good, we're rolling in puppies! (then) Right?
XANDER: Can we do that? Kill it?
TARA: Yah!
WILLOW: Buffy! You're not supposed to  be up!
TARA: How are you feeling? Are you okay?
ANYA: It's all right if you're still plagued with  nightmarish visions of Hell.
BUFFY: I'm fine. I'm really...
BUFFY: I fixed my fingers. Used little Band-Aids.
WILLOW: Oh, we should've done that. Sorry.
BUFFY: Uh-huh. So what are we killing?
ANYA: A demon you brought back from Hell with you.
BUFFY: Oh.
WILLOW: It's not like she's making it sound.  A little haunting-type stuff. Boo- scary, then everything's normal.
TARA: You shouldn't worry about it.
BUFFY: Wait. Last night. Something happened--
XANDER: Buff?
BUFFY: Um... the photographs. Of us. They changed.
TARA: How did they change?
BUFFY: They were dead. I mean, we were  dead. Like dead bodies. Then  they were okay. I thought maybe it  was me. That I was going crazy.
ANYA: Maybe you are! Because of Hell!  (Off Willow's glare, meekly) No. You're fine.
WILLOW: You are. Buffy, we're so glad.
XANDER: Yeah. This thing, this haunting thing,  we'll fix it, and then we'll still have you  back, which is ... it's so important.
WILLOW: Yes.
TARA: It's wonderful.
BUFFY: We should work and figure this thing out.
WILLOW: Right.
ANYA: Can we go somewhere with cushions? Let's go somewhere with cushions.
DAWN: What's the list?
ANYA: Possible hitchhikers.
XANDER: (explaining) Demons that might have come out of Hell at the same time Buffy did.
DAWN: (reads) Skaggmore demons, Trellbane demons, Skitterers, Large and Small Bone- Eaters ...
ANYA: That just means they prefer eating things with little bones. (beat) Like you.
WILLOW: That's just what we have so far.  Five species of demons that have  been known to move transdimensionally.  Two of them may be invisible in  this dimension and two others can  perform spells to alter perception.
ANYA: That's four. What's the other one like?
TARA: Kinda like the others, only dripping with viscous fluid.
DAWN: Eww.
XANDER: So should we concentrate on how to  kill those or should we try to find more?
WILLOW: I'm not sure. I guess ... Maybe some of us  could keep going finding more, and the others--
BUFFY: I miss Giles.
WILLOW: Oh. He's coming back. I talked to him.  I know I'm a kinda poor substitute, but  until then, we'll get it done ...
BUFFY: I think I should patrol.
WILLOW: I know we'll find something soon!
BUFFY: Yes.
XANDER: Do you want us to go with you?
ANYA: We could do that.
BUFFY: No. I need to go. Um, I know you're  worried. But I ... I feel like I have to  get out. Sorry.
DAWN: You should go.
ANYA: I found a 24-hour place for coffee.  Remember that bookstore? Well  they became one of those books-and- coffee places and now they're just  coffee. It's like evolution only without  the getting-better part.
DAWN: <u>Idiot</u>.
ANYA: (quickly) You can have my coffee.
DAWN: <u>All of you did it, Stupid children,  Did you think the blood wouldn't  reach you? I smell the death on you,  LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE!</u>
TARA: Dawn!
XANDER: Fire, fire, fire.
WILLOW: Oh my God, oh my God.
ANYA: (sadly) I liked that cushion.
WILLOW: That was it. Like Buffy. Only with fire.
XANDER: Is she okay?
ANYA: Did I look like that? I hope I didn't look like that.
WILLOW: No, I'm sure you looked really glamorous cutting up your face.
DAWN: What happened? What's going on?
WILLOW: You'll be okay.
ANYA: I bet you experience some dry-mouth. (explaining) Fire.
DAWN: Was it ... did the demon thing have me?
TARA: It's okay. It's okay.
XANDER: Yeah. It's gone.
ANYA: Yes. But where did it go? I mean, evil  things have plans. They have things to do.
SPIKE: Dammit!
SPIKE: (softly) Buffy?
BUFFY: Your hand is hurt.
SPIKE: Same to you.
BUFFY: Right.
SPIKE: Willow's getting pretty strong, isn't  she? Bringing you back. Hard to  get a good night's death 'round here.
XANDER: It's getting light out. Buffy's probably  on her way home from patrolling.
TARA: I like sunrise better when I'm getting up  early than when I'm staying up late, you  know? It's like I'm seeing it from the wrong side.
XANDER: Mmmokay. (then, softly) Hey, Tara. This is probably crazy, but I was talking to Spike ...
TARA: (smiling) Really? You two mix about as well as Satyrion seed and powdered turtledove.
XANDER: Mmmokay again. But, thing is,  Spike made me think. The spell  we did. It's having consequences,  isn't it? I mean, it sure seems like it.  And I was wondering... did you know  this might happen?
TARA: No!
XANDER: Do you think... could someone have known?
TARA: Willow's a talented witch and she'd never do anything to hurt anyone.
XANDER: I know, I know. Backing off quickly, see, hands in the air, I just mean--
WILLOW: Thaumogenesis!
ANYA: She's possessed!
WILLOW: Thaumogenesis.
DAWN: (to Anya) You're right.
WILLOW: I'm not possessed. It's just, I  think I figured it out. This isn't  a demon we let out. This is a  demon we made.
XANDER: We made a demon? Bad us.
WILLOW: Thaumogenesis is when doing a  spell actually creates a being. In  this case it was, like, a side-effect,  I guess. Like a price.
DAWN: What?
WILLOW: Think of it like, the world doesn't  like you getting something for free.  We asked for this huge gift -Buffy -  and the world said, fine. If you get  that, you have to take this too ... and  it made the demon.
ANYA: Technically, that's not a price. That's a gift with purchase.
DAWN: If you made a demon how come  we don't see it? I mean, we just  see us. Doing stuff.
WILLOW: I think it's out of phase with this  dimension. Its consciousness is here,  but its body is caught in the ether  between existing and not existing.
TARA: It doesn't have a body... so it's  borrowing ours ... It borrowed  Dawn and Anya ...
WILLOW: Or it's manifesting copies of them,  like it did when Buffy came at us ...
TARA: It's using them to do stuff. To scare us, attack us.
XANDER: So we need to uncreate it, right? Get it the rest of the way out of our world.
ANYA: He's right. Return the unwanted gift.  Metaphorically it works out exactly right.
WILLOW: Uh-huh. Except ... it's linked to the spell.  When we send it away, it's like the spell  doesn't exist. Like it never happened.
DAWN: (softly) Like it never brought Buffy back.
WILLOW: Yes.
DAWN: You can't do that. You can't think for  a second that you're going to do that.
ANYA: Dawn--
DAWN: If you think you can give her back to  me and then take her away again... No.  That's worse than if you'd never brought  her back. You can't mess with people's  lives this way! What about what would  happen to her? You'd send her back to  where she was, hell or whatever?
WILLOW: No. Dawn, we're not going to do it that way.
DAWN: How can you let her do this? How can  you even talk about letting her go? I  thought you loved her too!
TARA: We do. Honey, you're not listening. She said we'll find another way.
XANDER: We will.
DAWN: Then do it!
WILLOW: Wait. Dawn. Everyone hold on.
ANYA: What? Why are you smiling? (to Xander) That's inappropriate.
WILLOW: Because it's temporary.
XANDER: What is?
WILLOW: The demon. It's going to dissipate.  The only way it can survive on our  plane is if it was to kill the subject  of the original spell.
TARA: It would live if it killed Buffy?
WILLOW: Right, but that's not gonna--
XANDER: Thanks for the tip.
DEMON: Did they tell you you belonged here?  Did they say this was your home again?  Did they say there would be room for you?
DAWN: Xander! Drive faster!
XANDER: I can't!
DAWN: I could drive faster and I can't drive!
ANYA: She's right. You're like a snail. A  snail that is driving a car very slowly. (urgent) Come on! Give it the lead foot! We've  got to help Buffy with that demon you  sent after her!
XANDER: I did not send the demon -- I was possessed! The demon used me to eavesdrop on our conversation-
ANYA: Great. So now what? We can only talk in anti-demon secret code?
XANDER: Good-gay idea-yay, An-ya-ay
DAWN: Stop talking in wrong Pig Latin and drive! Buffy's in trouble!
XANDER: It's okay, Dawnie. Willow and Tara are doing a spell.
DAWN: It's not gonna send Buffy away, is it?
XANDER: No, of course not. It's just that she  can't fight this thing while it's all ...  misty. So they make it more solid,  and then Buffy can kick its newly- corporeal ass.
DAWN: You sure it'll work?
XANDER: You bet. Piece of cake.
ANYA: Right. Easy peasy. (under breath/to Xander) Hurry.
TARA: Child of words, hear thy makers.  Child of words, we entreat.  With our actions did we make thee,  to our voices wilt thou bend...
TARA: With our potions thou took motive,  with our motions came to pass.  We rescind no past devotions,  give thee substance, give thee mass. (repeating... ) Child of words, hear thy makers ...
DEMON: You're the one who's barely here. Set on this earth like a bubble.
DEMON: You won't even disturb the air when you go.
BUFFY: Go! Take Dawn out of here!
WILLOW: Solid.
DEMON: (triumphant) I am here!
DAWN: Buffy! Kill it!
XANDER: Ooph.
ANYA: Oh.
DAWN: Huh. That's probably the sort of thing I'm not s'posed to see, right?
BUFFY: Dawn!
DAWN: What's wrong?
BUFFY: Lunch.
DAWN: You made me lunch?
DAWN: Wow. Thanks.
BUFFY: You better go. You've been out  since I ... got back. Go catch up.
DAWN: Thank you.
BUFFY: (smiles) I'm going to start charging people money to ask me that.
DAWN: Everyone's been doing that, huh?
BUFFY: Lil' bit.
DAWN: They care about you a lot. When  you were gone ... it was bad when  you were gone. But it'll get better  now. Now that they can see you  being happy. That's all they want.
WILLOW: Buffy! Hey!
XANDER: You get Dawn off to school okay?  Cuz I was thinking if you need me  to pick her up--
BUFFY: That's okay. I've got it. Look, guys ...  There's this thing. And I'm just gonna  say it.
BUFFY: You brought me back. I was in a place ...  I was in Hell. I don't ... I can't think  much about what it was like. But it felt ...  I felt like the world abandoned me there.  And then suddenly you guys ... You did  what you did.
TARA: It was Willow. She knew what to do.
BUFFY: So you did that. And the world came rushing  back. So... thank you. You guys gave me the  world. Thank you. I can't tell you what it  means to me.
BUFFY: I should have said it before.
WILLOW: (through tears) You're welcome.
XANDER: Welcome home, Buffy.
SPIKE: Buffy.
BUFFY: Spike. It's daylight and you're ...
SPIKE: Not on fire? Sun's low. IS shady enough here.
SPIKE: I was gonna go in, but I overheard  you and the Super-friends sharing  "a special moment" and I came over  a bit queasy.
BUFFY: I wanted a little time alone.
SPIKE: Oh. Right then...
BUFFY: That's okay. I can be alone with you here.
SPIKE: Thanks ever so.
BUFFY: Right.
SPIKE: Buff? Slayer? You okay?
BUFFY: I'm here. I'm good.
SPIKE: Buffy, if you're in-- if you're in pain. Or if you need anything... If I can help you...
BUFFY: You can't.
SPIKE: Well, I haven't been to a Helldimension  just of late, but I know a thing or two  about torment
BUFFY: I was happy.
SPIKE: I don't ...
BUFFY: Wherever I ... was ... I was happy.  At peace. I knew that everyone  I cared about was all right. I <u>knew</u> it.  Time didn't mean anything, nothing  had form... but I was still <u>me</u>, you know? And I was warm and I was loved... and I was finished. Complete. I don't understand about dimensions or theology or any of ... but I think I was in heaven.
SPIKE: Buffy--
BUFFY: I was torn out of there. My friends pulled me out. And everything here is bright and hard and violent... Everything I feel, everything I touch... this is Hell. Just getting through the next moment, and the one after that... knowing what I've lost ...
