Dawn!
(to Dawn) Thank God. You scared me half  to death... or more to death. I  could kill you!
I mean it. Could rip your head  off one handed and drink from  your brain stem.
Yeah? I've seen the bloody bot before. Didn't think she'd patch up--
I'm... what did you do?
Her hands.
I do. Clawed her way out of a coffin, that's how. (to Buffy) Isn't that right?
Done it myself.
Hundred forty-seven days yesterday... um,  one-forty-eight today. 'Cept today doesn't  count, does it?
How long was it for you... where you were?
You didn't tell me. You brought her back and you didn't tell me.
I worked beside you. All summer. Hundred and forty-seven bleedin, days. I saved your sorry lives, all of you.
Listen. I've figured it out. Maybe you haven't, but I have. Willow  knew there was a chance she'd come  back wrong. So wrong that you'd  have to-- that she'd have to get rid of  what came back. And she knew I  wouldn't let her. If any part of it was  Buffy, I wouldn't let her. That's why  she shut me out.
That right?
The thing about magic? There's always consequences. Always.
Dammit!
(softly) Buffy?
Same to you.
Willow's getting pretty strong, isn't  she? Bringing you back. Hard to  get a good night's death 'round here.
Buffy.
Not on fire? Sun's low. IS shady enough here.
I was gonna go in, but I overheard  you and the Super-friends sharing  "a special moment" and I came over  a bit queasy.
Oh. Right then...
Thanks ever so.
Buff? Slayer? You okay?
Buffy, if you're in-- if you're in pain. Or if you need anything... If I can help you...
Well, I haven't been to a Helldimension  just of late, but I know a thing or two  about torment
I don't ...
Buffy--
