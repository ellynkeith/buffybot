She's at home. She has to be.  We just have to get there.  And she'll be there.
I wish we were there already.
It was Buffy, right? We saw her  and she was really Buffy.
And she was okay. She was Buffy.
Right. She was fine.
No! She's not broken! She's  just disoriented from being  tormented in some kind of hell  dimension. Probably tortured and...  It's like, we don't even know how much time passed there for her,  possibly years. That's not something  you get over… (suddenly) Oh my God.
What if she never gets over it?
Is she here?
Buffy!
Are you in pain?
A spell. We did a spell.
She doesn't want pizza.
Dawn's right. Let's just be quiet. Let Buffy tell us what she needs.
Yeah. Long day. But, Buffy... be  happy. We got you out. We really  did it.
She's fine! Normal! She used to go to bed all the time!
Hey.
Yeah. He's going to head back as  soon as he can. Probably... I'm not  sure, maybe a couple days.
Um. I'm not sure. Glad, but ... kinda  weirded out, you know? Which I get.  Lots of "dear lords… I think I actually  heard him cleaning his glasses.
Worried? Tara, it worked fine. It's all good.
I'm not ... unworried. What happened,  that's gotta be intense. That has to  change you. When Angel came back?  Buffy said he was wild. Like an animal.
Yeah.
But ...everything. I guess ...
Well, there's a little voice that's so  proud of what I did. And there's  one that says it was a huge mistake,  that she'll never be right again. And  then the first one -- it's a chatty one -  it says that people get over all kinds  of things, and Buffy's way stronger  than people. And then the second  voice is all like, "Oh yeah? Sez who?"  and then the first voice gets all  defensive--
Yeah. I think it makes it quieter in here.
What-huh-now?
Yeah.
If it did go right? Wouldn't she be ... happier? Like, wouldn't she be so happy we brought her out?
(not buying it) Yeah...
Am I a terrible person if I say yes?
Right. No need to be in a big furry hurry.
A little. She's right next door.  If something wasn't okay... I  need to know if something isn't okay.
Buffy?
Okay, what in the frilly heck is going on?
Right. Right. (realizing) Wrong.
I understood the words, but ... no.
What is it? Could it hurt Buffy?
I'm gonna call.
It's me, Willow. Tara and I were just attacked.
It was Buffy. Or something that looked like her.
Then she just disappeared. And we  saw something... a little ... there's  something in the house.
Well, whatever it is, it's not a  traditional haunting, 'cause it's  not limited to one specific place  and there's not, you know, a dead  person.
You mean some Hell beastie rode  back with Buffy. Like ... we're  responsible for this.
Hey, you know what, yeah! You  should've! At least you could've  mentioned the "highjackers" so  we could stop 'em!
Buffy's still asleep.
It's okay. We kill the beastie and all is good, we're rolling in puppies! (then) Right?
Buffy! You're not supposed to  be up!
Oh, we should've done that. Sorry.
It's not like she's making it sound.  A little haunting-type stuff. Boo- scary, then everything's normal.
You are. Buffy, we're so glad.
Yes.
Right.
That's just what we have so far.  Five species of demons that have  been known to move transdimensionally.  Two of them may be invisible in  this dimension and two others can  perform spells to alter perception.
I'm not sure. I guess ... Maybe some of us  could keep going finding more, and the others--
Oh. He's coming back. I talked to him.  I know I'm a kinda poor substitute, but  until then, we'll get it done ...
I know we'll find something soon!
Oh my God, oh my God.
That was it. Like Buffy. Only with fire.
No, I'm sure you looked really glamorous cutting up your face.
You'll be okay.
Thaumogenesis!
Thaumogenesis.
I'm not possessed. It's just, I  think I figured it out. This isn't  a demon we let out. This is a  demon we made.
Thaumogenesis is when doing a  spell actually creates a being. In  this case it was, like, a side-effect,  I guess. Like a price.
Think of it like, the world doesn't  like you getting something for free.  We asked for this huge gift -Buffy -  and the world said, fine. If you get  that, you have to take this too ... and  it made the demon.
I think it's out of phase with this  dimension. Its consciousness is here,  but its body is caught in the ether  between existing and not existing.
Or it's manifesting copies of them,  like it did when Buffy came at us ...
Uh-huh. Except ... it's linked to the spell.  When we send it away, it's like the spell  doesn't exist. Like it never happened.
Yes.
No. Dawn, we're not going to do it that way.
Wait. Dawn. Everyone hold on.
Because it's temporary.
The demon. It's going to dissipate.  The only way it can survive on our  plane is if it was to kill the subject  of the original spell.
Right, but that's not gonna--
Solid.
Buffy! Hey!
(through tears) You're welcome.
