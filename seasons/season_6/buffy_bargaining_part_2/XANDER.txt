I'm pretty sure she's okay. (then) Or as okay as anyone who just  had snakes coming out of their mouth  and what the hell was up with that, Tara?!
The woods should give us some cover.  Their motorcycles can't follow us in here.
New plan: We split up.
No. I can carry her. (off her look, reassuring) I'll keep her safe, Tara.
The Magic Box. And whoever gets there first should call Dawn and Spike.
(regretfully) We can't. She's-- (then) It's lost.
Shhh. We're using our quiet voice, Wil.
Off and running. Like we need to be. We gotta keep moving.
Yep. We got trouble. Right here in Hellmouth City. And our very own Robo-Buffy led them right to us.
Wil, I told you--
We can't--
The Urn of Cirrhosis ...
Yeah. It got ... kinda...
So, we'll find another one. Better  made. Ahn and I'll jump back into  the web and--
'Kay. Then we'll fix this one. A little tape, dab o' Krazy Glue ...
Okay, this is really starting to grate  my cheese. These woods aren't that  big. And I know we-ve been going  in a straight line, 'cause I've been  following the North Star.
(looking closer) No, it's not an airplane.  It's definitely-- (his face falling) --a blimp. But I can see how one  could make that airplane mistake.
Can't be much further.
As for example, snakes. Why didn't you tell us how much--
What were we into back there, Wil?
Don't get avoidy on me.
(dripping sarcasm)  Demons! Huh. Well, there's something  you don't see everyday. (then) Unless you're us!
There! See? Avoidy!
(seeing it, unnerved) You mean the one moving toward us ...
"<i>Hello</i>?" We're being hunted and  you're "helloing" strange fast moving  lights in the dark? It could be anything. It-- (with dread) It's a motorcycle headlight.
Get behind me!
Wil, stay down! I'll take care of--
Bug!! (swatting it away) Ahh! Big firefly bug thing!
Get off! Get-- Do fireflies bite? Or... They probably burn, don't they? They-- Yee-uuuhh!
Uh, Willow. W-what--?
(more to himself) And how long have you known your girlfriend was Tinkerbell?
Well, then, what was I so worried about?
Maybe they're on their way here.  I mean, this place is NORAD when  we're at DefCon One.
Well, there's a guy at work I kinda hit it off with. Tito. I mean, he seems like a good-- (off her look) And you meant Dawn and Spike, of course.
Ahn, honey, we're nearing your point, right?
(finishing her thought) Buffy.
Well, they can't keep it up forever. I mean, maybe they'll party themselves out, tire of this place and move on.
Anya...
Can we talk about this later?
Watch it!
Oh, peachy. No doubt here to lead the Wild Bunch right to us again.
Aw no...
No!! How could we... Ugh! So <u>stupid</u>.
The spell. Our little resurrection spell worked like a magic charm. We brought you back to life, Buffy. (to the others) Right where we left her... (his expression hardens) In her coffin.
Buffy? Buffy, it's Xander. We're ... sorry. We didn't know... (no response) Buffy?
(pulling her back) Anya!
Don't see you winning any beauty contests, unless the Miss My-Face-Fell-off Pageant gets going...
The better to cut you down to size, grandma.
I happen to be a very powerful Manwitch myself. Or... male... is it 'warlock'?
(comforted) She's Buffy. She's herself again.
(rationalizing) She just ... needs some time, is all. The important thing is she's back... She'll be fine ...
Wrap the chain around his legs. Maybe we can restrain--
Tara. Nice axing.
