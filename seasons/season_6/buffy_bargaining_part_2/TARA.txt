Willow?
I'll take Willow--
(nods) We should meet up somewhere.
Doesn't sound like they found  Willow and Xander...
I think the woods let out over this  way. We should keep off the streets,  take alleys if we can...
Let's go.
(calling out, hopefully) Willow? Xander?
Yet.
(calm certainty) They're all right.
I don't--
Anya--
They're not.
He's with Willow. If something ... happened... I'd know. (beat) And so would you.
I'm sure of it ...
No. It's okay. Lost is good...
(eyes still closed) Shh. (incanting) "Aradia... Hear my words ..."
Are you--?
We've been calling the house, but...
If we're going, we should go now.  They seem to be getting more and  more worked up by the minute.
It wasn't your fault.
Well maybe ...
(a little afraid to say) Maybe it wasn't supposed to. I mean, those d-demons coming just at the exact wrong time ... M-maybe we really were in over our heads. Invoking forces that we have no right to... Maybe the fates sent all this destruction down on us to stop us. I mean --
(unsure) It's ... the Buffybot.
(indicating an offshoot) Here.
Her hands are bleeding. Her fingernails ...
You're not reaching her. She's too traumatized.
Incendire
More than one.
Well, they wanted a massacre.
Should we follow?
Nobody messes with my girl.
My first.
