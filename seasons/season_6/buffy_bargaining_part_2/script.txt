BUFFYBOT: I'm dangerously close-- (struck) Uhh! --to system failure. I have to to disengage from-- (struck again) Uhh! --combat until Willow can service me.
RAZOR: I'll service you, toygirl.
TARA: Willow?
XANDER: I'm pretty sure she's okay. (then) Or as okay as anyone who just  had snakes coming out of their mouth  and what the hell was up with that, Tara?!
ANYA: Less talk, more running away.
XANDER: The woods should give us some cover.  Their motorcycles can't follow us in here.
ANYA: Somebody should tell them that.
XANDER: New plan: We split up.
ANYA: No! Bad plan!
TARA: I'll take Willow--
XANDER: No. I can carry her. (off her look, reassuring) I'll keep her safe, Tara.
TARA: (nods) We should meet up somewhere.
XANDER: The Magic Box. And whoever gets there first should call Dawn and Spike.
ANYA: But ... (a thought) The Buffybot ...
XANDER: (regretfully) We can't. She's-- (then) It's lost.
WILLOW: X-Xander... Where--?
XANDER: Shhh. We're using our quiet voice, Wil.
WILLOW: Why... Why are-- Where's Tara?
XANDER: Off and running. Like we need to be. We gotta keep moving.
WILLOW: Moving. (starting to remember) Oh. Right. Demons. On bikes.
XANDER: Yep. We got trouble. Right here in Hellmouth City. And our very own Robo-Buffy led them right to us.
WILLOW: (remembering) Buffy! The ritual! We have to go back!
XANDER: Wil, I told you--
WILLOW: We need to try again.
XANDER: We can't--
WILLOW: We have to, Xander! She's ... She's waiting, counting on us. On me. (her grief mounting) I can't leave her there anymore. I won't. We have to finish--
XANDER: The Urn of Cirrhosis ...
WILLOW: Osiris.
XANDER: Yeah. It got ... kinda...
WILLOW: Broken. It's broken. I remember.
XANDER: So, we'll find another one. Better  made. Ahn and I'll jump back into  the web and--
WILLOW: (numbly) There is no other one.
XANDER: 'Kay. Then we'll fix this one. A little tape, dab o' Krazy Glue ...
WILLOW: (despairing) No. It's no good. The urn's defiled. It's gone. Nothing.
ANYA: Was that necessary? A simple "psst" would've been--
KLYED: ...just sayin, it's rank!
MAG: (in no mood) Get off it, Klyed.
KLYED: Razor and the others take off for town,  leave us here to hunt strays. It's bush--
MAG: Hey! You got a bug up your crack,  take it up with Razor. Until then,  you do what he says and shut your  hole. Before I rip you a new one.
TARA: Doesn't sound like they found  Willow and Xander...
ANYA: (distracted) Did he say "stores?" "Hitting stores?" Does he mean looting?
TARA: I think the woods let out over this  way. We should keep off the streets,  take alleys if we can...
ANYA: They can't loot the magic shop. Not now. I just got it.
TARA: Let's go.
ANYA: You don't think they'll cause a lot of damage, do you?
SPIKE: Nothing. Coupla stakes. Right big help. Holy water, one cross-- (sizzling noise) Yahh!! (shaking his head at himself) Oh, brilliant.
DAWN: Who are they?
SPIKE: Hellions ...
SPIKE: Any place they think is vulnerable.
DAWN: They know...
SPIKE: We can't stay here.
DAWN: Well, I'm not going out there.
SPIKE: Got no choice, Bit. Can't protect you here.
DAWN: We can lock the doors, turn out the lights ...
SPIKE: And hide under the bed linens? Not really my style.
DAWN: But ... We need to wait for the others. Buffy...
SPIKE: (sharply) Look--
DAWN: (after a beat) Right.
SPIKE: (with a nod) Right, then. Can't wait around  to see if the others pop in. We're on our own...
TARA: (calling out, hopefully) Willow? Xander?
ANYA: Thank God...
TARA: Yet.
ANYA: Xander...
TARA: (calm certainty) They're all right.
ANYA: Then where are they? Why aren't they here yet?
TARA: I don't--
ANYA: What if they're hurt? Xander could  be lying somewhere. All broken  and bleeding. Calling my name--
TARA: Anya--
ANYA: Like that! Or -- oh --
TARA: They're not.
ANYA: How do you--
TARA: He's with Willow. If something ... happened... I'd know. (beat) And so would you.
ANYA: (wanting to believe) You think?
TARA: I'm sure of it ...
ANYA: (a new concern) The woods? We're going back to the woods? I hate the woods. All those woodsy trees--
TARA: No. It's okay. Lost is good...
ANYA: With yoga?
TARA: (eyes still closed) Shh. (incanting) "Aradia... Hear my words ..."
XANDER: Okay, this is really starting to grate  my cheese. These woods aren't that  big. And I know we-ve been going  in a straight line, 'cause I've been  following the North Star.
WILLOW: Um, Xander, that's not the North Star. It's an airplane.
XANDER: (looking closer) No, it's not an airplane.  It's definitely-- (his face falling) --a blimp. But I can see how one  could make that airplane mistake.
WILLOW: Xander... I can't walk anymore. I have to rest.
XANDER: Can't be much further.
WILLOW: You said that an hour ago. I'm just ... (closes her eyes) The spell took a lot out of me.
XANDER: As for example, snakes. Why didn't you tell us how much--
WILLOW: Don't. Not now.
XANDER: What were we into back there, Wil?
WILLOW: Doesn't make any difference now...
XANDER: Don't get avoidy on me.
WILLOW: I'm not avoidy. We've got bigger  problems. Demons.
XANDER: (dripping sarcasm)  Demons! Huh. Well, there's something  you don't see everyday. (then) Unless you're us!
WILLOW: And we're lost. So can we just-
XANDER: There! See? Avoidy!
WILLOW: That light.
XANDER: (seeing it, unnerved) You mean the one moving toward us ...
WILLOW: (calling out) Hello?
XANDER: "<i>Hello</i>?" We're being hunted and  you're "helloing" strange fast moving  lights in the dark? It could be anything. It-- (with dread) It's a motorcycle headlight.
WILLOW: No. Too small--
XANDER: Get behind me!
WILLOW: (squinting) Xander, I don't think--
XANDER: Wil, stay down! I'll take care of--
WILLOW: Oh. It's just--
XANDER: Bug!! (swatting it away) Ahh! Big firefly bug thing!
WILLOW: Xander...
XANDER: Get off! Get-- Do fireflies bite? Or... They probably burn, don't they? They-- Yee-uuuhh!
WILLOW: It's not a bug.
XANDER: Uh, Willow. W-what--?
WILLOW: It's Tara.
XANDER: (more to himself) And how long have you known your girlfriend was Tinkerbell?
FORM: What are you doing? Get away  from there!
HOMEOWNER: I said, get off my property!
SPIKE: (to Dawn) Keep back.
DAWN: It looks like they're just ... wrecking  stuff. No thought other than just...  destructorama.
SPIKE: Eh? Oh. Nothing. Just, um... (wistfully) Looks like fun.
SPIKE: (to Dawn) Let's fly, pidge!
ANYA: Already been looted! Sorry! Try  the appliance store at the end of the  block! They've got pretty... um, toasters--
ANYA: Xander!
XANDER: Well, then, what was I so worried about?
TARA: Are you--?
WILLOW: Not yet. (a weak smile) But I will be.
TARA: We've been calling the house, but...
XANDER: Maybe they're on their way here.  I mean, this place is NORAD when  we're at DefCon One.
WILLOW: We have to go out and look for them.
XANDER: Well, there's a guy at work I kinda hit it off with. Tito. I mean, he seems like a good-- (off her look) And you meant Dawn and Spike, of course.
ANYA: Um. Question. You want us to go back out there?
WILLOW: (a little unsure) Well, yeah. Unless someone's got a better idea.
ANYA: It's just ... Well, we're minus one  Buffybot. And Spike is missing in  action somewhere with Dawn. And  Giles flew away. And you look a  little magicked out ...
XANDER: Ahn, honey, we're nearing your point, right?
ANYA: Just ... How are we supposed to fight these guys?
XANDER: (finishing her thought) Buffy.
WILLOW: Buffy... (then, with painful resignation) ... is not coming back. We failed.
TARA: If we're going, we should go now.  They seem to be getting more and  more worked up by the minute.
XANDER: Well, they can't keep it up forever. I mean, maybe they'll party themselves out, tire of this place and move on.
RAZOR: Say hello to your new home, boys!
RAZOR: So I figured what better way to  kick off our semi-settling down  than with a little christening ...
RAZOR: All in one, quick, really REALLY violent, fell swoop...
RAZOR: Bye-bye, Slayer.
BUFFY: Nooooooooo!!
RAZOR: Another one for the fire, boys ...
TARA: It wasn't your fault.
WILLOW: It would've worked.
TARA: Well maybe ...
WILLOW: What?
TARA: (a little afraid to say) Maybe it wasn't supposed to. I mean, those d-demons coming just at the exact wrong time ... M-maybe we really were in over our heads. Invoking forces that we have no right to... Maybe the fates sent all this destruction down on us to stop us. I mean --
WILLOW: You mean maybe it's my fault.
ANYA: I'm not saying we announce it this second...
XANDER: Anya...
ANYA: I think it will please them to know we're engaged. And I think Willow, in particular, could use a morale booster right now.
XANDER: Can we talk about this later?
ANYA: It's just that... Well, all the excuses for not telling anyone we're engaged are gone now. I mean, apart from hell-bikers, there's nothing hanging over us anymore. This is it. No more surprises.
XANDER: Watch it!
TARA: (unsure) It's ... the Buffybot.
XANDER: Oh, peachy. No doubt here to lead the Wild Bunch right to us again.
WILLOW: Buffy?
ANYA: Where did--?
TARA: (indicating an offshoot) Here.
WILLOW: Buffy... Buffy, are you...? (new approach) It's Willow. Can you hear me?
ANYA: What's wrong with her?
WILLOW: (almost defensively) Nothing. She's ... she's in shock.
TARA: Her hands are bleeding. Her fingernails ...
XANDER: Aw no...
WILLOW: What?
XANDER: No!! How could we... Ugh! So <u>stupid</u>.
WILLOW: Xander?!
XANDER: The spell. Our little resurrection spell worked like a magic charm. We brought you back to life, Buffy. (to the others) Right where we left her... (his expression hardens) In her coffin.
WILLOW: oh... God...
XANDER: Buffy? Buffy, it's Xander. We're ... sorry. We didn't know... (no response) Buffy?
TARA: You're not reaching her. She's too traumatized.
ANYA: (gently) Hey, Buffy, here's some good news that might perk you right up. Xander and I have an announcement--
XANDER: (pulling her back) Anya!
ANYA: What?! I'm trying to help.  XANDER Buffy. It's going to be all right. We ... We brought you back. You're home now.
RAZOR: Welcome home, Slayer. Alive and kicking after all.
XANDER: Don't see you winning any beauty contests, unless the Miss My-Face-Fell-off Pageant gets going...
RAZOR: Big axe you got there.
XANDER: The better to cut you down to size, grandma.
TARA: Incendire
RAZOR: So you got a witch in the mix.
TARA: More than one.
XANDER: I happen to be a very powerful Manwitch myself. Or... male... is it 'warlock'?
ANYA: Plus we have a Slayer here (looking at feral Buffy) who might actually be looking to eat some brains so, I think a quiet moseying, no hard feelings and I'm sure your demon horde won't think any the less of you...
RAZOR: Now, my boys, see ... that's tricky. They came looking for a massacre. And I think you got exactly enough magic between you for a kiddies birthday party.
WILLOW: (stepping forward) You'd be wrong.
RAZOR: Whoah. I better back off or you might pull a rabbit out of a hat.
ANYA: (to the girls, terrified) Don't do that! Why would you do that?
WILLOW: (to Razor) Look. We don't want trouble. And you don't want trouble.
RAZOR: Of course we want trouble. We're demons. We're really all about trouble.
WILLOW: Not this kind.
RAZOR: I get your point.
ANYA: Does this mean we win?
DAWN: There! What's that?
SPIKE: Just a machine, Dawn.
DAWN: I know.
BUFFYBOT: Dawn. You're my sister Dawn. Where did I go?
DAWN: What?
BUFFYBOT: Where did I go? I was here. Here. But then I ran away.
DAWN: I don't ...
BUFFYBOT: (computing). No. Not me. The other Buffy.
DAWN: (small) Buffy... ?
BUFFYBOT: I don't-- I don't know where she went. Maybe--
SPIKE: (genuinely mournful) Tsk. Look what those filthy buggers done to you.
TARA: Well, they wanted a massacre.
XANDER: (comforted) She's Buffy. She's herself again.
WILLOW: Buffy!
ANYA: Where's she going?
TARA: Should we follow?
WILLOW: I don't know... I ...
XANDER: (rationalizing) She just ... needs some time, is all. The important thing is she's back... She'll be fine ...
ANYA: Xander! Look out!
RAZOR: Now what kind of a Slayer is it runs out on her buddies ... just when they need her most.
KLYED: Little Girl... wanna use the street ... gotta pay a toll.
DAWN: Let go of me!
RAZOR: You're next. First you. Then those bitch friends of--
WILLOW: Obfuscate!
XANDER: Wrap the chain around his legs. Maybe we can restrain--
ANYA: (moving to him) Xander!
WILLOW: Fragilis!
RAZOR: So. Witch. Got a little power after all.
WILLOW: (choking out) T-Tara?
TARA: Nobody messes with my girl.
XANDER: Tara. Nice axing.
TARA: My first.
WILLOW: (looking off) Buffy.
DAWN: Buffy... no ...
DAWN: Buffy?
BUFFY: (a small voice) Is this hell?
DAWN: What?
BUFFY: Is this hell?
DAWN: No. Buffy, no. You're here. With me. Whatever happened to you... Whatever you've been through... It's-It's over now. You're--
BUFFY: (lost in thought) It was so clear here., On this spot. I remember how... shiny and clear everything was. But now, now it's ...
DAWN: Buffy, please..
BUFFY: (whispered) Dawn. (then) Dawn!
DAWN: (straining to reach the rail) I-- I can't--
