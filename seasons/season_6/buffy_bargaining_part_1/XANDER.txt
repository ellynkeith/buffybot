Uh oh. Sounds like the other units are engaged...
Great googely moogely Willow you've got to quit doing that!
But not the lay of my brain!
I know, I know. I don't have to talk  when I answer you. But I saw The Fury  and that way lies spooky carnival death-
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
You know, if we want to be exactly--
I know.
(important voice) House o' chicks, relax. I'm a man and I have a tool! (sees Dawn) Tools. Lots of plural tools. In my toolbox. (sees something) Many sandwiches! Excellent. Men like sandwiches.
I got that soldering wire you wanted. For Buffybot's tune-up.
She did? Great.
(coolly) I go by many names ...
If he thought that the real Buffy was gone, he could take Dawn away.
So excellent. We're agreed. Sit  your roboself down so we can get  to work. We need to fix up those  fighting skills, pronto.
I guess. Depends how highly you prize punning.
Okay. When I'm marvelling at the immaturity? Be scared. (to Anya) Anya. Giles is leaving the store to you when he goes. What more do  you want?
Who you should be very nice to  unless you want to end up working  at Video Hut.
Give it time, An. This is hard for all of us. You need to be patient.
We've talked about this We can't announce our engagement while  things are so up in the air.
It is, but ... If things go as planned -  everything could be different.  Let's just hold on.
Please. Anya. We'll know more after we talk to Willow and Tara tonight.
You got your somber on, Will. The urn not up to spec?
It's time? Like, time time? With theâ€¦ timeliness?
But why the sudden rushy-rush? Did the bot blow her cover at school?
And they still thought it was Buffy?
Whoah! Let's apply the brake and  check rear and side mirrors here!  This is deep stuff, Willow. We're  talking about raising the dead.
I don't know...
It just ... it feels wrong.
Excuse me. Who made you the boss  of the group?
Valid points all. But we -- I mean, we  were just talking then...
Scenario: We raise Buffy from the grave.  She tries to eat our brains. Do we, 'A':  congratulate ourselves on a job well done--
We saw her body, Will. We buried it.
What time do we meet?
Giles isn't around. You can dump the cryptic.
Okay. Right. What is "Vino de Madre" anyway?
We weren't, but it felt too weird hanging  out on our own.
(reading) "I've gone. Not one for good-byes, I thought it best to slip out quietly.  Love to you all, Giles."
I wanted to buy you a can of Old English  800. 'Cause, you know, of England  and you... And 'cause it sounded funny  at the time but the guy living in the box  in front of the store wouldn't buy it for us.
Good thing. My face hurts from faux smiling.
Can you believe the timing? He's leaving right when we're doing- (eyes Dawn) The thing. Tonight.
It'll be dark soon.
One minute to midnight. Less.
Willow!
She needs help!
Willow, are you okay?
I - I'm sorry.
