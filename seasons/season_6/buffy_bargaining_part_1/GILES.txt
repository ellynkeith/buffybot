I'm fine. I just need to need to... die ... for a minute...
(riffing) Good God. What if he attempts to operate heavy machinery?!
Van Elton?
(breathless) S-Spike!
You might have let me in on your plan while he throttled me.
We just can't have her messing up  in front of the wrong person -- or  the wrong thing. We need the world and the underworld -- to believe  Buffy is alive and well.
And she's gone.
(re: paper he's holding) Anya - this register report for January  looks off. Let's pull those files again.

I'm sorry if you resent my thoroughness,  but I won't be comfortable leaving here until-
It's not inventory. It's part of my personal collection.

Not you. Me.
This is ... impossible, really.
I have no doubt.
That's me.
Just, yes.
I'm a phone call away, if you need anything. You must promise me.
Willow. I don't know where to start ...
Right. Right ...
I suppose that's the question, isn't it?
