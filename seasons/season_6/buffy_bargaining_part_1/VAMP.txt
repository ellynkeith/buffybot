Slayer...
You're - you're a machine-
... so I've got her cornered in this alley, see?
Yeah. I figured, it's my duty, right?  She's a menace to our society. So we  fight - and I'm like - BOOM, BOOM,  BOOM! I got her on the ropes-
I swear on all that's unholy! You  haven't even heard the best part. I cut her, right? And she's, I don't know,  some kind of machine. She's not human.
I'm telling you - it wasn't even the  slayer, man. It was like a trick. A robot.
(nervous) Okay. See, I was over in Sunnydale,  minding my own beeswax, when I see  the Slayer-
We fought, right? And I was all over her - BOOM, BOOM-
A robot, yeah! And I kicked her synthetic ass. You shoulda seen the sparks ...
That's what I'm saying. They've got  some kind of decoy standing in for  her. The town is wide open.
Yeah. With your muscle you could  own it in no time. And, look, I know  you guys don't usually let vampires  join the gang and I've got the whole- (makes quotes) "sunlight issue"- but I was thinking,  as thanks for the 411, you might let  me throw in with you-
