BUFFY: So, we meet at last, Mister Drippy.
DAWN: Want me to call a plumber?
BUFFY: No.
DAWN: You sure?
BUFFY: Yes.
DAWN: (holds up phone) Got the number.
BUFFY: Dawn - I'm on it, okay?
DAWN: Man, how much water can they fit in one set of pipes?
TARA: If I understand it right? The entire city water supply.
WILLOW: It's like clown cars in the circus.
DAWN: Told you we should have called a plumber.
BUFFY: You were right. The plumber will make everything good.
TARA: Dawnie. You're not eating breakfast?
BUFFY: (a little spaced) But breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It's unbelievably important. Dawn, you should eat breakfast three times a day.
DAWN: I'll, um, grab something before school.
XANDER: And a big Sunnydale round of applause for Tito the amazing. Plumber extraordinaire.
TARA: So how's it looking down there?
XANDER: Like we should start gathering up two of every animal.
TITO: Basically, your pipes are shot. I mean, the whole system's gonna have to be replaced. You need the full copper re-pipe down there.
WILLOW: Full copper re-pipe? That sounds potentially pricey.
TITO: If you have any questions, our number's on the invoice.
DAWN: That's a weird phone number. Wait - is that the bill?
XANDER: Hey, Tito cut you a good deal down there. Those are his bargain prices. I did a little haggling for you.
BUFFY: Thank you. So? We'll pay him, what's the big deal.
WILLOW: Uh, Buffy, I know you're still getting back on your feet after ...
BUFFY: Lying flat on my back?
WILLOW: Yeah. But there's Some money stuff we have to talk to you about.
BUFFY: So, okay, you're telling me I'm broke?
WILLOW: Not yet, but ...
TARA: Money's definitely becoming an issue.
XANDER: As in, your being almost out of it.
BUFFY: But, I haven't spent any money. I was all dead and frugal.
WILLOW: I know, this comes as a bit of a shock after ... a bit of a shock, but it caught us by surprise, too.
TARA: Your Mom prepared everything really well. She had insurance. (awkward) Life insurance.
XANDER: Which should have left you covered, but - hospital bills.
WILLOW: They pretty much sucked up all the money.
ANYA: Which you're still hemorrhaging, by the way.
BUFFY: How'd I do that?
ANYA: Not you. The house. See, this house, just sitting here, doing nothing, in itself costs money.
DAWN: So, what do we do?
BUFFY: Easy. We burn the house to the ground, collect the insurance. Plus, fire? Pretty.
WILLOW: (indicating Dawn) Buffy ...
BUFFY: (to Dawn) I'll take care of this. I promise. I just don't know how yet.
ANYA: I know how.
BUFFY: For what?
ANYA: Slaying vampires! You provide a valuable service to the whole community. I say, cash in.
BUFFY: Well, that's an idea... you would have. Any other suggestions?
ANYA: It's not so crazy.
DAWN: Yes it is! You can't charge innocent people for saving their lives.
ANYA: Spider Man does.
DAWN: He does not!
ANYA: Does too.
DAWN: Does n ... (catching herself) Xander?
XANDER: (reluctantly) Action is his reward.
ANYA: Why are you never on my side?
XANDER: What are you talking about? Not on your side? Anya! I <i>am</i> your side!
WILLOW: You're throwing away a gold mine.
XANDER: Anya, come on! Wait up. What's wrong with you?
ANYA: Why don't you ask your best friend Spider Man? You know, if you're not going to support me --
XANDER: I'm supportive! I'm totally supportive! I'm a flying buttress of support!
ANYA: No you're not.
XANDER: This is because I haven't told-them about our engagement yet. Isn't it?
ANYA: No. Maybe. Yes! It's painful and confusing. First you buy me this beautiful ring and then I can't even wear it in public.
XANDER: Anya, I promise, your waiting days are almost over. I know it's frustrating, but the way I understand this marriage thing? It's kind of a forever deal.
ANYA: Not if you never get started. Don't you want to get married?
XANDER: Yes.
ANYA: So why won't you tell them?
XANDER: Because. I'm still getting used to the miracle of a steady paycheck. Getting out of my parents' house. This? The husband thing? It's a big step. or, maybe a lot of little ones. And I love you so much, I want to get each one just right.
ANYA: Really?
XANDER: Anya-
ANYA: When are you going to grow up, Xander?
BUFFY: This is my first big loan. (then) Collateral? No problem. (then) No problem. (then) Love the tie. (then) I'm a problem <i>solver</i>. (then) Let's.crunch those numbers! (re: herself) Stupid skirt.
SAVITSKY: Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Carl Savitsky. Loan Officer.
BUFFY: Buffy Summers. Loan Applier-for.
SAVITSKY: Okay. I don't think I'll need this ... or these... old report cards, definitely not...
BUFFY: Um, so... about my getting a loan... ?
SAVITSKY: Yes. Well, what we've got here is, financially, a bit of a tangle.
BUFFY: I know. And I figured you could just cut through that tangle with scissors. (gestures snipping) Where the loan is the scissors.
SAVITSKY: Ms. Summers, the only collateral you have is your house, which was never fully leveraged, and has been losing equity over the last several years. For some reason, Sunnydale property values have never been competitive, and re-financing's out of the question...
BUFFY: Are you saying you won't give me a loan?
SAVITSKY: Well the problem is, you have no income. No job...
BUFFY: (resigned) No job. I wish.
BUFFY: Hey!
GUARD: P-put the girl down.
BUFFY: These? Never helpful.
WILLOW: I mean, okay, even if the bank <u>was</u> robbed -- which you battling demons couldn't possibly know -- you'd think there'd be some kind of reward.
BUFFY: You're asking the wrong gal.
WILLOW: (happily) Hey. Buffy, you're mad.
BUFFY: You noticed.
WILLOW: No! I mean, anger is a big, powerful emotion you <i>should</i> feel.
BUFFY: Oh, well, that's good then. (beat) It's gone now.
WILLOW: Okay - let me make you mad again. Ready? Um, um ... (bingo) Last semester? I slept with Riley.
BUFFY: And you know I really doubt it.
WILLOW: Caught me. Big fib. (inspired) ... To cover up my sleazy affair with Angel.
BUFFY: Will, what the hell are you doing?
WILLOW: Pissing you off.
BUFFY: Yes. True. Why?
WILLOW: 'Cause, you know, since you got back, you haven't exactly been ... big with the whole range of human emotions thing.
BUFFY: What do you mean?
WILLOW: Well, you haven't really... no, I mean it's just, um ... You know this is really my problem. I'm all over the place and, forget I even said anything cause, cause, 'cause you know... <i>Banks</i>, man.
ANYA: Look at them, researching demons for the billionth time. They need a peppy boost of happy news.
XANDER: (stands) You're right. I'll tell them. (sits) Soon as Buffy and Willow come in.
ANYA: Chicken.
XANDER: Would you stop?
ANYA: Dare you.
XANDER: Anya, if I tell them we're engaged right after you dared me to ... wouldn't you always wonder if that's the only reason I did it?
ANYA: Oh.
XANDER: Score one for Captain Logic.
ANYA: No, no. Captain Logic is not steering this tugboat. I smell Captain Fear at the wheel! God, I hate this. This tone in my voice? I dislike it more than you do, and I'm-closer to it!
DAWN: Oh come on, Tara. I am so old enough to do research. Do you really think I'm not mature enough?
TARA: I think you're way mature for your age, but you're still only fifteen.
DAWN: Right, fif-<i>teen</i>. As in "teenager." You know if you don't let me look at the pictures, I'm gonna learn everything I know about demons on the street.
TARA: Knock yourself out.
DAWN: Thank you. See? No biggie. I can totally handle it.
XANDER: I still don't get it. I mean, what kind of demon robs a bank?
ANYA: The kind that wants money.
XANDER: What do you even call that?
DAWN: This.
XANDER: Or maybe "MuhFashnik" like "Muh... Fashnik."
DAWN: This your guy?
BUFFY: (to Dawn) You do research now? You want a cappuccino, maybe a pack of cigarettes to go with that?
DAWN: Would you just look at the picture?
XANDER: Doesn't exactly fit the profile of your typical bank robber.
BUFFY: Maybe they turned down his loan application. (beat) That's him. Big, bad ... this thing was strong, guys. No weapons I could see but ...
GILES: My God, Buffy. You're alive. You're here. And you're still ... (strained) Remarkably strong.
BUFFY: Huh? Oh. Sorry.
GILES: Willow told me, but I didn't really let myself believe ...
BUFFY: I take some getting used to. <u>I'm</u> still getting used to me.
GILES: It's ... you're a ...
BUFFY: A miracle?
GILES: Yes. But then, I've always thought so.
GILES: So ...
BUFFY: I can start. How was England? (beat) How was life?
GILES: I'm not sure how to answer that. I arrived home. Met with the council.
BUFFY: Tons of fun.
GILES: (nods) Other than that, there wasn't much to report. I keep a flat in Bath. Saw a few old friends and almost made a new one, which I believe is statistically impossible for a man my age.
BUFFY: And now you're back.
GILES: Yes.
BUFFY: Wow. Giles, are you miserable about it, or just really British?
GILES: I can't lie to you, Buffy. It was difficult leaving Sunnydale. And coming back was...
BUFFY: I'm guessing the word is "inconvenient."
GILES: You know that doesn't matter.
BUFFY: Me? Nah. Fine. (then) I mean, yeah, sleeping's hard, but just because of that whole waking up in a box thing. So maybe it's waking up that's the problem. But only for a second. I sleep okay. Great even, except, you know ... for the dreams ...
GILES: You seem to be doing remarkably well under extreme circumstances. I'm proud of you.
BUFFY: Well, actually, it wasn't me. Willow brought me back. I just lay there.
GILES: Yes. I only meant-
BUFFY: I know what you meant. Just a little post post-mortem comedy... (then) Better start prepping. The slayage.
GILES: There is always that, isn't there?
BUFFY: Seems that way.
ANYA: Giles! God, we are so glad to see you. We missed you. You can't have the store back.
GILES: I know.
ANYA: You signed papers.
GILES: I did, and do we have information on this Demon I suddenly find so desperately interesting?
XANDER: That we do.
WILLOW: This one robs banks.
DAWN: I found him.
GILES: (examining book) M'Fashnik. Oh.
DAWN: Aha! Like Mmm Cookies.
GILES: No, quite different, actually.
TARA: You know it?
GILES: By reputation. It comes from a long line of mercenary demons, known to perform acts of mayhem and slaughter for the highest bidder.
XANDER: Well it is the American way.
GILES: Mmm. But now the question becomes: what's out there powerful enough to control one of these things?
DEMON: We had a deal. You got what you wanted. Now give me what I want. The head of the Slayer.
WARREN: Okay.
JONATHAN: Sure.
ANDREW: We can do that.
DEMON: You hired me to create carnage and chaos for you. You told me you were powerful men, commanding machines, magicks and the demon realms below.
WARREN: We are.
ANDREW: Yuh-<i>huh</i>.
JONATHAN: We're like, Super Villains.
DEMON: Which of you is leader?
ALL: I am.
DEMON: I will kill your leader.
ALL: He is.
DEMON: I will kill you all.
JONATHAN: Wait - no fair! It's not our fault the Slayer was there. We said we'd pay you, and we're gonna.
WARREN: Yes! Truly, Lord Jonathan is wisest of us all.
ANDREW: Uh, yeah, long live our noble Lord and Master.
JONATHAN: Oh, you guys suck. Hkkk!
DEMON: You cannot pay me with paper, tiny king. For pitting me against the Slayer, I must kill you.
WARREN: Whoa, big guy, let's back things up a parsec. Now, if you kill us? Everybody loses. But - let us live, we give you ...
DEMON: Give me what?
JONATHAN: (choking) Name it.
WARREN: Between the three of us, we can do pretty much anything.
JONATHAN: Like, you want a spell to make you look super-cool to the other demons? I'm all over that action, my friend.
WARREN: Or? Just throwing it out there- robot girlfriend. Huh? For those long, lonely nights after a hard day's slaughter?
DEMON: (interested) You can do this?
ANDREW: Don't trust him. Robo-pimp daddy's all mouth.
WARREN: Shut up, Andrew! You're just mad I wouldn't build you Christina Ricci!
ANDREW: You owe me, man.
WARREN: Or else what? You'll train another pack of devil-dogs to ruin my prom? <i>Graduated</i>.
ANDREW: That wasn't me! How many times do I have to say it? The prom thing was my lame-o brother, Tucker.
JONATHAN: Yeah, well tell him I was at that prom.
ANDREW: Hello! Screen-wipe - new scene. I had nothing to do with the devildogs! I trained flying monkey-demons to attack the school play! School play, dude!
WARREN: That was cool.
JONATHAN: Yeah, everyone was like all, "Run, Juliet!"
DEMON: ENOUGH!!!
ANDREW: Okay.
JONATHAN: Done.
WARREN: One dead Slayer, coming up. Um, could you just give us a minute?
DEMON: (suspicious) For what?
WARREN: We just wanna really nail down the optimum method for us to wipe out that Slayer for you.
DEMON: Make sure it involves pain.
BUFFY: But they're all I got.
GILES: Think nothing of it.
BUFFY: They were mine when I was little. I couldn't find the guest sheets. Mom always did this stuff.
GILES: It's a little ... (catching himself) That's fine! I'll just ...
BUFFY: Pff. I blame the sofa. We need a real pull-out bed. The kind with no payments 'til two-thousand-and-infinity.
GILES: What?
BUFFY: Just, money stuff. Turns out Mom left me some and while I was dead? Got squandered on luxuries like food and clothing.
GILES: How bad is it?
BUFFY: Anya says bad. I'm kinda taking her word for it. Actually, I'm kinda trying to not think about it.
GILES: A sound policy. At least for tonight.
BUFFY: Yeah, I'll just put it out of my mind for awhile, take a break, get some perspective ... then wake up at four a.m. terrified.
GILES: Buffy, you may be putting too much pressure on yourself. To return from some unknown level of Hell ... it's only natural coming back would be a process.
BUFFY: In the meantime, I'm scaring people.
GILES: That may take some time, too.
BUFFY: Good. I've always hoped to freak out the people who love me. And not just in the short-term, but you know - as a lifestyle.
GILES: If it's any consolation, life can get overwhelming even for people who haven't been ... where you have.
BUFFY: I guess, but I don't know, Giles, I mean ... stuff like spoons are still weird to me. Then you add complex financial issues on top of that, and - Buffy go bye-bye.
GILES: Perhaps you should just go night- night instead.
BUFFY: (smiles) Was that meant to be soothing?
GILES: (nods) And it became a debacle of epic proportions. (beat) But - Tomorrow, you and I can sit down together and go over everything. Every bill, one by one. We'll work it out together.
BUFFY: I'm glad you're back.
GILES: Well. I'm glad you are too.
WARREN: Shut up, Whine-athan.
ANDREW: But I don't want to kill Buffy, either!
JONATHAN: Yeah, she saved my life a bunch of times. Plus - she's hot.
WARREN: It's her or us. We have to do it.
ANDREW: You're talking about murder.
WARREN: I'm talking about staying alive, and this is my Mom's house so I think what I say goes.
ANDREW: But, aside from the moral issues? And the mess? We can get in trouble for murder.
WARREN: <i>Dur</i>! Last I checked, the authorities frown on bank robbery too, genius.
JONATHAN: I'm not even sure we could kill Buffy. She's got super-strength.
ANDREW: And, you know ... killing people ... This isn't why we got together in the first place.
JONATHON: Yeah. We teamed up with one clear, super-cool mission statement. Remember?
WARREN: So ... you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?
JONATHAN: Okay.
WARREN: Of course I remember. It was last month.
JONATHAN: Then you know we have a mission.
ANDREW: Me too. Ixnay on the urder-may.
WARREN: Vote. JONATHAN Okay. Who's for not killing Buffy?
ANDREW: Agreed.
JONATHAN: So what do we do about this M'Fashnik guy?
WARREN: Wait here. I got an idea.
JONATHAN: How'd you make him do that?
ANDREW: Yeah, what are you, some kind of Jedi?
WARREN: (shrugs) The force can sometimes have great power on the weak-minded.
WILLOW: Hey Giles.
GILES: Yes, now that she's back.
WILLOW: Isn't it awesome?
GILES: Mmm. Tell me about this spell you performed.
WILLOW: (suddenly excited) Okay. First of all - so scary. Like, the Blair Witch would have had to watch like this. (covers eyes) And this giant snake came out my mouth and then there was all this energy crackling and then this pack of demons interrupted but I totally kept it together and the next thing you know ... Buffy.
GILES: (sadly, quiet) You're a very stupid girl.
WILLOW: What? Giles ...
GILES: Do you have any idea what you've done? The forces you've harnessed? The lines you've crossed?
WILLOW: I thought you'd be ... (swallows) ...impressed, or something.
GILES: Oh, don't worry, you've made a deep impression. Of everyone here - you were the one I trusted most to respect the forces of nature.
WILLOW: Are you saying you don't trust me?
GILES: Think what you've done to Buffy.
WILLOW: I brought her back!
GILES: At incredible risk.
WILLOW: Risk? Of what? Making her deader?
GILES: Killing us all. Unleashing a hell on Earth. Shall I go on?
WILLOW: No! Giles, I did what I had to do. I did what nobody else could do.
GILES: Oh, there are others in the world who can do what you did. You just don't want to meet them.
WILLOW: Okay, probably not - but they're bad guys. I am not a bad guy. I brought Buffy back to the world and maybe the word you should be looking for is "congratulations."
GILES: Having Buffy back in the world makes me feel indescribably wonderful - but I wouldn't congratulate you if you jumped off a cliff and happened to survive.
WILLOW: That's not what I did, Giles!
GILES: You were lucky.
WILLOW: I wasn't lucky, I was amazing. How would you know anyway? You weren't even there.
GILES: (almost yelling) If I had been I'd have bloody well stopped you! The Magicks you channeled are more primal and ferocious than you can hope to understand, and you're lucky to be alive, you rank, arrogant amateur.
WILLOW: You're right. The Magicks I used are incredibly powerful. <i>I'm</i> incredibly powerful. (beat) And maybe it's not such a good idea for you to piss me off.
GILES: We still have no idea where she was or what happened to her.
BUFFY: Hello, Spike.
SPIKE: You hear all that noise?
BUFFY: Just enough to make me feel crappy.
SPIKE: You know watcher-boy doesn't mean anything by it.
BUFFY: I guess. Everyone's all ... they all care. They all care so much, it makes it all harder.
SPIKE: Not sure I followed 'round that bend, love.
BUFFY: I don't know. I just feel like, like I'm spending all my time trying to be okay, so no one'll worry. It's exhausting, and then I get all ... (can't find the words)
SPIKE: ... and that makes 'em worry even more.
BUFFY: Why are you always around when I'm miserable?
SPIKE: 'Cause that's when you're alone, I reckon. I'm not much for crowds myself these days.
BUFFY: Me neither.
SPIKE: That works out nicely then.
BUFFY: So, you know anything about finances?
GILES: Can't sleep?
DAWN: Not really. You?
GILES: Evidently not.
DAWN: You ever try mixing parts of every cereal you got together in one bowl?
GILES: Does it work?
DAWN: (shrugs) Gonna find out. You want to join the experiment?
GILES: Perhaps I'll be the control group. As you get older you'll find you lose patience with throwing ... up ...
DAWN: Should be.
DEMON: You're not the Slayer. But you'll do for a start.
DEMON: Ahhh!
BUFFY: You're paying for that door, buddy!
DEMON: You have cost me, Slayer.
BUFFY: I cost you? That's a designer lamp, ya mook!
BUFFY: Gahh!
SPIKE: More knives?
BUFFY: Less breakables.
SPIKE: (huh?) Good thinking.
BUFFY: Open the door! The basement!
DEMON: I have been looking forward to this, Slayer.
BUFFY: No!
SPIKE: Whoa. Did you know this place was flooded?
WARREN: We got the money. We got the lair. And our one loose end has been taken care of by the Slayer.
ANDREW: Periscope's working. Your mom's weeding tulips again.
JONATHAN: Action figures - fully deployed.
ANDREW: I still can't believe it. We did it! We can do anything. We, we can stay up all night if we wanna.
WARREN: Whoa, whoa, don't get all crazy on us, Andrew.
ANDREW: (hurt) I'm only saying ...
JONATHAN: But what are we ' gonna do about Buffy? You know sooner or later, the Slayer's gotta come after us.
ANDREW: Bring her on.
WARREN: We could hypnotize her.
ANDREW: Make her our willing sex bunny.
JONATHAN: I'm putting that on the list.
ANDREW: Is this the life or what? I mean, here we got all the stuff we ever wanted, and we didn't have to ...
WARREN: Earn it?
ANDREW: Exactamundo.
JONATHAN: It's true, my friends. Way I see it, life is like an interstellar journey. Some go into hypersleep and travel at sub-light speeds, only to get where they're going after years of struggle, toil and hard, hard work. We, on the other hand ...
ANDREW: Blasted through the space-time continuum in a worm hole?
JONATHAN: (nods) Gentlemen ...
ANDREW: But everyone knows if the width of a worm hole's cavity is'a whole number of wavelengths plus a fraction of that wavelength, the coinciding particle activity collapses the infrastructure.
BUFFY: This is going to take forever, isn't it?
ANYA: Not forever. Just, a very long time.
BUFFY: I've trashed this house so many times. How did Mom pay for all this?
XANDER: For starters? She saved money with this crappy-ass coffee table.
ANYA: There is always that "charging" option.
BUFFY: No. I will definitely ... probably not be doing that.
GILES: Well, now I know I'm back in America as I've been knocked unconscious.
BUFFY: Aw. Poor lumpy Giles.
TARA: What do you think that demon wanted, anyway? (looking around) Aside from costing you a bundle.
BUFFY: Dunno. And now he's way too dead to answer that question. Wish we knew who hired him.
WILLOW: Maybe I could do a locator spell ...
XANDER: (very TV doctor) It's been four hours. I'm calling it, people. This coffee-table. It's gone. Damn it!
DAWN: Also the lamp's in critical condition.
TARA: The big problem here's that all the pieces are in pieces.
WILLOW: Let's take these out to the trash and give 'em a decent throwing out.
GILES: Buffy?
BUFFY: Giles. I don't think I can do this.
GILES: Yes, you can. Your mother dealt with this sort of thing all the time. She took one crisis at a time, without the aid of superpowers, and got through it all. So can you.
BUFFY: You sure?
GILES: I'm positive.
BUFFY: Who'd be calling? Everyone I know lives here. (as she goes) Be right back. We'll get into this. I want to kick financial obligation's ass.
DAWN: (matter-of-fact, to Giles) I bet it's creditors. The hounding has begun. I read about it. So ... you think we'll starve?
GILES: I very much doubt it.
DAWN: No chance I'll have to quit school and work assembling cheap toys in a poorly-ventilated sweatshop?
GILES: A poorly-ventilated ... What have you been reading?
BUFFY: Angel.
GILES: Is he in trouble?
BUFFY: He knows I'm ... He needs to see me. And I have to see him.
GILES: Yes, of course. You'll leave for L.A. tomorrow?
BUFFY: (shakes her head) Not L.A. And not here. We'll meet in the middle. There's a place...
GILES: I see. Well, we'd better get these bills and things out of the way before you ...
BUFFY: I gotta go now.
