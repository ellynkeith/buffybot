And a big Sunnydale round of applause for Tito the amazing. Plumber extraordinaire.
Like we should start gathering up two of every animal.
Hey, Tito cut you a good deal down there. Those are his bargain prices. I did a little haggling for you.
As in, your being almost out of it.
Which should have left you covered, but - hospital bills.
(reluctantly) Action is his reward.
What are you talking about? Not on your side? Anya! I <i>am</i> your side!
Anya, come on! Wait up. What's wrong with you?
I'm supportive! I'm totally supportive! I'm a flying buttress of support!
This is because I haven't told-them about our engagement yet. Isn't it?
Anya, I promise, your waiting days are almost over. I know it's frustrating, but the way I understand this marriage thing? It's kind of a forever deal.
Yes.
Because. I'm still getting used to the miracle of a steady paycheck. Getting out of my parents' house. This? The husband thing? It's a big step. or, maybe a lot of little ones. And I love you so much, I want to get each one just right.
Anya-
(stands) You're right. I'll tell them. (sits) Soon as Buffy and Willow come in.
Would you stop?
Anya, if I tell them we're engaged right after you dared me to ... wouldn't you always wonder if that's the only reason I did it?
Score one for Captain Logic.
I still don't get it. I mean, what kind of demon robs a bank?
What do you even call that?
Or maybe "MuhFashnik" like "Muh... Fashnik."
Doesn't exactly fit the profile of your typical bank robber.
That we do.
Well it is the American way.
For starters? She saved money with this crappy-ass coffee table.
(very TV doctor) It's been four hours. I'm calling it, people. This coffee-table. It's gone. Damn it!
