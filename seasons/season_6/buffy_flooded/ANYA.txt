Which you're still hemorrhaging, by the way.
Not you. The house. See, this house, just sitting here, doing nothing, in itself costs money.
I know how.
Slaying vampires! You provide a valuable service to the whole community. I say, cash in.
It's not so crazy.
Spider Man does.
Does too.
Why are you never on my side?
Why don't you ask your best friend Spider Man? You know, if you're not going to support me --
No you're not.
No. Maybe. Yes! It's painful and confusing. First you buy me this beautiful ring and then I can't even wear it in public.
Not if you never get started. Don't you want to get married?
So why won't you tell them?
Really?
When are you going to grow up, Xander?
Look at them, researching demons for the billionth time. They need a peppy boost of happy news.
Chicken.
Dare you.
Oh.
No, no. Captain Logic is not steering this tugboat. I smell Captain Fear at the wheel! God, I hate this. This tone in my voice? I dislike it more than you do, and I'm-closer to it!

Giles! God, we are so glad to see you. We missed you. You can't have the store back.
You signed papers.
Not forever. Just, a very long time.
There is always that "charging" option.
