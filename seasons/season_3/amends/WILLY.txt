Hey, it's <b>the Slayer</b>! What brings <b>the Slayer</b> down here?
Keeping out of trouble, as God is  my witness. What can I do you  for? Couple drinks?
(thinks) Doesn't ring a bell.
Hey! Why with the threats? You drive away my customers, give me a  hard time and I don't know this First  guy!
I'm not sure...
I really don't want to say anything that would get me in trouble.
Well, I heard a few things, you know, from the underground.
Yeah, you know: from things that live under the ground. Apparently there's been a lot of migrations out of Sunnydale from the lower inhabitants. Something's scaring them off, and these are things that are not easily scared. could be your priest-types are underground. If the First is as bad as you say.
I do not know. (off her look) Hey, my ass is on the line for telling you that much. If I knew more, I'd say.
(to Xander) Hey, you did great by the way. I  was very intimidated by you.
Hey kid! (she turns back) Merry Christmas.
