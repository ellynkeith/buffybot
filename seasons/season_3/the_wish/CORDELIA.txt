Good call. Most people around here can't tell Prada from Payless.
Xander who?
Absolutely. I'm ready to ride.
Perfect! Lead the way.
(sweetly) Hey John Lee - do I have something caught in my teeth?
So - what's new? It's been, like, A gazillion years.
(stunned) What?
Go ahead - dazzle me with your Oh So Brilliant insult. Join the crowd.
But, Harmony-
Tell me about it.
Is it Gucci?
Too bad. I didn't have one of Those Pre-Xander.
Seconded.
I'm not even thinking of him. I'm past it. Living my life.
I don't wish. I act. Starting now, Xander Harris is going to get a bellyful1 of just how over him I am.
Did Xander send you to beg for him? because if he did-
Never been better.
You know what I need? To be rid of Xander and all things Xander - like his spooky entourage.
You know what I've been asking myself a lot this last week? Why me? Why do I get impaled? Why do I get bitten by snakes? Why do I fall for incredible losers!? (then) And I think I've finally figured it out. What my problem is. It's-
-Buffy Summers. That's when all my troubles started. When she moved here.
Oh - I pulled some stitches last night. Know why?
Surprise! It was Buffy's fault!
Yeah, I could use some luck -- and a big stick with pointy sharp bits. If that Buffy wasn't a slayer, I swear-
(interrupting) I never would have looked twice at Xander if Buffy hadn't made him marginally cooler by hanging with him.
Oh, yeah. I swear... (beat) I wish Buffy Summers had never Come to Sunnydale.
Anya?
"I wish Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale."
She was, like, a good fairy. A scary, veiny - good fairy...
(coolly) Yes?
I'll get back to you.
I do? I mean, I do. (as they leave) So what's this winterbrunch thing?
What's the rush? You're booking like your Daddy's visa is about to expire.
Since when? Aren't we going out?
Curfew? Come on... I'm in a good mood, let's go to the Bronze.
(thinks she gets it) Oh, the Bronze isn't cool in this reality. Gotta make these little adjustments.
You're right. I'm just... well you know I bumped my head yesterday and I'm just forgetting all kinds of stuff. (then/conspiratorially) Not that I care, but - Xander Harris is miserable, right? And that Willow freak he hangs with? She's not even a blip on the radar screen - right?
Okay. Not funny!
Hey! You! Where'd you put my car!?
My auto!? El convertab-lo?
What?
What is this - some kind of sick joke? Harmony told me you were dead.
Whatever. Just - listen to me. We have to find Buffy. She'll figure out a way to save us. She was supposed to be here and - as much as it kills to say it - things were better when she was around-
No. Buffy the Dog Faced Girl. Duh! Who do you think I'm talking about?
What - what is up with you two And the leather?
(stepping back) What's going on?
No. No way! I wished us into bizarro land and you guys are still together? I can not win!
Giles. It's my fault. I wasn't- I made this stupid wish-
No! You have to get Buffy. Buffy changes it. It wasn't like this. It was better. I mean, the clothes alone... But people were happy - mostly - and... (then) Wait. Why are you here? And she's not.. I mean, you were her watcher.
What?
I wish Buffy Summers had never Come to Sunnydale...
(amused) That'd be cool.
No wait - I wish Buffy Summers Was never born.
And I wish Xander Harris never again knows the touch of a woman. And that Willow wakes up tomorrow covered in monkey hair.
In fact - I wish all men - except maybe the dumb, really agreeable kind - would just disappear off the face of the Earth... That would be cool... Or maybe...
