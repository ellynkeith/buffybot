(giving "air kiss") Cordelia. You look amazing.
You have to meet Anya. She just moved here. Her dad bought - what was it? A utility or something.
God - Cordy, when I heard about... I mean, I just couldn't believe it. But it was smart - the "injury" thing? You take a week off. Let everybody forget the temporary insanity that was Xander Harris...
Then I have the stallion. He's so you.
I'm pretty sure he won't cheat on you. At least not for a while. (then) Plus - he's got a kill moped.
Loved the look last night, Cor. Dumpster chic for the dumped.
Where've you been!? Ted Chervin just totally went for third with Ginger - in front of everybody!
Cordy, you reign.
Oh, you know. My mom freaks if I'm late.
Is that a joke?
Cordy, what's with you? You wear this "come bite me" outfit, you make jokes about the Bronze, you're acting a little skitzo.
(no duh) Well - yeah. They're dead.
