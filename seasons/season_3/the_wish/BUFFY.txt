Knurrppppph!
Okay. That was too close for comfort. Not that slaying is ever comfy... (then) But you know what I mean. If you guys hadn't been here to help-
I guess these guys don't. We'll have to bury him or something. Makes you appreciate vampires. No muss, no fuss.
Couldn't reach her -- again. She hasn't been hanging out much. Off by herself.
Little bit. Slaying's a hard gig -- too much alone time isn't always healthy. Stuff gets pent up.
You got plans?
No luck reaching Cordelia?
Your logic does not resemble our Earth-logic.
That's right. Focus on school. Focus on yourself. That's the strong Willow way to heal.
That works too.
I know the feeling.
I have you guys.
How's it going?
What about Cordy? Has Xander seen her?
How was she?
I don't know, Xand. I'm here for you. I'm supporto gal. But I feel kind of funny doing the "us against Cordelia" thing. She's had a rough time.
It's true. We're young and free in America... How dare we be spun by love - or the lack of same?
That didn't work. Who wants chocolate?
Hey, Cordelia? Wait up.
I'm a free agent, I promise. I just wanted to see how you are.
No - hey... I was just going to say - if there's anything I can do... If you need anything-
Please. Cordelia. I know what it's like to be hurt by someone. Hurt so much - you think you're not going to make it.
The only thing that helped? I told my friends how I felt. And it got a little better.
Do you mind? We were talking!
Cordy, look --
-- out.
That's right...
Want to tell me what I'm doing here?
Great. What's her powercenter?
Why don't I put a stake through her heart?
You'd be surprised how many Things that'll kill.
You're taking a lot on faith here, Jeeves.
Kill the bad fairy -- or destroy the bad fairy's powercenter, whatever -- and all the troubles go away.
World is what it is. We fight and we die. Wishing doesn't change that.
Go ahead. I have to live in this one.
She was probably just a big fan.
The Master.
(incredulous) You know where he lives? And nobody's even tried to take him out?
Well, point the way. Might as well do some good while I'm here.
You wanna stay here and play make believe, fine -- I'm not gonna be any help to you anyway. There's one thing I'm good at. The kill.
I don't play well with others. Now I'm gonna ask you once, and then I'm gonna become cranky. Where's this club?
(cutting him off/suspicious) How did you know my name?
You were gonna help me.
Is this a "get in my pants" thing? You Sunnydale guys all talk like I'm the second coming.
I don't have time for stories. Where's the Master?
Factory?
You've got to be kidding.
No, you'll leave that to your Master.
Don't fall on this.
