WILLOW: Oh, God, Oh, God - Demon, demon - what kills a demon?!
BUFFY: Knurrppppph!
WILLOW: Oh! Nurf? Not nurf! Knife!
BUFFY: Okay. That was too close for comfort. Not that slaying is ever comfy... (then) But you know what I mean. If you guys hadn't been here to help-
WILLOW: (shaken) But we were. And we did. And we're all fine. (re: demon) Isn't he gonna go poof?
BUFFY: I guess these guys don't. We'll have to bury him or something. Makes you appreciate vampires. No muss, no fuss.
XANDER: How come Faith was a no show? I thought the mucussy demons were her favorites.
BUFFY: Couldn't reach her -- again. She hasn't been hanging out much. Off by herself.
XANDER: I detect worry.
BUFFY: Little bit. Slaying's a hard gig -- too much alone time isn't always healthy. Stuff gets pent up.
WILLOW: We should try to do more socializing with her.
XANDER: Well, burial detail aside, does this cap us off for the day?
BUFFY: You got plans?
XANDER: I cannot stress enough how much I don't have plans.
BUFFY: No luck reaching Cordelia?
XANDER: I left a few messages, sixty or seventy... (suddenly soapboxy) And you know what bugs me? Okay, we were kissing, it's wrong, but I know that was positively the last time we ever would have kissed.
WILLOW: Darn tootin'.
XANDER: And they burst in, rescuing us without even knocking, I mean this is really all their fault.
BUFFY: Your logic does not resemble our Earth-logic.
XANDER: (sheepishly) Mine is more advanced.
WILLOW: At least tomorrow's Monday. Another school day.
BUFFY: That's right. Focus on school. Focus on yourself. That's the strong Willow way to heal.
WILLOW: Actually -- I was more thinking "Oz will be there and I can beg for forgiveness."
BUFFY: That works too.
WILLOW: I want to be strong Willow. But then when I think I might not ever get to be close to Oz again... it's like all the air goes out of the room.
BUFFY: I know the feeling.
XANDER: Right. You've been through it all with Angel and you're still standing. So, tell us, wise one, how do you deal?
BUFFY: I have you guys.
BUFFY: How's it going?
WILLOW: Oz hasn't been to his locker. There may be books in there that he needs, but still he doesn't come.
BUFFY: What about Cordy? Has Xander seen her?
WILLOW: I don't think so. But she is coming in today. Amy saw her last night at the mall.
BUFFY: How was she?
WILLOW: I don't know. Amy said she looked pretty scary.
HARMONY: (giving "air kiss") Cordelia. You look amazing.
HARMONY: You have to meet Anya. She just moved here. Her dad bought - what was it? A utility or something.
ANYA: Nice bag. Prada?
CORDELIA: Good call. Most people around here can't tell Prada from Payless.
ANYA: What can I say? I have an eye for the good stuff.
HARMONY: God - Cordy, when I heard about... I mean, I just couldn't believe it. But it was smart - the "injury" thing? You take a week off. Let everybody forget the temporary insanity that was Xander Harris...
CORDELIA: Xander who?
CORDELIA: Absolutely. I'm ready to ride.
HARMONY: Then I have the stallion. He's so you.
CORDELIA: Perfect! Lead the way.
HARMONY: I'm pretty sure he won't cheat on you. At least not for a while. (then) Plus - he's got a kill moped.
WILLOW: Oz! wow. Look at us. Running into each other - as two people who go to the same school are so likely to do now and then...
OZ: Hey.
WILLOW: Oz. Wait. Please. I don't want to - but I'm capable of scene-making. Hallway scene making.
WILLOW: Okay. Okay. (then) I can't even... What I did - when I think that I hurt you...
OZ: You said all this stuff already.
WILLOW: Right. But... I want to make it up to you. I mean, if you'll let me -I want to try.
OZ: Just - you can leave me alone. I need to figure things out.
WILLOW: Figuring. That's something. It means there's still a me and you to figure.
OZ: I don't know.
WILLOW: But - if we talk now. Maybe we could-
OZ: I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this. But I told you what I need.
OZ: So I can't help feeling like the reason you want to talk is so you can feel better about yourself.
OZ: (then) And that's not my problem.
CORDELIA: (sweetly) Hey John Lee - do I have something caught in my teeth?
CORDELIA: So - what's new? It's been, like, A gazillion years.
LEE: Look. The guys are kind of down on me right now. Coach just cut me back to second string. If anybody saw me hanging with Xander Harris' cast off on top of that... Death - you know? (then) But, maybe, if you want to go someplace private...
CORDELIA: (stunned) What?
LEE: Think about it.
ANYA: Hey-
CORDELIA: Go ahead - dazzle me with your Oh So Brilliant insult. Join the crowd.
ANYA: (genuinely surprised) Hardly. I've been looking for you. When we met this morning, I was like - thank God! There's one other person in town who actually reads "W".
CORDELIA: But, Harmony-
ANYA: Follows me around. It's like, if she had an original thought her head would explode.
CORDELIA: Tell me about it.
ANYA: And she's all tweeked about some guy you were dating? Have we finished seventh grade already?
CORDELIA: Is it Gucci?
ANYA: No. It's an actual old thing - a good luck charm my dad gave me.
CORDELIA: Too bad. I didn't have one of Those Pre-Xander.
ANYA: Can I just say: Men.
CORDELIA: Seconded.
ANYA: Apart from being without class, the guy's obviously blind. Deserves whatever he gets.
CORDELIA: I'm not even thinking of him. I'm past it. Living my life.
ANYA: I know, but don't you kind of wish he'd --
CORDELIA: I don't wish. I act. Starting now, Xander Harris is going to get a bellyful1 of just how over him I am.
XANDER: Excuse me? I need to be both giving and receiving mirth. Is it too much to ask for a little back up?
BUFFY: I don't know, Xand. I'm here for you. I'm supporto gal. But I feel kind of funny doing the "us against Cordelia" thing. She's had a rough time.
WILLOW: (stricken) It's true. Cordy belongs to the "justified" camp. She should make us pay. And pay and pay and pay and pay... In fact, there's really not enough "pay" to make up for-
XANDER: (cutting her off) You want to do guilt-a-palooza? Fine. But I'm done with that. Starting this minute - I'm going to grab a hold of that crazy little thing called life and let it do it's magic heal-y thing. What's done is done. Let's be in the moment. Behold the beauty that is now! Who's with me?
BUFFY: It's true. We're young and free in America... How dare we be spun by love - or the lack of same?
WILLOW: (trying) Absolutely. It's self indulgent. I'm in. I'm on the joy train.
BUFFY: That didn't work. Who wants chocolate?
XANDER: Look at her. Tears of a clown, baby. Or, more like, grins of a sad person. Or is it-
WILLOW: Xander. Your hand.
XANDER: Oops. Sorry. (thinks it over) But why - "oops?" We've always touched digits. It's just friend stuff. Comfort - like chocolate.
WILLOW: Maybe it used to be. But now that we... It's different. (off his look) I'm sorry. But if I ever want to make things right with Oz - my hands, my... everything - they have to be for him only.
BUFFY: Hey, Cordelia? Wait up.
CORDELIA: Did Xander send you to beg for him? because if he did-
BUFFY: I'm a free agent, I promise. I just wanted to see how you are.
CORDELIA: Never been better.
BUFFY: No - hey... I was just going to say - if there's anything I can do... If you need anything-
CORDELIA: You know what I need? To be rid of Xander and all things Xander - like his spooky entourage.
BUFFY: Please. Cordelia. I know what it's like to be hurt by someone. Hurt so much - you think you're not going to make it.
BUFFY: The only thing that helped? I told my friends how I felt. And it got a little better.
BUFFY: Do you mind? We were talking!
BUFFY: Cordy, look --
BUFFY: -- out.
CORDELIA: You know what I've been asking myself a lot this last week? Why me? Why do I get impaled? Why do I get bitten by snakes? Why do I fall for incredible losers!? (then) And I think I've finally figured it out. What my problem is. It's-
CORDELIA: -Buffy Summers. That's when all my troubles started. When she moved here.
ANYA: You okay?
CORDELIA: Oh - I pulled some stitches last night. Know why?
CORDELIA: Surprise! It was Buffy's fault!
HARMONY: Loved the look last night, Cor. Dumpster chic for the dumped.
ANYA: Here. You need this more than I do right now.
CORDELIA: Yeah, I could use some luck -- and a big stick with pointy sharp bits. If that Buffy wasn't a slayer, I swear-
ANYA: She's a pain -- but Xander's an utter loser. Don't you wish --
CORDELIA: (interrupting) I never would have looked twice at Xander if Buffy hadn't made him marginally cooler by hanging with him.
ANYA: Really...
CORDELIA: Oh, yeah. I swear... (beat) I wish Buffy Summers had never Come to Sunnydale.
ANYA: Done.
CORDELIA: Anya?
CORDELIA: "I wish Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale."
CORDELIA: She was, like, a good fairy. A scary, veiny - good fairy...
HARMONY: Where've you been!? Ted Chervin just totally went for third with Ginger - in front of everybody!
LEE: Cordelia!
CORDELIA: (coolly) Yes?
LEE: Look, every guy on campus has probably asked, but I... well, if you're not going to the Winterbrunch with anyone... I'd sure be honored... and we'd have fun...
CORDELIA: I'll get back to you.
LEE: Really? Great.
HARMONY: Cordy, you reign.
CORDELIA: I do? I mean, I do. (as they leave) So what's this winterbrunch thing?
TEACHER: Okay... Again - the assignment is all the odd problems on page 27-
TEACHER: Don't forget. Tomorrow we have our monthly memorial, so there's no class.
CORDELIA: What's the rush? You're booking like your Daddy's visa is about to expire.
HARMONY: Oh, you know. My mom freaks if I'm late.
CORDELIA: Since when? Aren't we going out?
CORDELIA: Curfew? Come on... I'm in a good mood, let's go to the Bronze.
HARMONY: Is that a joke?
CORDELIA: (thinks she gets it) Oh, the Bronze isn't cool in this reality. Gotta make these little adjustments.
HARMONY: Cordy, what's with you? You wear this "come bite me" outfit, you make jokes about the Bronze, you're acting a little skitzo.
CORDELIA: You're right. I'm just... well you know I bumped my head yesterday and I'm just forgetting all kinds of stuff. (then/conspiratorially) Not that I care, but - Xander Harris is miserable, right? And that Willow freak he hangs with? She's not even a blip on the radar screen - right?
HARMONY: (no duh) Well - yeah. They're dead.
CORDELIA: Okay. Not funny!
CORDELIA: Hey! You! Where'd you put my car!?
CARETAKER: Pardon?
CORDELIA: My auto!? El convertab-lo?
CARETAKER: You students aren't allowed to drive and you know it.
CORDELIA: What?
CARETAKER: Go on now, miss. You better get yourself inside before the sun sets.
XANDER: Well, what do you know? Cordelia Chase.
CORDELIA: What is this - some kind of sick joke? Harmony told me you were dead.
XANDER: Now why would she say something like that? Let's think...
CORDELIA: Whatever. Just - listen to me. We have to find Buffy. She'll figure out a way to save us. She was supposed to be here and - as much as it kills to say it - things were better when she was around-
XANDER: Buffy - the slayer?
CORDELIA: No. Buffy the Dog Faced Girl. Duh! Who do you think I'm talking about?
WILLOW: This is the part that's less fun, when there isn't any screaming.
CORDELIA: What - what is up with you two And the leather?
CORDELIA: (stepping back) What's going on?
WILLOW: Play now?
XANDER: Not that I don't appreciate your appetite, Will... But I thought we agreed it was my turn-
CORDELIA: No. No way! I wished us into bizarro land and you guys are still together? I can not win!
XANDER: Probably not-
XANDER: But I'll give you a head start.
WILLOW: I love this part.
XANDER: You love all the parts.
WILLOW: No fun. She didn't even hardly fight.
XANDER: Oh swell. It's the white hats.
GILES: (to Larry and Nancy) I've got them. Get the girl!
XANDER: Those people need to find some hobbies.
OZ: How's she doing?
GILES: Her pulse is strong.
NANCY: What was she doing wearing red? Everybody knows vampires are attracted to bright colors.
LARRY: That's Cordelia. It's better to look good than to feel... alive.
GILES: Go watch the perimeter - in case those vampires followed.
XANDER: (to a vamp buddy) Slap my hand, dead soul man...
MASTER: Ahhhh. Xander. Willow.
MASTER: Hungry? I lost my taste for this one. She kept looking at me. I'm trying to eat and she looks at me...
MASTER: (to Will) Go on.
MASTER: I remember that lust for the kill... (shrugs off the reverie/to Xander) So. Any news from the street?
XANDER: Had a prime kill -- an old crush, actually -- but that wannaslay librarian showed up. A sad loss.
MASTER: He'll be dealt with soon enough.
XANDER: Weird thing: Girl kept talking about Buffy, we had to get Buffy here. Isn't that what they call the Slayer?
WILLOW: Buffy. (mocking) Ooooh. Scary.
XANDER: Someone has to talk to her people. That name is striking fear in nobody's heart.
MASTER: This girl spoke of summoning a slayer here? Now, of all times? And you didn't kill her?
WILLOW: Well, they had crosses --
MASTER: The plant goes into operation in less than 24 hours! (deadly) You find that girl and kill her before she contacts the Slayer - or I'll see the both of you kissing daylight.
CORDELIA: Giles. It's my fault. I wasn't- I made this stupid wish-
GILES: Please. You must be still-
CORDELIA: No! You have to get Buffy. Buffy changes it. It wasn't like this. It was better. I mean, the clothes alone... But people were happy - mostly - and... (then) Wait. Why are you here? And she's not.. I mean, you were her watcher.
GILES: (amazed) How did you know I was a watcher, I never --
CORDELIA: What?
GILES: Thought I heard something.
GILES: I want you to start again and explain everything very carefully.
WILLOW: You're in a big cage.
XANDER: Not too bright, book guy.
XANDER: So you're a watcher, huh? (smiles) Watch this.
LARRY: They hit us right outside.
GILES: Nancy?
OZ: Dead.
GILES: Would you mind - could you take her body to the incinerator? I've got some business...
OZ: Yeah.
GILES: One moment.
XANDER: The deed is done.
MASTER: You killed the girl who was looking for the slayer?
XANDER: It was too easy.
WILLOW: I felt cheap.
MASTER: Excellent. The opening will commence as scheduled.
WILLOW: So - you're pleased?  MASTER Ecstatic.
WILLOW: Then... Can I play with the puppy?
MASTER: Be my guest.
GILES: (into phone/mid talk) ...yes, I understand, but it's imperative that I see her. Here. Well, when will you...? You are her watcher, I would think she'd at least check in to... Yes. I'm aware there is a great deal of demonic activity in Cleveland. It happens, you know, that Sunnydale is on a Hellmouth... it is so! (gives up) Just give her the message, if you ever see her again.
WILLOW: Bored now. (then) Daytime is the worst. Cooped up for hours. Can't hunt...
WILLOW: But the Master said I could play.
WILLOW: Isn't that fun, puppy?
WILLOW: Puppy's all quiet. Come on. Don't be a spoilsport.
WILLOW: I know you like it when I come.
WILLOW: Guess what today is? Today the plant opens, it's a big party. You remember I told you about the plant. All those people you tried to save... It'll be quick for them. Not for you, though. It's gonna be slow for you.
WILLOW: That's right, Puppy. Willow's gonna make you bark.
WILLOW: Oooh. Maybe I went too hard on you last time...
XANDER: Too hard? No such thing.
WILLOW: Watch it with those things. You almost got my hair.
XANDER: Sorry. Carried away.
WILLOW: (re: matches/to Xander) Don't you want to - ?
XANDER: (intense) No thanks, baby. I just want To watch you go.
GILES: Here it is. Look.
GILES: It's what Cordelia was wearing. The symbol of Anyanka.
OZ: Don't think I know her.
GILES: Anyanka raised a demon to ruin her unfaithful lover. The demon did her bidding - but then cursed her and turned her into a sort of... patron saint for scorned women. Apparently, the cry of a wronged woman is like a siren's call to Anyanka.
LARRY: What does she do?
GILES: She grants wishes.
OZ: Cordelia wished for something? If it was a long and healthy life, I think she should get her money back.
GILES: Well, she said something about everything being different. The world wasn't supposed to be like this. That it was... better... before. . .
LARRY: Okay, the entire world sucks because some dead ditz made a wish? I just wanna be clear.
GILES: I'm not sure. She said the Slayer was supposed to be here. To have been here already.
OZ: Well, that certainly woulda been helpful.
GILES: I've tried to contact her, but... (closes the book) I'm going to need to research this Anyanka further. I have some volumes at home... or, I think they're at home... I'm a little rusty with all this...
GILES: You two get some sleep.
OZ: Watch your back.
GILES: (to the would-be victims) Run!
GILES: Buffy Summers?
BUFFY: That's right...
BUFFY: Want to tell me what I'm doing here?
GILES: Aha! Here. (paraphrases) In order to defeat Anyanka, one must destroy her powercenter. This should reverse all the wishes she has granted, rendering her mortal and powerless again. (to Buffy) You see, without her powercenter she'll be just an ordinary woman again and all this will be different. (pleased) I'd say my watcher muscles are not completely atrophied after all.
BUFFY: Great. What's her powercenter?
GILES: Dyeh -- Ahhum, doesn't say.
BUFFY: Why don't I put a stake through her heart?
GILES: She's not a vampire.
BUFFY: You'd be surprised how many Things that'll kill.
GILES: I don't want to kill her, Miss Summers. Merely reverse whatever effect she has had on this world.
BUFFY: You're taking a lot on faith here, Jeeves.
GILES: Giles.
BUFFY: Kill the bad fairy -- or destroy the bad fairy's powercenter, whatever -- and all the troubles go away.
GILES: I'm sure it's not that simple, but...
BUFFY: World is what it is. We fight and we die. Wishing doesn't change that.
GILES: I have to believe in a better world.
BUFFY: Go ahead. I have to live in this one.
GILES: Cordelia knew that I was meant to be your watcher. She said she knew you --
BUFFY: She was probably just a big fan.
GILES: The Master sent his most vicious disciples to kill her. She must have posed some threat to him. He's up to something... those people being herded in vans -- I know he's behind it.
BUFFY: The Master.
GILES: Supreme vampire in these parts. Lives on the outskirts of town, in an old club.
BUFFY: (incredulous) You know where he lives? And nobody's even tried to take him out?
GILES: (deadpan) People have tried...
BUFFY: Well, point the way. Might as well do some good while I'm here.
GILES: You can't just walk in and --
BUFFY: You wanna stay here and play make believe, fine -- I'm not gonna be any help to you anyway. There's one thing I'm good at. The kill.
GILES: At least lets muster some kind of force --
BUFFY: I don't play well with others. Now I'm gonna ask you once, and then I'm gonna become cranky. Where's this club?
ANGEL: I - it's you. I mean, you don't remember - how could you? But-
BUFFY: (cutting him off/suspicious) How did you know my name?
ANGEL: I waited. I waited here for you. But you never... I was supposed to help you.
BUFFY: You were gonna help me.
ANGEL: The Master rose. He let me live - To punish me. I kept hoping - maybe you'd come. My destiny.
BUFFY: Is this a "get in my pants" thing? You Sunnydale guys all talk like I'm the second coming.
ANGEL: I'm... sorry. I just meant-
BUFFY: I don't have time for stories. Where's the Master?
ANGEL: They're at his factory. It starts tonight.
BUFFY: Factory?
ANGEL: (hopeful) I - I can take you there.
BUFFY: You've got to be kidding.
ANGEL: Wait! I won't hurt you.
BUFFY: No, you'll leave that to your Master.
ANGEL: You don't believe I want to help you. (he opens his shirt) Believe I want him dead.
MASTER: (mid-speech) Vampires! Undeniably, we are the world's superior race. Yet we have always been too parochial. Too bound to the mindless routine of the predator. Hunt and kill... Hunt and kill... Titillating? Yes. Practical? Hardly... Meanwhile -the humans, with their plebeian minds, have brought us a truly demonic concept: Mass production.
ANGEL: What's the plan?
BUFFY: Don't fall on this.
MASTER: The days of compromise, of living alongside the humans, are over. It's time to take them out. Time to treat them like... well, let's not mince words here -- like the cattle they are!
XANDER: (moved) We really are living in a golden age.
GILES: Anyanka, I beseech thee, uh...
GILES: In the name of all women scorned - come before me!
ANYANKA: DO you have any idea what I do to a man who uses that spell to summon me?
MASTER: Bring the first!
MASTER: (gleeful) She's still alive here, see? For freshness.
MASTER: Welcome to the future!
WILLOW: (re: Angel) Uh oh. Puppy got out.
GILES: Cordelia Chase. What did she wish for?
ANYANKA: (smiling) I had no idea her wish would be so... exciting. A brave new world. I hope she likes it.
GILES: She's dead.
ANYANKA: It happens.
GILES: You're going to change it back.
GILES: I'm not afraid of you. Your only power lies in the wishing.
ANYANKA: Wrong.
ANGEL: Buffy-
ANYANKA: This is the real world now. There's no going back. This is the world we made.
ANYANKA: Isn't it wonderful?
ANYANKA: No!
ANYANKA: Trusting fool! How do you know the other world is any better than this?
GILES: (almost to himself) Because it has to be.
CORDELIA: I wish Buffy Summers had never Come to Sunnydale...
ANYA: Done.
CORDELIA: (amused) That'd be cool.
CORDELIA: No wait - I wish Buffy Summers Was never born.
ANYA: Done!
CORDELIA: And I wish Xander Harris never again knows the touch of a woman. And that Willow wakes up tomorrow covered in monkey hair.
CORDELIA: In fact - I wish all men - except maybe the dumb, really agreeable kind - would just disappear off the face of the Earth... That would be cool... Or maybe...
