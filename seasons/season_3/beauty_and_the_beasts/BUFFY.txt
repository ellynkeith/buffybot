Naw. There's a smooch spot near the woods. That's where folks go.
Hardly. We've only been out a few times.
Well, yeah. I - (then) How low?
How 'bout - not? (then) But he is funny and nice and -
Blueberry. With that munchable, crumbly top. But my most favorite thing? So far, he doesn't seem to be some sort of hell beast.
Geez. I was sort of hoping not to sound that cynical until at least forty.
I know, it's awfully-
(pleased) Okay. Hey. 
We have a marching Jazz band?
Those are pretty.
No. We're pre-posie. Definitely.  (checks her watch; to Scott) I'd better go. Lucky me, I get to see  Mr. Platt today.
Yeah - I need to convince him I'm "Little Miss Stable" so I can stay in school.
(sincerely) But if God keeps telling me to kill - it  just seems snotty not to, you know?
See you.
Not a deal. We've kissed before.
So I'm good. Yeah. I think…..
Buffy Summers, reporting for sanity…look,  I know I have to do this and I'll cooperate,  look at ink blots, but I don't want to talk about my childhood or my life or…anything, actually, and I don't want to be friends -
Not too crazy. Those are your credentials?
Gotta say I'm with you on that one.
It's a long story.
I'm telling you - I'm so over it. I feel good. I'm moving on. I'm even dating someone new.
I was seeing this guy. It ended badly.  And my mom and I were fighting…. I kind of flipped.
He was the first person- I loved him. But then…
Yes.
Yes.
And if you can't?
I'm afraid to ask.
I'll patrol the woods. (to Willow and the others) You guys try to get into the morgue.
Oww - !
Bleeding internally. But I'll live.
I figured. Ow - again. (then) I came to give you the rest of the night off.
Can't sleep. Figured I'd cram for my French test.
Knock yourself out. But not literally.
Hey….
Hey! Can you believe Faith and  these nutty books?
I know! And she still listens to  heavy metal. Freaky deaky.
What if I told you…. I had a dream  about Angel. And it brought up some questions.
Yeah. I dreamt that he came back.
But this dream was vivid. Really vivid.  I mean, three-dimensional, sensurround,  the hills are alive-
You get my point.
(carefully) No. I don't know. It just made me wonder.  I mean - is there a chance, even? Could it happen?
Okay. But let's pretend - wacky world -  he somehow ended up here in Sunnydale  again. I mean, what would he be like?
Yeah. I remember… So, - Angel would have  been there for, like, close to a hundred years?
Of torture.
He'd be a monster. A lost cause.
And the second type?
Change of plans.
(interrupting) You couldn't sleep either?
Yeah - what happened with the inspection  of the body?
(anxious) Come on, Will. Was it a werewolf….. (quietly) Was it a vampire?
How could you not conclude? I mean,  what did it look like? Was he bit?
It's just…. Sorry.
My stomach doesn't want hard food.  There's fruit stuff in there.
Oh….. (then) I'm kinda out of it today. Didn't sleep well.
I sort of thought he was cool.
Yeah. He definitely marches to the beat  of his own drummer. In fact - I think  he makes his own drums.
God. That's incredibly -
-sweet…. And I wish I didn't have to…  But I just remembered… that I do…  I'll see you.
Angel? Can you - ?
Two o'clock, Buffy right. Don't turn  around and don't say anything. Just  listen. That's your thing, right? (with difficulty) Something's going on… I mean, the  whole entire story will probably convince  you I'm like, loony bin material. But I  can't tell anybody - not Willow, not Giles,  nobody… They'd just freak out on me or  maybe do something… And I'm… I need help. (near tears) I need to talk to someone. I'm so  scared. I - this guy, he…
… he's come back…
It's okay, Will. We're all glad  Oz is off the hook.
Good enough. And we know Debbie knew  Mr. Platt. She was seeing him and way vocal  about not having the love for the guy.
No, he was dead in an instant.  Didn't even lose his cigarette.
Could be - boyfriend Pete's the  one doling out the punishment.
It's tricky covering a fresh shiner like  that. You know what works?
Don't get hit.
What's going on, Debbie? I'd bet the farm you know.
Now - normally? I'd say - you want to  play "I have a secret" - fine. But people are dying.
You mean Pete.
Pete's… not like other guys, is he Debbie?
You have to talk to us. We can't  help you until you do.
Debbie. We're running out of time.
Where can we find him, Debbie?
You're lying.
Look at yourself. Why are you  protecting him?
Anybody who really loved you  couldn't do this to you.
Maybe. At best 50/50. Lame odds  when you're betting your life.
Probably.
(losing patience) Great. While you guys enjoy your  grim fairy-tale, two people are dead.  Who's gonna be next?
We'd better go - we have to find Pete.
(sadly) I think she was broken before this.
I'll take Pete.
Oh my God.
It's better than the estrogen theory.  I heard he took all his mother's  birth control pills.
Thing was, after a while, he didn't need  a potion to turn into the bad guy. He  got there on the natch.
Just himself.
I'd better…
I don't even know what to say  that won't sound stupid or obvious.
If there's anything I can do -
