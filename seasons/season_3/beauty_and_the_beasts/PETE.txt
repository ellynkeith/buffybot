What's that - like a Barbie thing? "Dear  Dream Journal, why hasn't Ken come around  since he got that earring…?"
Your Mom has the wattage of a Zippo lighter, Scott.
Check out Scott. Liking the manic-depressive chick.
Kidding, my friend. She's special.  Like two very hot girlfriends in one.
Come on - just for a minute…
What's with you today? Relax…
What is that?
You didn't drink that, did you?
Debbie… What's going on?
So - the bottle jumped out of the  cabinet and spilled on its own?
You were trying to get rid of it.
You think this has anything to  do with "how I get?"
When I drink it - nothing! I don't  need it anymore, Debbie. I'm past that now-
See? No more! You can pour out  everything I made and it won't help -  and you want to know why?
You know why?! Because all it takes  is you now, Debbie. You and your  stupid, grating voice-
You're the reason I started with the  formulas in the first place - to be the  man you wanted. And you pay me  back, how? You whore around with  other guys and taunt-
I was talking! Is that something your  shrink taught you, Debbie - to "share?"  To "communicate?" To piss me off!?
Well, guess what? Even he's not going  to listen to your pathetic ramblings anymore-
I'm all you've got, Debbie.  You hear me!? I'm all you've got!
Ah, hell. God…
Baby, you okay?
You know you shouldn't make  me mad. You know what happens.  (off her silence) Please, Debbie. You alright?
Since when do you touch my girl?
Guess you weren't thinking about that  when you put the moves on Debbie…
You won't be alive to see it.
Did you kiss that whore? Did she like it?
How does she know, Debbie.  Did you run your big mouth?
So you filled in the blanks.
But what did I expect from a  screw up like you?
Fact is, Debbie? You're nothing  but a waste of space.
All the same! You're all the same!
