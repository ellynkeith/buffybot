WILLOW: (reading) …going back into the wombs of time. The rabbit could not turn-…
XANDER: Private Harris reporting for Oz watch.
WILLOW: Xander - oh good….
XANDER: Call of the Wild. Aren't we reading the  Cliff Notes to this for English?
WILLOW: (gives him a look) Some of us are. Anyway, it'll help you stay awake.  It's good and very wolfy. And it seems to sooth the savage beast. Except the stuff about…. (glances at Oz / low whisper) Rabbits.
XANDER: Rabbits?
WILLOW: He gets sort of…over excited. (baby sitter talk) Now. He's already had his two o'clock feeding.  After sunrise, if he forgets where his clothes are -  They're on top of the file cabinet in his cage. And I put that towel up for privacy.
XANDER: No worries. I can handle the Oz full monty. (quickly) I mean - not handle, handle -  like "hands to flesh" handle.
WILLOW: It's not you I'm worried about. It's me. I'm still getting used to half a monty.
XANDER: Oh, good- (alarmed) Half? You and Oz? Which half?
WILLOW: (enjoying his wiggins) Wouldn't you like to know. (moving on) Okay - he's more manageable tonight and on  night three. Tomorrow - the total full moon?  That's the real howler. Still, if there's trouble  - there won't be - but, you know, if…
XANDER: Sleepy time. Gotchya.
WILLOW: Thanks again for doing this.  I wouldn't ask, but I have this test-
XANDER: No big. You can count on me. I got my coffee,  magazines…Figured I'd read, run the stairs here…. I'm good.
FAITH: You ever catch kids doing the  horizontal two-step out here?
BUFFY: Naw. There's a smooch spot near the woods. That's where folks go.
FAITH: Yeah? Bet you and Scott been out there Kicking the old gearshift.
BUFFY: Hardly. We've only been out a few times.
FAITH: But you like him, right? When you think about Him you get that good, down low tickle?
BUFFY: Well, yeah. I - (then) How low?
BUFFY: How 'bout - not? (then) But he is funny and nice and -
FAITH: -quite a muffin.
BUFFY: Blueberry. With that munchable, crumbly top. But my most favorite thing? So far, he doesn't seem to be some sort of hell beast.
FAITH: All men are beasts, Buffy.
BUFFY: Geez. I was sort of hoping not to sound that cynical until at least forty.
FAITH: Not cynical. Realistic. Every guy - from  "Manimal" right on down to "Mr. I Loved the  English Patient" - has beast in him. And I don't  care how sensitive they act - they're still just in it for the chase…..
BUFFY: I know, it's awfully-
SCOTT: Hey. (off her questioning look) That's what I stopped you for, basically. Hey.
BUFFY: (pleased) Okay. Hey. 
OZ: Howdy Debbie.
DEBBIE: Hi, Oz. Hey, you're not doing Jazz band this year?
OZ: Can't take the pressure. It's not the music that's hard, it's the marching.
BUFFY: We have a marching Jazz band?
OZ: Yeah. But - you know - good jazz is  improvisational. So we'd be marching off in all directions. Running into floats  and stuff. Scary. 
WILLOW: He's just being Oz.
OZ: Pretty much full time.
BUFFY: Those are pretty.
DEBBIE: Thanks. Pete brought them for me.
SCOTT: Oh. We're not up to flowers.  (suddenly anxious) Are we? Up to flowers? Did I miss flowers?
BUFFY: No. We're pre-posie. Definitely.  (checks her watch; to Scott) I'd better go. Lucky me, I get to see  Mr. Platt today.
DEBBIE: Platt? The school counselor?
BUFFY: Yeah - I need to convince him I'm "Little Miss Stable" so I can stay in school.
SCOTT: Stable. Okay. Topics to avoid. The little men that live in your teeth…. Your compulsion to paint circus clowns….
BUFFY: (sincerely) But if God keeps telling me to kill - it  just seems snotty not to, you know?
SCOTT: You'll do great.
DEBBIE: Platt creeps me out. I would totally quit going, but I'm flunking senior bio and my teacher says I have "success issues."
OZ: Senior bio? I sort of aced that final.
DEBBIE: Thanks. That'd be great.
BUFFY: See you.
SCOTT: Yeah. Good.
WILLOW: Okay. You. Scott. School kiss.
BUFFY: Not a deal. We've kissed before.
WILLOW: But in the dark. Alone. A school  kiss is a whole 'nother deal. It's  statement-y. it says - hey, peers -  we're smooching!
OZ: I thought it was right. It said "nice  seeing you" - not - "take me now." Not that I have anything against a  "take me now" kiss, mind you. But it's not very school.
WILLOW: Totally. That kind of kiss in school is all about showing off. The "haves" rubbing it in the faces of the "have-nots."
BUFFY: So I'm good. Yeah. I think…..
WILLOW: I'm not sure I completely understand. What was the first kind of kiss?
OZ: Oh. That would be the "nice seeing you kiss."
WILLOW: And - how does that go?
OZ: Nice seeing you. (then) Of course - it can be a fine line. The "nice to see you" kiss can easily morph into….
OZ: Really nice seeing you. And if you aren't careful, that becomes….
GILES: We'll have to re-check every possible exit avenue.
XANDER: I'm telling you, it's a waste of time. I was here all night - 
GILES: Right then. Good to see you. No need to panic.
OZ: (to Giles) Just a thought? Poker. Not your game.
WILLOW: What's the deal, Giles?
GILES: Now. Keep in mind - most likely -  there is no deal. But, if there was a deal it would concern a murder last night. A male student was found in the woods-
WILLOW: Which student?
GILES: Jeff Walken.
OZ: Jeff? He was - I know him.
GILES: I'm afraid… He was terribly mauled. And while I hate to think of it, it could  be the handiwork of-
WILLOW: Wolf you. Not you, you.
XANDER: But it's not. Not wolf you - or you you. Okay? The room was secure. The cage was locked. The window's unbreakable and-
XANDER: -open.
WILLOW: Oh, God.
XANDER: Hey. Not to freak. I rested my eyes now and then. That's all.
GILES: And how long - exactly - did you "rest your eyes" for?
XANDER: A little now. A little then. But I never heard Oz leave and he was here in the morning when I… when I - 
GILES: Woke up?
XANDER: If you want to put it that way, Mr. Technical.
WILLOW: Oh, God.
PLATT: The two o'clock. Buffy Summers.
BUFFY: Buffy Summers, reporting for sanity…look,  I know I have to do this and I'll cooperate,  look at ink blots, but I don't want to talk about my childhood or my life or…anything, actually, and I don't want to be friends -
PLATT: We're not going to be friends.
PLATT: You already have friends - I hope. A friend is a good thing. Likes you, agrees with you, tells you what you want to hear. What you do need is a trained, not-too-crazy professional who will always give you his  honest opinion. Which I offer you. (then) Have a seat.
BUFFY: Not too crazy. Those are your credentials?
PLATT: (points to certificates on the wall) Those are my credentials. Look, Buffy. Any person - grown up, shrink, pope, any  person who claims to be totally sane is either  lying or not very bright. Everybody has problems. Everyone has demons. Right?
BUFFY: Gotta say I'm with you on that one.
PLATT: Excellent. So, the hope I bring you is that demons can be fought. People can change. You can change. It's all about finding your strength. Believing in yourself (then) Now. Your turn. Let's start with why you ran away.
BUFFY: It's a long story.
PLATT: Bore me.
BUFFY: I'm telling you - I'm so over it. I feel good. I'm moving on. I'm even dating someone new.
PLATT: All nice things. But still - you're bringing me in at the end of the movie.
BUFFY: I was seeing this guy. It ended badly.  And my mom and I were fighting…. I kind of flipped.
PLATT: Tell me more about this guy. The bad-ending guy.
BUFFY: He was the first person- I loved him. But then…
PLATT: He changed.
BUFFY: Yes.
PLATT: He got mean.
BUFFY: Yes.
PLATT: But you didn't stop loving him. (off her silence) You know - lots of people lose themselves in love. It's no shame. They write songs about it. (then) The hitch is - you can't stay lost. Sooner or later, you have to get back to yourself.
BUFFY: And if you can't?
PLATT: If you can't - love becomes your master. And you're just it's dog.
BUFFY: I'm afraid to ask.
CORDELIA: Oz ate someone last night.
WILLOW: He did not!
XANDER: (to Cordy/stern) Oz does not eat people. It's more, werewolf  play. You know - I bat you around a little bit.  Like a cat toy. I have harmless wolf fun. Is it  Oz' fault that, you know, side effect, people get  cut to ribbons and maybe then he takes a little  nibble and I'm not helping am I?
GILES: (to Buffy) Oz may have gotten out of his cage last night - Oz cuts him off - his tone grim.
OZ: Or there just happened to be another werewolf  roaming the woods.
GILES: Perhaps. Or perhaps it was something else  entirely. Let's not overreact -
OZ: (frustrated) Good in theory. Not very helpful for the potential nibbler.
GILES: That's why we all have to work to find out  what happened.
BUFFY: I'll patrol the woods. (to Willow and the others) You guys try to get into the morgue.
WILLOW: Right, we can see if it's a werewolf kill or  not. But what about Oz?
GILES: Why don't we have Faith come watch over him?
OZ: You're having a slayer watch me? Good thing we're not over-reacting
OZ: Okay. You know that thing where you bail  in the middle of an upsetting conversation?  I need to do that. Kind of dramatic. But  sometimes it's a necessary guy thing.
WILLOW: And I want you to. Do the guy thing - but…
WILLOW: Oz….
OZ: Get away from the cage.
WILLOW: What?
OZ: It's going to happen soon. Get away from me.
WILLOW: (hands him a baggie) Here. Hold this open.
XANDER: We're doing crime, Cordy. You don't sneak up during crime!
CORDELIA: God. Have a - 
XANDER: I think both "scarred" and "life"  are moot for this fella, Cordy.
CORDELIA: Not him - me. Willow, how can you stand it?
XANDER: Yeah, Will. This guy is barf-worthy. Can't we be elsewhere? Is Oz cleared or what?
WILLOW: I'm not sure. I mean, there are a lot of  incised wounds - but they could be from anything. 
CORDELIA: Anything with really big, sharp teeth and - 
XANDER: Do you want to go back to the car and wait?
CORDELIA: What? I'm just saying-
WILLOW: Almost done. Let me just get a few stray  hairs off the body. They may be from the attacker….
XANDER: Great. So we got everything we need?
WILLOW: (to Xander) Yeah. That's it.
XANDER: (worried) Okay - little too much excitement for the Willster… (to Cordy) It doesn't look good for Oz, does it?
CORDELIA: (no duh) It really doesn't. This guy was ripped apart  by a wild animal.
BUFFY: Oww - !
FAITH: Buffy! Are you okay!? What are you doing here?
BUFFY: Bleeding internally. But I'll live.
FAITH: God, I'm sorry… I didn't hear you.
BUFFY: I figured. Ow - again. (then) I came to give you the rest of the night off.
FAITH: Get out of jail free, huh? How come?
BUFFY: Can't sleep. Figured I'd cram for my French test.
FAITH: Cool. I was going nuts in here. I bet I  can still get in a few good stakings before sunrise.
BUFFY: Knock yourself out. But not literally.
FAITH: Later.
BUFFY: Hey….
BUFFY: Hey! Can you believe Faith and  these nutty books?
GILES: "Exploring Demon Dimensions."  "The Mystery of Acathala…"
BUFFY: I know! And she still listens to  heavy metal. Freaky deaky.
GILES: Buffy.
BUFFY: What if I told you…. I had a dream  about Angel. And it brought up some questions.
GILES: I'd say it was to be expected. (re: card file) But it must have been quite a dream.  I didn't think you knew what these cards were for.
BUFFY: Yeah. I dreamt that he came back.
GILES: Of course. After Jenny was killed -  I had dreams that she was still alive.  That I saved her.
BUFFY: But this dream was vivid. Really vivid.  I mean, three-dimensional, sensurround,  the hills are alive-
BUFFY: You get my point.
GILES: Do you believe it was a prophecy?
BUFFY: (carefully) No. I don't know. It just made me wonder.  I mean - is there a chance, even? Could it happen?
GILES: There's no record of someone returning  from a demon dimension once the "gate"  has closed. I can't imagine how it would  happen or why.
BUFFY: Okay. But let's pretend - wacky world -  he somehow ended up here in Sunnydale  again. I mean, what would he be like?
GILES: I can't really say. What little is known  about the dimension accessed via Acathala  suggest a world of brutal torment. And  time in demon worlds moves quite different that here - 
BUFFY: Yeah. I remember… So, - Angel would have  been there for, like, close to a hundred years?
GILES: Yes.
BUFFY: Of torture.
GILES: (nods) Only a person with tremendous will and character  could survive that and retain any semblance of self.
BUFFY: He'd be a monster. A lost cause.
GILES: Maybe… Maybe not. In my experience,  there are two kinds of monsters. The first  type can be redeemed. And, more importantly,  they want to be redeemed…
BUFFY: And the second type?
GILES: The second - is void of humanity.  It can not respond to reason. Or love.
WILLOW: I thought Faith was on duty.
BUFFY: Change of plans.
WILLOW: Glazed or cake? It's fun to watch them  make them, you know. They have this  spritzy thing that plops the batter right-
BUFFY: (interrupting) You couldn't sleep either?
WILLOW: I've been sitting in Mr. Donut since the  TV did that snowy thing. (then) But, how come you're wakey-girl? I mean,  this time it's not your boyfriend who may  be a cold-blooded-
WILLOW: -jelly donut.
OZ: Everything okay?
BUFFY: Yeah - what happened with the inspection  of the body?
WILLOW: (re: donuts) Anybody? They're yummy delicious.
BUFFY: (anxious) Come on, Will. Was it a werewolf….. (quietly) Was it a vampire?
WILLOW: It wasn't conclusive. I-
BUFFY: How could you not conclude? I mean,  what did it look like? Was he bit?
GILES: (cutting her off) Let her finish, Buffy.
BUFFY: It's just…. Sorry.
WILLOW: I should know more after tonight.  I'm doing hair and fiber tests.
OZ: You know how to do those?
WILLOW: (caught) Not - I…like to sound technical when I'm scared.  But I figure - wolf hair, hair found on the body.  See if they match. It's a test.
OZ: So we're scared now. It's official.
WILLOW: What? Oh - no - I didn't mean it that way-
OZ: No. I'd say scared is pretty much called for. It's cool.
SCOTT: Can't back you on this lunch.  Nutritional demerits.
BUFFY: My stomach doesn't want hard food.  There's fruit stuff in there.
SCOTT: Those are marshmallows.
BUFFY: Oh….. (then) I'm kinda out of it today. Didn't sleep well.
DEBBIE: Just don't tell Mr. Platt you've got insomnia.  He'll make you start a "dream journal."
PETE: What's that - like a Barbie thing? "Dear  Dream Journal, why hasn't Ken come around  since he got that earring…?"
DEBBIE: I never did it. He's a quack.
BUFFY: I sort of thought he was cool.
DEBBIE: Really? (trying) I guess he can be funny and stuff.  It's just - I don't like the things he  says sometimes.
BUFFY: Yeah. He definitely marches to the beat  of his own drummer. In fact - I think  he makes his own drums.
SCOTT: My mom say therapy can be completely helpful-
PETE: Your Mom has the wattage of a Zippo lighter, Scott.
SCOTT: I hope you realize I don't actually know these  people. I just thought you'd like me better if  I had friends - so I hired them.
SCOTT: (then/quietly) So - I wanted to tell you that you look great  today. But now I want to raise that to amazing  because you didn't sleep well.
BUFFY: God. That's incredibly -
BUFFY: -sweet…. And I wish I didn't have to…  But I just remembered… that I do…  I'll see you.
PETE: Check out Scott. Liking the manic-depressive chick.
PETE: Kidding, my friend. She's special.  Like two very hot girlfriends in one.
BUFFY: Angel? Can you - ?
PETE: Come on - just for a minute…
DEBBIE: I can't. I have to meet a friend-
DEBBIE: No. Let - Let's stay here.
PETE: What's with you today? Relax…
PETE: What is that?
DEBBIE: Nothing. Kiss me.
PETE: You didn't drink that, did you?
DEBBIE: Drink it? You - you know I didn't.
PETE: Debbie… What's going on?
BUFFY: Two o'clock, Buffy right. Don't turn  around and don't say anything. Just  listen. That's your thing, right? (with difficulty) Something's going on… I mean, the  whole entire story will probably convince  you I'm like, loony bin material. But I  can't tell anybody - not Willow, not Giles,  nobody… They'd just freak out on me or  maybe do something… And I'm… I need help. (near tears) I need to talk to someone. I'm so  scared. I - this guy, he…
BUFFY: … he's come back…
PETE: So - the bottle jumped out of the  cabinet and spilled on its own?
DEBBIE: Of course not -
DEBBIE: I - I was just trying to get rid of it.
PETE: You were trying to get rid of it.
DEBBIE: To help you. You know how you get-
PETE: You think this has anything to  do with "how I get?"
DEBBIE: Well, when you drink it-
PETE: When I drink it - nothing! I don't  need it anymore, Debbie. I'm past that now-
PETE: See? No more! You can pour out  everything I made and it won't help -  and you want to know why?
PETE: You know why?! Because all it takes  is you now, Debbie. You and your  stupid, grating voice-
PETE: You're the reason I started with the  formulas in the first place - to be the  man you wanted. And you pay me  back, how? You whore around with  other guys and taunt-
DEBBIE: No! I don't! I don't even look-
PETE: I was talking! Is that something your  shrink taught you, Debbie - to "share?"  To "communicate?" To piss me off!?
PETE: Well, guess what? Even he's not going  to listen to your pathetic ramblings anymore-
PETE: I'm all you've got, Debbie.  You hear me!? I'm all you've got!
PETE: Ah, hell. God…
PETE: Baby, you okay?
PETE: You know you shouldn't make  me mad. You know what happens.  (off her silence) Please, Debbie. You alright?
DEBBIE: It's okay… It's okay…
GILES: This creature is especially brutal. I  think the charming phrase the coroner  used when describing Mr. Platt was  "pureed." But he did confirm that Platt  had been dead just a few hours when  Buffy found him.
FAITH: Which means the guy was killed during the day.
WILLOW: Yes!
WILLOW: Sorry. I got a little… I mean,  it's horrible. Horrible.
BUFFY: It's okay, Will. We're all glad  Oz is off the hook.
GILES: (concerned) Indeed. But shouldn't he be here  by now? The sun sets at half past five.
DEBBIE: Sorry I'm late. Did you bring the notes?
OZ: You okay?
DEBBIE: What? Oh, yeah. I'm such a klutz. I, uh…
OZ: Fell down and hit your… eye.
DEBBIE: Door knob.  (re: notes) Thanks.
OZ: Hey. If you want to talk-
DEBBIE: I - (thinks better of it) Thanks again for the notes.
GILES: Our task now is to determine what  sort of killer we're dealing with-
GILES: Clearly we're looking for a depraved,  sadistic animal.
OZ: Present.  (glances at Willow) Hey. I may be a cold blooded jelly  donut - but my timing's impeccable.
WILLOW: But you're not! It's a "kill in the day"  monster! One-hundred percent for sure.
OZ: Okay.
GILES: I wish we had time to celebrate properly.  Unfortunately, it's imperative that we  find out who or what is doing this. (then) Now. We have two victims. Jeff Walken,  and now Platt. Perhaps they have  something in common-
FAITH: Missing internal organs?
GILES: Besides that.
OZ: Debbie.
OZ: Victim #1. Jeff? He was in Jazz  band with us. They used to horse around.
FAITH: They were screwing?
OZ: I don't think so. But he hid her music  comp book once.
BUFFY: Good enough. And we know Debbie knew  Mr. Platt. She was seeing him and way vocal  about not having the love for the guy.
OZ: Add this and stir. I ran into her just  now - sporting a nasty black eye.
WILLOW: Okay. Pretend Debbie wanted Platt  dead. Maybe he fought back.
BUFFY: No, he was dead in an instant.  Didn't even lose his cigarette.
BUFFY: Could be - boyfriend Pete's the  one doling out the punishment.
GILES: We have to find them both immediately.
OZ: Deb was in the hall a minute ago.
GILES: We should split up. Faith - you and I  will team. Willow - you stick with Buffy.
OZ: I'll - lock myself in the cage.
BUFFY: It's tricky covering a fresh shiner like  that. You know what works?
DEBBIE: What?
BUFFY: Don't get hit.
BUFFY: What's going on, Debbie? I'd bet the farm you know.
DEBBIE: You're wrong. I don't know anything.
BUFFY: Now - normally? I'd say - you want to  play "I have a secret" - fine. But people are dying.
DEBBIE: It's - it's not his fault. I mean, he's not  himself when he gets like this…
BUFFY: You mean Pete.
DEBBIE: (nods) It's me. I make him crazy. He just  does what he does because he loves  me too much -
WILLOW: So it is him? But weren't Mr. Platt  and Jeff murdered by an animal?
BUFFY: Pete's… not like other guys, is he Debbie?
DEBBIE: I - I've got to go.
BUFFY: You have to talk to us. We can't  help you until you do.
DEBBIE: I didn't ask for your help.
WILLOW: Well, when are you going to? I  mean - if Pete kills you - it'll be  pretty much too late.
BUFFY: Debbie. We're running out of time.
BUFFY: Where can we find him, Debbie?
DEBBIE: (freaking) I - I don't know.
BUFFY: You're lying.
DEBBIE: What if I am. What are you going  to do about it?
WILLOW: (wincing) Wrong question.
BUFFY: Look at yourself. Why are you  protecting him?
BUFFY: Anybody who really loved you  couldn't do this to you.
DEBBIE: He's going to change. He promised -
BUFFY: Maybe. At best 50/50. Lame odds  when you're betting your life.
DEBBIE: (meekly) Would they take him someplace?
BUFFY: Probably.
DEBBIE: (rising panic) Be away from Pete? I can't -
WILLOW: Of course you can. And we'll both  help you. Believe me - we understand. (then) But you have to choose. It's got to be  you over him.
DEBBIE: I could never do that to him.  I'm his everything.
BUFFY: (losing patience) Great. While you guys enjoy your  grim fairy-tale, two people are dead.  Who's gonna be next?
PETE: Since when do you touch my girl?
OZ: This is a really bad time, Pete.
PETE: Guess you weren't thinking about that  when you put the moves on Debbie…
OZ: I talked to her, yeah. But it was move-free.
OZ: About this cage? When the sun sets -
PETE: You won't be alive to see it.
OZ: I'm serious. Something happens, which  you probably won't believe -
OZ: -or you might.
DEBBIE: He does love me. He does love me…
BUFFY: We'd better go - we have to find Pete.
DEBBIE: He does love me. He does love me…
WILLOW: (to Buffy/worried) I think we broke her.
BUFFY: (sadly) I think she was broken before this.
PETE: Did you kiss that whore? Did she like it?
OZ: Time's up. Rules change.
FAITH: What the hell - ?
DEBBIE: Pete! Watch out!
GILES: Right. Bloody priceless.
BUFFY: I'll take Pete.
FAITH: I got the wolf.
DEBBIE: Pete?
DEBBIE: Pete - you're alright. God, you're alright…
DEBBIE: She almost shot you - did you see? I stopped her.
DEBBIE: You have to leave. Get out of  Sunnydale. She knows -
PETE: How does she know, Debbie.  Did you run your big mouth?
DEBBIE: No! she just knew. I mean,  it seemed like she knew -
PETE: So you filled in the blanks.
DEBBIE: No -
PETE: But what did I expect from a  screw up like you?
DEBBIE: I - I didn't. Pete -
PETE: Fact is, Debbie? You're nothing  but a waste of space.
DEBBIE: No…
WILLOW: No! Down!! Bad Oz!
BUFFY: Oh my God.
FAITH: The gun! Where's the gun!?
WILLOW: Get off her!
WILLOW: Get the gun, get the gun,  get the gun!!
WILLOW: HURRY!
PETE: All the same! You're all the same!
WILLOW: We have to get you a better cage.
ANGEL: Buffy?
ANGEL: Buffy…
WILLOW: It's all over school. What happened  with Debbie and Pete… Except for  the "Pete was a monster" part.
OZ: Yeah. A freshman told me that Pete  had eight iced café mochas and lost it.
BUFFY: It's better than the estrogen theory.  I heard he took all his mother's  birth control pills.
CORDELIA: He didn't? Pete was a monster?  Where have I been?
XANDER: In your special place, Cor.  And that's why I adore you.
CORDELIA: So what's the true story? What happened?
WILLOW: Well, we found Pete's lab diaries and  stuff. Mr. Science was pulling a  Jeckel/Hyde deal. He was afraid Debbie  would leave him - so he mixed this  potion to get super mas macho.
BUFFY: Thing was, after a while, he didn't need  a potion to turn into the bad guy. He  got there on the natch.
CORDELIA: So it was like a real killing? He wasn't  under the influence of anything?
BUFFY: Just himself.
BUFFY: I'd better…
CORDELIA: Great. Now I'm going to be stuck  with serious thoughts all day.
BUFFY: I don't even know what to say  that won't sound stupid or obvious.
SCOTT: I've been friends with both of them  since before we started school…
BUFFY: If there's anything I can do -
SCOTT: Thanks. I'll be fine - or… (then) It's just… You never really know what's  going on inside somebody - do you? You  think if you care about them - you know.  But you never really do.
