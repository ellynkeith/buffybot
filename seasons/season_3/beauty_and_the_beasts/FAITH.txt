You ever catch kids doing the  horizontal two-step out here?
Yeah? Bet you and Scott been out there Kicking the old gearshift.
But you like him, right? When you think about Him you get that good, down low tickle?

All men are beasts, Buffy.
Not cynical. Realistic. Every guy - from  "Manimal" right on down to "Mr. I Loved the  English Patient" - has beast in him. And I don't  care how sensitive they act - they're still just in it for the chase…..
Buffy! Are you okay!? What are you doing here?
God, I'm sorry… I didn't hear you.
Get out of jail free, huh? How come?
Cool. I was going nuts in here. I bet I  can still get in a few good stakings before sunrise.
Later.
Which means the guy was killed during the day.
Missing internal organs?
They were screwing?
What the hell - ?
I got the wolf.
The gun! Where's the gun!?
