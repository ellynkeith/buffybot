Hey. (off her questioning look) That's what I stopped you for, basically. Hey.
Oh. We're not up to flowers.  (suddenly anxious) Are we? Up to flowers? Did I miss flowers?
Stable. Okay. Topics to avoid. The little men that live in your teeth…. Your compulsion to paint circus clowns….
You'll do great.
Yeah. Good.
Can't back you on this lunch.  Nutritional demerits.
Those are marshmallows.
My mom say therapy can be completely helpful-
I hope you realize I don't actually know these  people. I just thought you'd like me better if  I had friends - so I hired them.
(then/quietly) So - I wanted to tell you that you look great  today. But now I want to raise that to amazing  because you didn't sleep well.
I've been friends with both of them  since before we started school…
Thanks. I'll be fine - or… (then) It's just… You never really know what's  going on inside somebody - do you? You  think if you care about them - you know.  But you never really do.
