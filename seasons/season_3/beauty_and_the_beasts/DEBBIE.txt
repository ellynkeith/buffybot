Hi, Oz. Hey, you're not doing Jazz band this year?
Thanks. Pete brought them for me.
Platt? The school counselor?
Platt creeps me out. I would totally quit going, but I'm flunking senior bio and my teacher says I have "success issues."
Thanks. That'd be great.
Just don't tell Mr. Platt you've got insomnia.  He'll make you start a "dream journal."
I never did it. He's a quack.
Really? (trying) I guess he can be funny and stuff.  It's just - I don't like the things he  says sometimes.
I can't. I have to meet a friend-
No. Let - Let's stay here.
Nothing. Kiss me.
Drink it? You - you know I didn't.
Of course not -
I - I was just trying to get rid of it.
To help you. You know how you get-
Well, when you drink it-
No! I don't! I don't even look-
It's okay… It's okay…
Sorry I'm late. Did you bring the notes?
What? Oh, yeah. I'm such a klutz. I, uh…
Door knob.  (re: notes) Thanks.
I - (thinks better of it) Thanks again for the notes.
What?
You're wrong. I don't know anything.
It's - it's not his fault. I mean, he's not  himself when he gets like this…
(nods) It's me. I make him crazy. He just  does what he does because he loves  me too much -
I - I've got to go.
I didn't ask for your help.
(freaking) I - I don't know.
What if I am. What are you going  to do about it?
He's going to change. He promised -
(meekly) Would they take him someplace?
(rising panic) Be away from Pete? I can't -
I could never do that to him.  I'm his everything.
He does love me. He does love me…
He does love me. He does love me…
Pete! Watch out!
Pete?
Pete - you're alright. God, you're alright…
She almost shot you - did you see? I stopped her.
You have to leave. Get out of  Sunnydale. She knows -
No! she just knew. I mean,  it seemed like she knew -
No -
I - I didn't. Pete -
No…
