FAITH: (under her breath) Come on…
BUFFY: Now!
GILES: I think that's the last.
WILLOW: (Latin) Dissipate. Ut venistis, abite. Obscurate nos non diutius. (English) Dissipate. As you have come, be gone. Cloud us no longer.
BUFFY: Are you okay?
WILLOW: I'm fine. The shaking is a side effect of the fear.
BUFFY: Well, if it wasn't for your clouding spell-
WILLOW: It went good! Nothing melted like last time.
FAITH: These babes were wicked rowdy. What's their deal?
GILES: I wish I knew. I heard there was a  nest here, but quite frankly I was  expecting vampires. These are new.
BUFFY: And improved.
GILES: Well, I'm sorry. I should have had  you better prepared, and I should  never have allowed Willow and… and…
XANDER: I'm good. We're fine over here. Little bit dirty. (dusts himself off) Good show, everyone. Just great. I think we have a hit.
WILLOW: Are you okay?
XANDER: Tip top. Really. If anyone sees my spine lying around, just try not to step on it.
BUFFY: Xander, one of these days you're  gonna get yourself hurt.
FAITH: Or killed.
BUFFY: Or both. You know, with pain and then  the death. You shouldn't be leaping into  the fray like that. You should be fray-adjacent.
XANDER: Excuse me: who, at the crucial moment, distracted the lead demon by allowing her to pummel him about the head?
FAITH: Yeah, that was pretty manly the way  you shrieked and all.
XANDER: I think you'll find that was more of a bellow.
BUFFY: (re: demons) So what do we do about the Heroic trio here? Should we burn the bodies?
WILLOW: I brought marshmallows! (off their looks) Occasionally I am callous and strange.
GILES: I expect we can leave them. I'm more interested in finding out what they are, and if we can expect any more of their kind.
BUFFY: I hope not. These guys are way too fit.
XANDER: I say bring 'em on.
XANDER: But gee, Mr. White, if Clark and Lois  get all the big stories I'll never be a  real reporter. (off his look) Jimmy Olsen jokes are pretty much  gonna be lost on you.
GILES: Sorry.
XANDER: It's okay.
XANDER: Hey! Bobby! Toss me one. (doesn't work) Les, man, I'm open. (still ignored) Let's go Bobby!
JACK: What are you, retarded?
XANDER: No! I mean I had to do that test when  I was seven, a little slow in some stuff,  mostly math and spatial relations, but  certainly not "challenged" or anything, can I buy you another soda?
JACK: I ought to cut your face open.
XANDER: (bridles) Hey! It was an accident, okay? Cool down.
JACK: (gets in his face) You wanna be starting something?
XANDER: (completely folding) What? Starting - like that Michael Jackson song, that was a lot of fun… "too high to get over - yeah yeah." Remember… that fun song…
JACK: I get my buddies together, we're gonna kick you're ass till it's a brand new shape. Now get out of here.
CORDELIA: Boy, of all the humiliations of yours I've witnessed, that was the latest.
XANDER: I coulda taken him.
CORDELIA: Oh, please. O'Toole would macramé your face. He's a psycho. Which is still cooler than being a wuss…
XANDER: Why is it that I've come face to face  with vampires, demons, the most  hideous creatures hell ever spit up,  and I'm still afraid of a little bully  like Jack O'Toole?
CORDELIA: Because unlike all those other creatures  you came face to face with… Jack  actually noticed you were there.
XANDER: Why am I not surprised by how comforting you're not?
CORDELIA: It must be hard when all your friends have, like, superpowers. Slayers and werewolves and witches and vampires and you're like this little nothing. You must feel like… like Jimmy Olsen.
XANDER: (laughing) I was just saying to - (whining) Hey! Mind your own business.
CORDELIA: Ohh, hit a nerve. The Boy Who Had No Cool.
XANDER: I happen to be an integral part of the group and I happen to have a lot to offer.
CORDELIA: Oh, please.
XANDER: I do!
CORDELIA: Integral part of the group. Xander. You're the useless part of the group. You're the Zeppo.
XANDER: But I mean, what is it? How do you get it? Who doesn't have it? And who decides who doesn't have it? What is the essence of cool?
OZ: Not sure.
XANDER: I mean you yourself, Oz, are considered  more or less cool. Why is that?
OZ: Am I?
XANDER: Is it about the talking? You know, the way you tend to express yourself in short, noncommittal phrases?
OZ: Could be.
XANDER: No. No. It's the guitar thing. You're in a band, that's like a business class ticket to cool with complimentary mojo after takeoff. I should play an instrument. Is it hard to play guitar?
OZ: Not the way I play it.
XANDER: Okay but on the other hand, eighth grade I'm taking flugelhorn and getting <u>zero</u> trim, so the instrument thing could be a mislead. But you need a thing. One thing nobody else has. What do I have?
OZ: An exciting new obsession - which I feel makes you very special.
XANDER: And now the mocking, which I can handle because I'm right about this, I'm on the track. Need to find my thing.
OZ: Just kinda feel you're overthinking it. You've got some identity issues, it's not-
GILES: The end of the world.
BUFFY: Can they do it?
GILES: They seem very committed to it. The Sisterhood of Jhe is an apocalypse cult, they exist solely to bring about world destruction. And we've not seen the last of them. More will follow.
BUFFY: And they're in Sunnydale for what? Demon Expo?
GILES: Buffy, this is no laughing matter.
BUFFY: Hence my no laughing.
OZ: Hey.
BUFFY: Hey.
GILES: Ah yes. Cutting it a bit close.
OZ: You know me.
BUFFY: (to Giles) Well, do we know why they're here?
GILES: I think so. Based on the artifacts I found  with them, and taking into account the  current astral cycle -
BUFFY: Giles, I don't need to see the math.
GILES: They intend to open the Hellmouth.
BUFFY: The Hellmouth. The one that opens -
GILES: About twenty feet from where  you're standing.
WILLOW: And if it opens?
BUFFY: Remember that demon that almost got out the night I died?
WILLOW: Every nightmare I have that doesn't revolve around academic failure or  public nudity is about that thing. In  fact, one time I dreamed that it attacked  me while I was late for a test and naked.
BUFFY: It'll be the first to come out. And it  won't be the worst by a long shot.  The world will be overrun with demons  unless we stop it.
WILLOW: Do we know when this is supposed  to happen?
BUFFY: Giles is trying to narrow it down. If  you're up for it, we're headed into  deep research mode.
WILLOW: I'll be offended if you haven't already counted me in.
BUFFY: Thanks. There's something about this one… it scares me. I need my Willow with me.
WILLOW: You don't have to be afraid.
XANDER: You girls need a lift?
BUFFY: What is that?
XANDER: What do you mean, what is it? It's my thing!
WILLOW: Your thing?
XANDER: (slowly, "don't you get it?") My thing…
BUFFY: (cringing slightly) Is this a penis metaphor?
XANDER: My thing that makes me cool! You know, that makes me unique. I'm car guy. Guy with a car.
WILLOW: How could you afford it?
XANDER: Uncle Roary stacking up the DUI's, letting me rent this bad boy till he's mobile again.
BUFFY: (mind elsewhere) Well, it's nice.
XANDER: If you could sound less enthused…
BUFFY: Sorry.
WILLOW: Evil.
XANDER: Big?
BUFFY: Biggest. Maybe more than I can handle.
XANDER: Then we'll handle it together. You know I'm here for you. Just tell me what I can do.
XANDER: Two of the glazed, two cinnamon, couple of those crème-filled, and a jelly. Let's round that out to four jellies.
CORDELIA: Ooh, some evil going on? It must be big for them to entrust you with this daredevil mission.
XANDER: Cordelia, feel free to die of a wasting  disease in the next twenty seconds.
CORDELIA: Again I strike the nerve. I am a surgeon of mean.
XANDER: I'm busy right now, okay?
CORDELIA: Right, Buffy needs your help. Can you say 'expendable'?
XANDER: You think you know everything -
CORDELIA: I think I know you.
XANDER: That's a laugh.
CORDELIA: Oh, what, you got a shiny car and now  you're someone new. Like anyone  cares about -
LYSETTE: (to Xander) Is that your car?
XANDER: Why, yes, it is.
LYSETTE: '57 Chevy Bel Aire, 283 C.I.D solid lifter, fuel injected v8?
XANDER: Uh… very possibly.
LYSETTE: How does she handle?
XANDER: Like a dream about warm sticky things.  You wanna go for a little drive?
LYSETTE: You busy?
XANDER: Well, I have to drop these off, and then  I'd describe myself as 'expendable'.
LYSETTE: And then, you know, I started seeing  Dave Peck; he had a Thunderbird, engine  completely tricked out, but the upholstery  was like shot, and then I was with his friend Mike, not the Mike with the Mercedes, the Mike with the Mustang, an 82, v6, you know the look…
XANDER: Angel! Buddy. Friend buddy.  Do you want to stay and talk?
ANGEL: I'm looking for Buffy.
XANDER: Library, last I saw.
ANGEL: Something's happening. I've seen portents -
XANDER: Apocalypse. They're on top of it.
ANGEL: I don't think they know what they're dealing with.
XANDER: Well, let's go! And tell them that.
ANGEL: No, you'd best stay out of harm's way.
XANDER: But I could help…
LYSETTE: You wanna go for another drive?
XANDER: It's not like I haven't helped before. (starting her up) I've done quality violence for those people, do they even think of that? They act like I'm some klutz --
LYSETTE: That's gonna trash your hood.
XANDER: All right. Oh god. Stay calm. Little fender bender, it's not --
XANDER: … the end of the world.
XANDER: Oh. Gosh. Jack. Hey, are you okay? I'm really sorry about that. Your car came out of nowhere.
JACK: I was parked.
XANDER: Exactly. Okay, I can cover the damages.  I don't have insurance in the strictest  sense of the word, but I have a little  money… The important thing is that  we're okay, and we can work this out  like two reasonable -
JACK: Where do you want it?
XANDE: What?
JACK: Where do you want it?
XANDER: I'm fairly certain that I don't want it. But thank you!
LYSETTE: Wow, cool knife.
XANDER: Yeah, great knife… although I think (indicating length) it may be technically a sword…
JACK: She's called Katie.
XANDER: You gave it a girl's name! How very serial killer of you. Lysette, I think we should go.
JACK: You scared?
XANDER: Would that make you happy?
JACK: Your woman's looking on and you can't stand up to me? Don't you feel pathetic?
XANDER: Mostly I feel Katie.
JACK: You know what the difference between you and me is?
XANDER: Again, Katie springing to mind.
JACK: Fear. Who has the least fear.
XANDER: And nothing to do with who has the  big sharp --
JACK: Come on.
LYSETTE: I wanna go for a drive. I'm bored.
XANDER: Well I'm sorry my life or death struggle isn't exciting enough --
COP: What's going on?
JACK: Nothing. Just rasslin'.
COP: O'Toole. What a surprise. (to Xander) He attack you?
XANDER: No. Just letting off steam. Two guys rasslin'. But not in a gay way.
XANDER: What.
JACK: That was all right.
XANDER: (a little worried) Yay?
JACK: Hey, you two wanna have some fun?
LYSETTE: Like, with driving?
JACK: Yeah.
XANDER: What did you have in mind?
JACK: I was on my way to get the boys together. Gonna cruise around. We'll take your wheels.
XANDER: Well, what about your car?
JACK: Ain't mine.
XANDER: Okay, where to?
JACK: Get my buddies!
XANDER: Yeah. Great. Where are your buddies?
JACK: He calls forth, the spirit of Uurthu,  the restless, no one shall sleep. He shall arise… hear, me, the blood of the Earth shall restore him --
BOB: Buddy!
JACK: Bob, you hideous corpse, come here!
XANDER: I'll call you…
BOB: (to Jack) Man, You raised me!
JACK: I told you my grandpappy could work  that mojo. And Big Bob is back in action.
BOB: Yes!
XANDER: Maybe I should leave you two to  catch up --
JACK: Bob, this is Xander. He's our wheel man.
BOB: Hey,
XANDER: Howdy.
BOB: Dude, where are the other guys?  We gotta go get 'em!
JACK: Absolutely.
XANDER: Are they, um… are all your friends dead?
JACK: Xander. Let's roll.
BOB: How long I been down?
JACK: Eight months! Hadda wait for the stars to align.
BOB: Eight months! Man. I got some catching up to do. (turning to Jack) You been taping Walker Texas Ranger?
JACK: Every ep.
BOB: Thank god. We'll get the guys together, we'll parTAY. This is gonna be a night to remember.
XANDER: (to himself) I'm sensing that.
GILES: (Latin) Noli me renuere,umbra ducens! Sapientia manium super me effundatur! (English) Do no deny me, spirit guide! Let the wisdom of those who have passed be showered upon me!  VOICE FROM EVERYWHERE (Latin) Illae res occultae sunt tempori et locis obscuris! Nmeo mortalis conscius doctrinae peritae sit. Enuntiare illas Chaos super  orbem vivum terrarum ferat! (English) These secrets belong to time and the dark regions! No mortal shall be privy to the lost knowledge. To reveal them would bring Chaos down upon the living Earth!  GILES (Latin) Belua propulsanda est. Invenire vitium suum nostar spes sola est! (English) The beast must be fought. Our only hope lies in finding its weakness!
EVERYWHERE: (Latin) Noli petere! Perturba nos non diutius… (English) Seek not! Disturb us no longer...
XANDER: Giles. Hey, what's going on?
GILES: Trying to gain access to the spirit guides - not going very well, I'm afraid. What are you doing here?
XANDER: Oh, we've just been raising… some heck.
JACK: Xander! Let's go!
XANDER: Listen, if you guys need help --
GILES: Thank you, but the best thing you can do right now is to keep yourself out of trouble.
XANDER: Not much chance of that…
JACK: Xander! Motor!
GILES: There's something different about this menace. In the air, I can feel it. The stench of death.
XANDER: I think that's Bob.
GILES: (hand on Xander's shoulder) We may all be called upon to fight when it happens.
XANDER: When what happens, exactly?
JACK: Come on!
GILES: I'd best go. Hopefully, there will be time to prepare. All we need is a few weeks.
BUFFY: Tonight?
WILLY: Before sunrise… that's what they said…
BUFFY: Why did they do this?
WILLY: They were looking… for Angel.
BUFFY: Angel… Why?
WILLY: Said they were coming after you too. Said nothing could stand in their way because tonight was -- (twinge of pain) Ahh!
BUFFY: The ambulance is coming.
WILLY: Kid, my clientele ain't exactly nuns and orphans. But I never seen anything like these demons.
BUFFY: I'm gonna stop them.
WILLY: That Hellmouth opens, they're gonna be the least of your problems, is my train of thought.
BOB: Let's get some beers!
DICKIE: I wanna bake a cake.
BOB: We gotta have beers, though!
PARKER: (to Bob) Man, I can't believe you got shot! Was it the Jackals?
JACK: Are you kidding? We wiped them out after they threw you off the bridge.
PARKER: Really? You guys are the best. I mean it.
BOB: Liquor store. Little Armenian guy, runs  the place, he had a gun behind the  counter. Hey, we should go kick his ass!
XANDER: If you guys want me to drop you somewhere…
JACK: No. You're with us now.
PARKER: Yeah, man, you're on the team! Yes!
BOB: What are we gonna do?
JACK: I've heard a lot of interesting  suggestions, but I'm gonna go  with Dickie's. Let's bake a cake.
DICKIE: Yes! Gonna do it! Gonna do it!
JACK: You stay here. And keep the motor running.
XANDER: This time of night, I'm pretty sure nothing's open --
WILLOW: Thank you! Sorry to wake you!
XANDER: Will!
WILLOW: Xander! What are you doing here?
XANDER: Nothing! Certainly not crime… What about you?
WILLOW: I needed supplies for a protection spell. Buffy called from Angel's: It's happening tonight
XANDER: And the thing that's happening would be…?
WILLOW: I can't stay. Buffy'll need this stuff.
XANDER: Okay, that's it, I'm going to --
JACK: Where you going?
XANDER: Look, something's come up.
JACK: You wanna bail on me? Is that it?
DICKIE: We got the cake mix!
PARKER: Where do you wanna bake it?
JACK: Xander's looking to take off.
JACK: Xander doesn't feel he's part of the group.
XANDER: No, I'm just kind of busy…
BOB: Of course he doesn't feel like part of  the group. He hasn't been initiated!
DICKIE: Yeah! Yeah!
JACK: Do you think he's ready?
PARKER: He's earned his stripes. I say we take him in.
XANDER: (wimping out) Great… I wanna be in the gang, sure.
JACK: That's the spirit.
XANDER: What do I gotta do?
XANDER: Now guys… let's really talk about this.
PARKER: You wanna be in the gang, don't you?
XANDER: Yes, but I'm not dying to be in the gang… if you get the… the pun there…
BOB: What, are you too good to be dead? You got something against dead people?
XANDER: Well, now, what about Jack? Jack isn't dead.
JACK: Three weeks ago. Drive by.
XANDER: Oh boy.
JACK: Grandpappy found my body. I wasn't gone ten minutes before he raised me. It's a rush, man.
DICKIE: Let's kill Xander! It'll be fun!
PARKER: You'll be a full fledged member.
JACK: Come on, Xander. Take it like a man.
XANDER: All right, enough!
JACK: Get him!
BOB: Damn! There goes our wheels.
PARKER: And he got our stuff.
DICKIE: I wanna bake a cake!
JACK: It's all right. We'll get more (looking out where Xander went) The night is still young.
XANDER: I'd say that's pretty much enough excitement for one evening.
XANDER: Get in!
XANDER: You think Hell Mama followed us?
FAITH: Naw, we're cool. The bitch dislocated my shoulder, though. Hold me.
XANDER: (the intimacy making him nervous) Really? Pop?
FAITH: You up for it?
XANDER: Oh, I'm up. I'm suddenly very up.
FAITH: Relax. And take off your pants.
XANDER: Those two concepts are antithetical.
FAITH: Don't worry, I'll steer you 'round the curves.
XANDER: Did I mention that I'm having a very strange night?
XANDER: My God… Faith…
FAITH: That was great. I gotta shower.
XANDER: Hey…
XANDER: Long gone. Probably loaded with supplies. Gotta think. (beat) I can't believe I had sex! (thinks some more) Okay, bombs. Already dead guys with bombs. Oh, man, I'm out of my league.
BUFFY: (in tears) I don't know what to do!
ANGEL: Then let me decide for you. I can  face this thing --
BUFFY: You can't!
ANGEL: I can at least buy you enough time  for Willow's spell to bind it. Buffy,  this is worse than anything we've  ever faced. It's the only way.
BUFFY: I can't watch you die again!
ANGEL: I love you.
BUFFY: I love you…
ANGEL: Nothing can change that. Not even death.
BUFFY: Don't talk like that to me. You may be ready to go but I'm not ready to lose you. This is my fight and if you won't do it my way --
XANDER: Sorry, I- There's this- I'm not a hundred percent sure, but… It seems like you two have bigger things- (then) Never mind.
GILES: (Latin) Terra, vente, ignis et pluvia. Cuncta quattuor numina, vos obsecro. Defendite nos a recente Malo resoluto- (English) Earth, wind, fire and rain. All four powers I beseech you. Protect us from fresh evil unleashed-
WILLOW: Okay. Oz is moved. He could barely  walk after that mickey I gave him,  but we made it. (then/worried) You think he'll be okay there?
GILES: Anywhere is safer than here. (then) Help me with the candles.
WILLOW: We're doing the binding spell from Hebron's Almanac?
GILES: Yes, but once it's ready, you're to stay back and let me do the final recitation (she starts to --) Don't argue with me. I want you safe. (looking to where the opening will be) Who knows what's going to come up  from beneath us.
JACK: (grins) This is gonna be large.
XANDER: Giles'll know what to do. He's way  more calm than Buffy.
BOB: Hey… Our wheels!
PARKER: Stop! Come on, stop, man!
XANDER: Where's the bomb?
PARKER: In the high school!
XANDER: In the school where?
PARKER: This really hurts! Boiler room!
XANDER: (slowly, tough guy) All right. Now I'm gonna ask this once, and you better pray you get the answer right. How do I defuse--
DICKIE: School! He's heading for the school!
JACK: That's it. No way am I bringing him back after I kill him.
JACK: There he is!
XANDER: Where's a slayer when you need one?
GILES: My god… it's grown…
DICKIE: Wow.
BOB: Which way?
JACK: He couldn't have gotten far. Let's split up.
BOB: Good for chopping.
BOB: Now this is my idea of fun!
XANDER: Shoulda learned by now. If you're gonna play with fire, you got to expect that sooner or later -
BUFFY: The heart, Faith! Go for its heart!
XANDER: Okay. Boiler room.
XANDER: Hello, nasty…
JACK: Just got harder
XANDER: I'm not leaving here until that thing is disarmed.
JACK: Then I guess you're not leaving.
JACK: I'm gonna carve you up and serve you with gravy. You piss me off, boy, you pay the price. First the eyes, then the  tongue, then I'll break every one of  your fingers --
XANDER: You gonna do all that in thirty eight seconds?
JACK: You'll die too.
XANDER: Yeah, looks like. So I guess the question really is… who has less fear?
JACK: I ain't afraid to die. I'm dead.
XANDER: Yeah, but this is different. Blowed up isn't walking around and drinking with your buddies dead. It's 'little bits swept up by the janitor' dead, and I don't think you're ready for that.
JACK: Are you?
XANDER: (smiling calmly) I like the quiet.
XANDER: Good boy.
JACK: I'm not going anywhere, Harris. And the first time you turn your back --
OZ: But Angel's gonna be okay?
BUFFY: (nods) He was only out for a few minutes. Longest of my life.
WILLOW: I'll never forget that thing's face. Its real face, I mean.
BUFFY: (to Giles) I don't know how you managed to… That was the bravest thing I've ever seen.
GILES: The stupidest. But the world continues to turn.
WILLOW: And no one's ever gonna know how close it came to stopping. Never know what we did.
XANDER: Guys.
WILLOW: Xander. Boy, you're lucky you weren't at school last night. It was crazed.
XANDER: Well, give me the quiet life. I'm gonna grab a snack. Anyone want? (heads shake) Oz?
OZ: (puzzled) I'm oddly full today.
XANDER: 'kay.
CORDELIA: Oh look, it's mister excitement. On another life or death donut mission? Or are we cruising for bimbos again. Giving them lessons in lack of cool…
