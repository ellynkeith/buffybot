I'm fine. The shaking is a side effect of the fear.
It went good! Nothing melted like last time.

I brought marshmallows! (off their looks) Occasionally I am callous and strange.
And if it opens?
Every nightmare I have that doesn't revolve around academic failure or  public nudity is about that thing. In  fact, one time I dreamed that it attacked  me while I was late for a test and naked.
Do we know when this is supposed  to happen?
I'll be offended if you haven't already counted me in.
You don't have to be afraid.

Thank you! Sorry to wake you!
Xander! What are you doing here?
I needed supplies for a protection spell. Buffy called from Angel's: It's happening tonight
I can't stay. Buffy'll need this stuff.
Okay. Oz is moved. He could barely  walk after that mickey I gave him,  but we made it. (then/worried) You think he'll be okay there?

I'll never forget that thing's face. Its real face, I mean.
And no one's ever gonna know how close it came to stopping. Never know what we did.
Xander. Boy, you're lucky you weren't at school last night. It was crazed.
