(interest piqued) What's this? A demon?
I'd be delighted to. However - the day of the Mayor's Ascension is rapidly approaching and we don't know what to expect.
On the contrary. We know Ascension refers to a human transforming  into a demon. Becoming the living  embodiment of an immortal.  Graduation day, our Mayor Wilkins  is scheduled to do just that.
There are thousands of species.
(first he's heard) You - ? Excuse me?
Fine. You're all suffering from a touch of Spring Madness, if you  ask me.
And I of course will be wearing pink taffeta as the chenille does nothing for my complexion and can we PLEASE talk about the Ascension?
And you say the beast just - stopped?
I know it's horrible, Buffy. But you'll  be hunting this creature - you should  study it.
Yes. Particularly vicious foe. It's a  type of demon foot soldier, bred  during the Mahkash wars. Trained  solely to kill, they feed on the brains  of their foes -
So. We have a threat against the  students on "their big night..."  A hell hound - (realization dawning) trained to attack people n formal wear.

Angel's not taking you, is he?
(genuine) I'm sorry, Buffy. (off her pained silence) I don't really know what to say.  It's my understanding that this is  the sort of thing that requires  ice cream of some kind.
You're sure?
Yes. Being at an all-male preparatory,  we didn't go in for this sort of thing.
For God's sake man. She's eighteen  and you have the emotional maturity  of a blueberry scone. Have at it, would  you, and stop fluttering about.
You did good work tonight, Buffy.
Yes. I really had no idea that children -  en masse -- could be gracious
Every now and then.
