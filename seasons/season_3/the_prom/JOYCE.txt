I'm sorry to... I would have called but I don't have your number.
My goodness. Your place is amazing.
No. You wouldn't.
No thank you, I - you don't drink? Beverages, I mean.
Oh. Well...
I understand Buffy spent the night.
(cutting him off)  I'm not interested in the details. That's not why I'm here.
I'm here because I'm worried about you two. In general.
It better not. But that's not all I'm concerned about. I mean, I don't have to tell you that you and Buffy come from different worlds.
And Buffy's had to deal with a lot. Grow up fast. Sometimes even I forget that she's still just a girl.
She's just starting out in life.
Good. Because when it comes to you, Angel - Buffy's not a slayer. She's just like any other young woman in love. You're all she can see of tomorrow. But I think we both know there's gonna be some hard choices ahead. If she can't make them, you're going to have to.
I know you care about her. I just hope you care enough.
