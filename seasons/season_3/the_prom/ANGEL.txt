Or something.
Where are you going?
No mirrors.
I think you look perfect.
That's right.
Right.
I guess maybe you should get home.
Ms. Summers.
Please. You're always welcome here.
Yeah. I like a lot of space. I don't get out much in the day.
Can I get you something? I don't have any coffee or I'd...
I'm sorry about that. We came back after patrolling and-
(a little wary) Okay.
I understand. And I promise you, what happened before? When I changed? It won't happen again.
No. You don't.
And I'm old enough to be her ancestor.
(gravely) I know. Believe me. I think about it. More now that she's staying in Sunnydale.
I'm sure I saw him come down here.
What can I say? I need closure.
Since when did patrolling go  black tie?
We have more important things  to think about right now than a  dance, Buffy.
Come on. Don't be that way-
I'm sorry. I'm just worried that  you're getting too... invested in  this whole thing.
I know.
It's... Nothing.
I think we need to talk. But not  here. Not now.
I need some time. I'm not even sure.
I've been thinking. About our future.  And the more I do, the more I feel  like us - you and me being together -  is unfair to you.
He was right.
You deserve more. You deserve  something outside of... demons  and darkness. You should have  someone who can take you into  the light. Someone who can make  love to you-
You will. And children-
Today. But you have no idea how  fast it goes, Buffy. Before you know  it, you'll want it all - a normal life.
Right. You'll always be a slayer.  But that's all the more reason why  you should have a real relationship  instead of this... this freak show.
I didn't mean it that way-
I'm sorry. Buffy, you know how  much I love you. It kills me to say this-
Have you? Rationally?
I'm trying to do what's right here -  I'm trying to think with my head  instead of my heart --
(stung) Buffy, please don't.
I don't.
It doesn't mean I don't --
I'm leaving. After the Ascension,  after it's finished with the Mayor  and Faith. If we survive, I'll go.
I don't know.
Buffy...
What are you doing here?
Sorry. It's just - I'm surprised.
How are you?
If it means anything, I miss you-
You're still planning to go?
Let me help you.
You know I'll always help you whenever --
It's a big night. I didn't want to miss it.  (beat) It's just tonight. It doesn't mean that--
Will you dance with me?
