What? Do I have funny bed  hair or something?
Guess we got carried away with the post-slayage nap thing.
Oooh. Not good.
To kill the cat on my head.
You know. This place is not girl friendly. No mirrors. No natural light.
Perfect? Come on. I mean, that's really- (happily)  Okay.
Still, we could think about getting a couple of mirrors in here. And maybe a drawer, for stuff of mine. I mean, that's what couples do, they have drawers.
'Cause I figure sometimes I could spend the night. After the prom, it'd be great to come back here and just be together...
Yeah. You know, the big "end-of-high-school-rite- of-passage" thingy? (off his silence) Imagine a cotillion with spiked punch and the electric slide.
Don't worry, it's at night. And lots of girls have older boyfriends. You'll blend.
(rising)  Ah, there's gotta be a few hours before sunrise --
I guess it's later than we thought.
At least now we've all got someone to go with. Some us are going with Demons, but that's a valid lifestyle choice. More importantly, I've got the kick dress.
Oh yeah. Angel's gonna lose it. (sudden worry) But not his soul. I mean, lose "it." His "it".
(to Willow) So - what? It was blue and sort of short?
A prom dress. That Will was thinking about buying. Can't you ever get your mind out of the Hellmouth?
We'll find you a dress, Will. We should check out April Fools.
Giles. We got it. Miles to go before we sleep. But, especially if we're going to vaporize or something on graduation day? We should be able to have a little prom-y fun. One night of glory; not too much to ask.
Angel?
Oh Goody. I always say patrol's  not complete without a trip to  the sticky sewers.
Can't we let this be the vamp  that got away? (making a "big fish" gesture) We can tell everybody he was  thiiiis big.
And clothes. You don't have a  tux, do you?
For the prom, silly.
Oh. Sorry, <u>Giles</u>. I'll just be quiet.
(to vamp/ irritated) Not now.
I'm not being that way. I say 'prom'  and you turn all grouchy.
In what "whole thing?" This is the  stuff I'm supposed to get invested in.  Going to a formal. Graduating.  Growing up.
Then what? What's with the dire?
No. You have a something face.
No. If you have something to  say - then just say it.
About what? You'd better cut  the cryptic, Angel. You're scaring me.
Is this about what the Mayor said?  He was just trying to shake us up.
Oh, come on! He's the bad guy!  We both know that...
(cutting him off) I don't care about that.
Children? Can you say jumping  the gun? I kill my goldfish.
I'll never have a normal life.
I - I'm gonna go-
(exploding) Then don't! who are you to tell me  what's right for me!? You think I've  never thought about this stuff?
No, I'm just a swoony little  schoolgirl, right?
What heart?
You have a heart? It isn't even beating!
Don't what? Don't love you?  I'm sorry, nobody told me I had  a choice! I can't just change -  I'll never change. I want my life  to be with you.
(Devastated) Don't - want to be with me?
I can't believe you're breaking up  with me...
How am I supposed to stay away  from you?
Where?
Angel?
(so lost)  Is this really happening?
That's it. Assuming we survive this  Ascension thing. He's leaving.
That's not his fault. He's 243 years  old. He doesn't get the prom.
Will. It's okay. You don't have to make him the bad guy.
Usually yeah. (with difficulty) But he's right. In the long run - I  think maybe he's right.
(smiling weakly) Oh. I think "horrible" is still coming.  Right now it's...worse.
Right now - I'm just trying to keep  from dying.
I can't breathe, Will. I feel like  I can't breathe.
I... I don't want to see it again.
I think I got it.
Fine.
Thanks.
Don't you dare.
No. You guys are gonna have a prom.  The kind of prom everyone should  have. I will give you all a nice, fun,  normal evening... if I have to kill  every single person on the face of  the Earth to do it.
Wes, go to his house. Probably not  there, but it's worth a shot.
(preemptively) You can take Cordy.
Oz - you said you know this David  kid Tucker e-mailed. You and Will  go track him down. Find out what  he knows - if he's involved.
Maybe you guys should stop by  the Magick shop too.
Ask if anybody's been in buying  supplies to raise a Hell Hound.
Giles, you said they eat brains.  Any brains?
Well, Tucker's gotta be feeding  that thing, right?
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Hello to you too.
Me too. Even though I shouldn't be.  I mean - where did I think you got  your blood? McPlasma's?
(tightly) Right as rain. Whatever that means.
Don't give me that look . I can lie  to you if I want to now. We're "ex"  - remember?
Could we - not? Truth is, when I  think about us I have a tendency  to go sort of catatonic. And I can't  do that right now. I've got to stop  a crazy person from pulling a  "Carrie" at the prom.
Strictly in the chaperone capacity.
It's cool. I'm fine with showing  up stag. I'm over the whole "Buffy  gets a perfect high-school moment" thing. (firmly) But no way am I going to let some  subhuman rob the entire senior class  of theirs.
No. I'm okay.
I'm okay. (softer) Thanks.
Make not with the long faces.  I got the address. (then) Now. The prom starts in a little  while. You guys go on. I'll catch  up with you as soon as I put a lid  on this jerk.
(interrupting/to others) To see tail lights. Hit the door.  I've got everything under control.
(deadly) Have. A. Nice. Time.
I want you at the gym. Keep an  eye on them till I get there.
Look. It's done. You want to run  after them and tell tem that they  can't go? You want to tell them  that all their planning and dreaming  was for nothing? That they can't be  with their honeys on tonight of  all nights?
He's leaving me. Leaving town.
The ice cream will come. First I  feel like taking out psycho boy.
Great thing about being a slayer.  Kicking ass is comfort food.
Sorry. New plan. The prom is go  and you're pathetic.
So that's it? You brain-washed the  hound to go psycho over all things prom?
I don't get. What kind of sicko  would want to destroy the happiest  night of a senior's life?
Whatever. Every maladjust has a  reason. Lucky for me you're an  incompetent maladjust.
Now. I'm just going to lock you  up in here - and then I'm going to  party like it's -
That's right, follow Buffy... good dogs...
Oh - come on! That song sucks!
Get back!
(gently stopping him) You're welcome.
Coolest. Devil dogs are history.  How's the prom?
Yeah, and I got a toy surprise.
Every now and then, people surprise you.
I never thought you'd come.
I know. I mean... I understand.
