Are you guys crazy? It was an incredible  game! I've never cheered so hard in my  life. I've still got knee-marks on my back. (off their looks) From the pyramid.
I don't see what this has to do with me.
Okay, who are you talking to? Because  you are just so creepy right now.
Whatever. Can I go?
I told them not to move you. They  probably severed your spinal cord.
(sarcastically) Yeah, 'cause that never happens in  American high schools.
I think I should work with Wesley.
Oh, like shame is something to  be proud of.
Hi, Mr. Beach. I was just wondering  if you were planning on killing a bunch  of people tomorrow? Oh, it's for the  yearbook.
The newspaper guy? But we can't  figure out it's him without the worksheet,  right?
Does he mention the cheerleaders?  Because we were <u>on</u>.
Oh, we have no shot. The killer could  be anyone. We lose.
(reading) "By this time tomorrow, you'll all know  what I've done."
"...I'm sure you understand that I had  to do it, and that although death is never  easy, it is the only way."
God, doesn't anyone write in to praise  the cheerleaders? We are so unsung.
