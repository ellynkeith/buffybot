Scabby Demon got away?
I don't like this "no mouth" thing.  It's disquieting. (realizing) Unless they have them somewhere  else...
Have you talked to Angel lately?
He only smootched her for the  greater good.
As always, I advise you to ask.
Hi.
Okay. Did you do the reading?
Percy...
That's my little trooper.
Wouldn't miss it.
I didn't either. But I've really been  getting into it, and now we're in the  championship and it's so exciting!  It's too bad you're patrolling 'cause  we're all going, Xander and Oz.  Everybody.
Well, according to Freddy's latest  editorial the pep rally is a place for  "pseudo-prostitutes to provoke men  into a sexual frenzy, which, when  thwarted, results in pointless athletic  competition".
The school paper is edging towards  depressing lately. Have you guys  noticed that?
Buffy? What are you doing?
Oh, Buffy. You know, I don't even  think Giles is right about you becoming  like a demon. He's totally burnt,  dealing with Faith and this  Ascension thing. Between you  and me, he's not doing his best work.
Was it a boy demon?
Yay! Whoo-hoo! (then) Sorry. They spelled Percy. I had to  show support. He's needy. But I heard  you. Really. And I understand. I would  be frightened too. But--
Okay.
It's gonna be fun. (off Buffy) If you like that sort of thing.
Could you believe it? Right at the buzzer! Three points for the win!
I've never seen anyone jump like  Hogan Martin. They should call him  "The Jumper."
Shush.
Yeah, well, it wasn't really a good  game.
(to Buffy) Yeah, well. I still bet patrolling was  way better. Because, wow, important.
Freddy Munson. He writes those  editorials for the school paper.  He's sardonic.
Well, I think it's good. Right? I mean,  you enjoy your other Slayer powers.
What's it like, Buffy?
I can't help it!
I'm sorry, Buffy. I just can't...
Boy or girl?
We'll do it, Buffy. A list of all the  students.
We have a list of the people in the  cafeteria. I'll do some computer work,  match it against the FBI mass-murderer  profiles. We can rule some people out.
Besides which: Sunnydale high. Center  of Evil and all that. So let's get to work.  We have till lunch time tomorrow.  We hope.
Okay. I've taken our list and narrowed  it to a dozen strong suspects.
These are your personalized  assignments.
Be quiet! Sorry, but this is important.  Talk to everyone on your list. Use  the sample questions. Today, people!
(called after) Oh! Write neatly and label your  worksheets!
Fantasies are fun, aren't they  Jonathan?
We all have fantasies where we're  powerful and respected. Where people  pay attention to us.
But sometimes the fantasy isn't enough,  is it, Jonathan? Sometimes you have to  <u>make</u> it so people don't ignore you. <u>Make</u>  them pay attention. You know what I'm  talking about, don't you?
Right.
He's the only one we couldn't find?
You better believe it, Buster. You can't  threaten a big murder without getting us  pretty darn ticked.
Xander. We have to figure this out.
Buffy!
Jonathan. Ooh. I had him in my grasps,  the slippery weasel.
Jonathan? Are you in here?
So you're feeling better about Angel.
See, that's how it should work.
Hi, Giles. Oh, I should get to the  yearbook office. I'm going to give  them the murderer questionnaires.  They really are good reading.
