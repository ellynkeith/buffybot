(loudly) What secret? Being gay?
Man, I'm out. I'm so out I got my  grandma fixing me up with guys.
But it sounds like <u>you're</u> having a  rough time with it.
Look, just do it.
(to Xander) Look there. That weird Freddy  Munson guy who does the school  paper?
No, dude, but I bet he'd put in, like,  a coming-out announcement for you.  Something tasteful.
