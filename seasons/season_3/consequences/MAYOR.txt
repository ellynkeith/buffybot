Mr. Finch was not only my longtime aide and associate, he was a close personal friend... I promise you - I will not rest until whoever did this is found and brought to justice.
It's not working.
It's supposed to cheer me up! Usually, using the shredder gives me a lift. It's fun.
No. Guess it'll take more than this to turn my frown upside down. I just don't understand why Allan would leave such a paper trail about our dealings. Do you think he was going to betray me? That's a horrible thought. And now he's dead and I'll never have the chance to scold him.
What is it?
You think he talked? To them?
(smiles) Well, this is exciting. A slayer up for Murder One. That's sunshine and roses to me. It really is.
Not one slayer, but two. Right here in the building...
(cutting him off) Shhhh. Here comes my favorite part - where the slayers see us in the hall together, thick as thieves. (burning) Oh, wait - we are thieves. And worse. And now they know it.
We don't have near enough evidence to put them away. No, you're going to have to think of a more efficient solution. And Mr. Trick... You'd better think of it soon.
That's right. I did.
I thought he might be. What with you standing here and all.
