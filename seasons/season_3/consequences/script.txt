REPORTER: ....Authorities and citizens alike were shocked when the slain man was identified as Deputy Mayor, Allan Finch. Still reeling from the news, Mayor Wilkins had this to say:
MAYOR: Mr. Finch was not only my longtime aide and associate, he was a close personal friend... I promise you - I will not rest until whoever did this is found and brought to justice.
JOYCE: Oh, honey. You're up...
JOYCE: It's just terrible - isn't it?
WESLEY: I want you to look into this. Find out everything you can about the murder of the Deputy Mayor.
BUFFY: But, I mean - it's not really our... jurisdiction - is it?
FAITH: It's no big, B. We can get into it if he wants-
GILES: No. Buffy's right. The Deputy Mayor's murder was the result of human malice. There's nothing supernatural about it.
WESLEY: We don't know that for certain. I say it merits investigation.
GILES: Which I'm sure the police are doing. However, if you ask me, there are far better uses of the slayers time-
WESLEY: (pointed) Ah, but, I don't believe I did. Ask you.
GILES: (fuming) Well, considering the success of your last venture you might do well to-
CORDELIA: Don't let me interrupt. Wait. Let me interrupt. I'm in a hurry.
GILES: What did you need?
CORDELIA: (turning back) Psych class. Freud and Jung. Book me.
GILES: Happily.
CORDELIA: Check out Giles, the next generation. What's your deal?
WESLEY: Uh, I, uh - well -
FAITH: New watcher.
CORDELIA: Oh.
WESLEY: Does everyone know about-
BUFFY: She's a friend.
CORDELIA: Let's not exaggerate.
CORDELIA: (flirtatious) So you're the new watcher.
WESLEY: (proffered hand) Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.
CORDELIA: I like a man with two last names. I'm Cordelia.
WESLEY: And you teach psychology?
CORDELIA: I take psychology.
GILES: (returning) She's a student.
WESLEY: (trying to be official) Well then, yes. In fact I am. Here to watch. Girls. I mean Buffy and Faith, in specific.
CORDELIA: Well, it's about time we got some fresh blood.
WESLEY: Ha! Well. Fresh. Yes.
GILES: Here you go.
CORDELIA: Thanks.
CORDELIA: Welcome to Sunnydale.
WESLEY: My. She's... cheeky. Isn't she?
FAITH: First word, "jail," second word, "bait."
WESLEY: Well. Where were we?
BUFFY: Done. (to Faith/trying for calmer) We were done. Weren't we?
FAITH: Yep. Off to patrol. See ya.
WESLEY: One moment, girls. I am your commander now and on the matter of this murder, I am resolved. "Natural" or "super" - I want to know.
FAITH: Fine by me. Always ready to kick a little bad guy butt.
FAITH: You gonna rat me out? Is that it?
BUFFY: We have to tell, Faith. I can't pretend to investigate, can't pretend that I don't know...
FAITH: Oh. I see. You can "pretend" that Angel's still dead when you need to protect him-
BUFFY: I am trying to protect you, Faith. If we don't do the right thing, it'll only make things worse for you.
FAITH: Worse than jail for the rest of my young life? No way.
BUFFY: Faith, what we did-
FAITH: Yeah. We. You were right there beside me when this thing went down. Anything I have to answer for - you do too. You're part of this, B. All the way.
BUFFY: Hey.
WILLOW: Hey... Where's Faith? I saw her around. Figured you guys were off to kill more nasty stuff.
BUFFY: Not right now. She bailed, I guess.
BUFFY: Will - I thought maybe we could-
WILLOW: Actually, I should get-
BUFFY: Sorry... You go.
WILLOW: I'm - late.
WILLOW: I'm meeting Michael, the warlock guy? We're still trying to "de-rat" Amy.
BUFFY: Oh.
WILLOW: So. See you.
BUFFY: See you.
STEIN: So you heard the man scream about what time last night?
WOMAN: I'm not sure. Seven? Maybe eight.
STEIN: Can you be more specific? Say, between seven and seven thirty?
BUFFY: Angel!
ANGEL: Buffy. I've been looking for you. (sees her hand) Your hand!
MAYOR: It's not working.
TRICK: It's supposed to do something Besides shred?
MAYOR: It's supposed to cheer me up! Usually, using the shredder gives me a lift. It's fun.
TRICK: And today you're not getting the ya yas.
MAYOR: No. Guess it'll take more than this to turn my frown upside down. I just don't understand why Allan would leave such a paper trail about our dealings. Do you think he was going to betray me? That's a horrible thought. And now he's dead and I'll never have the chance to scold him.
TRICK: Maybe this will change your mood.
MAYOR: What is it?
TRICK: Bombshell.
TRICK: The Deputy Mayor had wooden splinters in his wound. Struck right through the heart with a sharp, pointed object. Now word is someone was fighting vampires not a block away from the scene. (then) Smart money says - it's a slayer did this job.
MAYOR: You think he talked? To them?
TRICK: If he did, I'm thinking he said the wrong thing.
MAYOR: (smiles) Well, this is exciting. A slayer up for Murder One. That's sunshine and roses to me. It really is.
FAITH: I'm telling you. We did the world a favor. This guy was about as interesting as watching paint dry.
BUFFY: Faith-
FAITH: Joking. Geez, lighten up, B...
FAITH: He came out of nowhere.
BUFFY: (sympathetically) I know.
FAITH: Whatever. I'm not looking to hug and cry and learn and grow. I'm just saying it went down quick, is all.
FAITH: Let's just blow. I mean, who cares what this guy was about? It's kind of moot now - don't you think?
BUFFY: I don't think he was in that alley by chance. I think he was looking for us. Like to know why.
FAITH: (scoffing) So, what, you think there's some big conspiracy-
BUFFY: You were saying?
FAITH: So his papers are gone. That doesn't prove anything.
BUFFY: Except that somebody doesn't want us to prove anything.
FAITH: (wry) So the mayor of Sunnydale is a black hat. Shocker, huh?
BUFFY: Actually - yeah. I didn't get the bad guy vibe off him.
FAITH: When you gonna learn, B? It doesn't matter what kind of "vibe" a person gives off. Nine times outta ten the face they're showing you? It isn't the real one.
BUFFY: I guess you know a lot about that.
FAITH: What's that supposed to mean?
BUFFY: Look at you, Faith. Less than twenty four hours ago you killed a guy. And now you're laughing and scratching and zipidee doo dah. That's not your real face, and I know it. I know what you're feeling because I feel it too.
FAITH: (dubious) Do you? So, fill me in. I'd like to hear this.
BUFFY: Dirty. Like something sick creeped inside you and you can't get it out. And you keep hoping what happened was just some nightmare... (hard) But it wasn't, Faith. And we have to-
FAITH: (cutting her off/unmoved) Is there gonna be an intermission in this?
BUFFY: Let's just talk to Giles. I swear-
FAITH: No way. We're not bringing anybody else into this. You gotta keep your head, B. This is all going to blow over in a few days.
BUFFY: What if it doesn't?
FAITH: If it doesn't... They got a freighter leaving the docks at least twice a day. It's not fancy - but it gets you gone.
BUFFY: And then what? You just live with it? See this dead guy in your head for the rest of your life?
FAITH: Buffy. I'm not going to "see" anything... I missed the mark last night. And I'm sorry about the guy, really. But it happens. (then) Anyway - how many people do you think we've saved by now? Thousands? And didn't you stop the world from ending? In my book, that puts you and me firmly in the plus column.
BUFFY: we help people. That doesn't mean we can do whatever we want-
FAITH: Why not? This guy I offed was no Ghandi. We just saw - he was mixed up in dirty dealing.
BUFFY: Maybe. But what if he was coming to us for help?
FAITH: What if he was? You're still not looking at the big picture, B. Something made us different. We're warriors. We were built to kill-
BUFFY: (cutting her off) To kill demons. But we don't get to pass judgement on people, like we're better than everybody else-
FAITH: We are better. (this stop Buffy) That's right. Better. People need us to survive. In the balance? Nobody's gonna cry over some random bystander who got caught in the crossfire.
BUFFY: I am.
FAITH: Your loss.
JOYCE: Buffy...
STEIN: Tell me again. You got home at what time last night?
BUFFY: Late. A little past one, I guess.
STEIN: Maybe you can explain to me what a girl your age is doing out all night.
FAITH: Just hanging.
STEIN: Hanging? By yourself?
FAITH: No. I was with my friend Buffy.
BUFFY: We were at Faith's. Watching TV.
STEIN: What did you watch?
FAITH: Some old movie.
BUFFY: Infomercial.
STEIN: That's funny. 'Cause I've got a couple witnesses who put you near the alley.
FAITH: Witnesses?
STEIN: (nods) Somebody stabbed this guy through the heart. Strange thing is, the weapon? It was made outta wood. (then) Any of this mean anything to you?
FAITH: Yeah. Whoever did it wasn't hip to the bronze age.
BUFFY: Is that it? I'm - I'm kind of beat.
STEIN: I have enough for now. (then) Buffy. If you know something. If you're protecting someone...
STEIN: ...I promise you it'll be better for everyone if you come clean.
BUFFY: I wish I could help you.
FAITH: You mean, am I covering for someone? Hardly. I'm not the "throw myself on the sword" type.
STEIN: Well. Call me if you "remember" anything.
BUFFY: Hey.
WILLOW: Hey...
BUFFY: I really need to talk to you.
WILLOW: Good. 'Cause I've been letting things fester. And I don't like it. I want to be fester-free.
BUFFY: Yeah. Me too-
WILLOW: (anxious/interrupting) I mean, don't get me wrong. I understand why you and Faith have been doing the bonding thing. You work together - you should get along.
BUFFY: It's more complicated than that.
WILLOW: But, see? It's that exact thing that's ticking me off. This whole "slayer's only" attitude. Since when wouldn't I understand? You talk to me about everything! It's like - all of the sudden I'm not cool enough for you because I can't kill things with my bare hands!
WILLOW: Oh! Oh, Buffy. Don't cry. I'm sorry. I was too hard on you. Sometimes I unleash... and I don't know my own strength. It's bad. (off Buffy's continued tears) I'm bad. I'm a bad, bad person.
BUFFY: Will. I'm in trouble.
BUFFY: ...And Faith just acts like she doesn't care. The way she talks, she doesn't even think she made a mistake.
WILLOW: You think she's like, in shock?
BUFFY: I don't know. But this police guy knows more than he's saying. I think he knew I was lying.
WILLOW: You have to go to Giles, Buffy. He'll know what to do.
BUFFY: Giles?
GILES: Buffy-
BUFFY: Giles, I don't know how to say this so I'm just going to say it. I know I've kept things from you before but-
BUFFY: But... I've been sort of blowing off my classes- you know, in the sense of not attending...
FAITH: It's okay, Buffy. I told him.
BUFFY: (surprised) You told?
FAITH: Had to. He had to know what you did.
BUFFY: What I did?
BUFFY: No. Giles. That's not- That's not what happened-
GILES: I don't want to hear it, Buffy. You've been lying again. To me, to everybody.
BUFFY: What? No! (to Faith/aghast) You can't be serious. You're setting me up?
GILES: Buffy. Go to my office. (almost as sternly) Faith, I'll speak to you in the morning.
BUFFY: Giles-
GILES: Now.
FAITH: I'm... sorry.
BUFFY: Giles. I didn't do this. I swear. I messed up bad, I admit it. But the murder. It was-
GILES: Faith. I know. (off Buffy's surprise) She has many talents, Buffy. Fortunately, lying isn't one of them.
BUFFY: Oh. Oh God. I thought-
GILES: I'm sorry. I needed to see how far she'd take the charade.
BUFFY: Try - far. Like all the way.
GILES: You should have come to me right off.
BUFFY: I know. I wanted to...
GILES: But Faith wouldn't hear of it.
BUFFY: It's not all her fault, Giles. We both thought it was a vamp. I only realized a second before-
GILES: Buffy, this is not the first time something like this has happened.
BUFFY: It's not?
GILES: A slayer is on the front lines of a nightly war, Buffy. It's tragic - but accidents have happened.
BUFFY: What do you do?
GILES: The council investigates, meters out punishment if punishment is due... I've no plan to involve them, however. That's the last thing Faith needs right now. She's unstable, Buffy. She seems utterly unable to accept responsibility. Shows no remorse.
BUFFY: Well, she's freaking, right? I mean, we'll just have to help her deal.
GILES: There is no help for her unless she can admit what happened.
BUFFY: I can talk to her...
GILES: Perhaps...
BUFFY: Or maybe I'm too close- one of the guys could...
GILES: We should meet. They may be seeing a different side of her.
BUFFY: Okay.
GILES: But nobody else is to hear, understood?
WILLOW: Maybe we should all talk to Faith together.
BUFFY: Like the intervention thing you guys did on me? As I recall, Xander and I nearly came to blows.
XANDER: You nearly came to blows, Buffy. I nearly came to loss of limbs.
GILES: No - Faith's too defensive to be confronted in that manner. I think the "one on one" approach is more likely to reach her-
XANDER: I could be the one. On her one. (quickly) Let's rephrase. I mean, I think she might listen to me. We kind of have a "connection."
BUFFY: (dubious) A connection. Like when you say "hi" and she says "hi" and then she blows you off?
XANDER: Something like that. It's just worth a shot, that's all I'm saying.
GILES: I don't see it, Xander. Of all of us, you're arguably the person Faith has had the least contact with.
XANDER: Yeah - but we hung out a little. Recently. And she seemed, uh, responsive.
BUFFY: When did you hang out?
XANDER: She was fighting one of those apocalypse demon things and I helped her. Gave her a ride home.
BUFFY: And you guys talked?
XANDER: Not extensively.
BUFFY: Well then why do you- Oh.
GILES: Ohh.
WILLOW: I don't need to say "oh." I got it before. They slept together.
GILES: (uncomfortable) Fine then, moving on-
BUFFY: Xander - I know you mean well. But I don't see Faith opening up to you. She doesn't take the guys she... "has a connection with" very seriously. They're kind of a big joke with her. No offense.
XANDER: (offended) Oh, no. Why would I find that offensive?
GILES: Buffy's right, Xander. In this instance, it would be best if you let Faith be. (then) However, if you want to be of assistance, I could use some research help. We have this business of the Mayor and Mr. Trick to attend to.
BUFFY: Yeah. They were looking pretty cozy the other night.
GILES: (to Willow) Willow - can you access the Mayor's records?
WILLOW: What? Oh. Sure. I can try.
GILES: Good. It's clearly time we took a harder look at him. He's up to something.
BUFFY: What about Faith?
GILES: I don't know. Give me a little time-
BUFFY: She needs help. Now. (almost to herself) I owe her that, at least.
WESLEY: Yes, hello. I need Mr. Travers, Quentin Travers... Wesley Wyndam Pryce calling. The code word? Monkey... M-O-N-K- (losing patience) Just put him on, would you? This is an emergency.
FAITH: What?
XANDER: Hey.
XANDER: I just wanted to see how you are, actually.
FAITH: Sick of people asking me that, for one thing.
XANDER: Can I come in? Just to talk. Promise.
FAITH: Like you could make something happen if I didn't want it to.
XANDER: Hey, yeah. You got me there. Pretty much, not gonna try to "take you" under any circumstances. (makes a muscle) See? Feel that. Must be like a wet noodle to you.
FAITH: Five minutes.
XANDER: That's all I need. (quickly) For talking. In conversation - I can be quick like a bunny.
FAITH: Clock is running.
XANDER: I just - I heard about what happened, and I thought maybe you needed a friend.
FAITH: So talk to Buffy. She's the one who killed a guy.
XANDER: Yeah. I heard that version-
FAITH: (hard) Version?
XANDER: Either way, sounds to me like it was an accident. That's the important part.
FAITH: No. The important part is - Buffy's the "accidental" murderer.
XANDER: Faith, you may not think so, but I sort of know you. I've seen you post- battle. And I know, first hand, you're... like a wild thing. You don't know what you're doing half the time.
FAITH: You're living proof of that, huh?
XANDER: See - you can try to hurt me, but you need somebody on your side right now. What happened? It's not your fault. And I'm willing to testify to that. In court, if you need me to.
FAITH: You'd dig that, wouldn't you? To get up in front of all your geek pals and go on record about how I made you my boy toy for a night-
XANDER: No. No, that's not it-
FAITH: That's what this is all about, isn't it? You just came here because you want another taste.
XANDER: No... I mean, it was nice, it was great, well, it was kind of a blur, but, okay, someday, sure, yay... But not now, not like this.
FAITH: Then like how? Lights on or off? Kinks or vanilla?
XANDER: (sincere) Come on,Faith. I just wanted to help. I thought we had a connection.
XANDER: Ow! Faith-
FAITH: You want to feel our connection?
FAITH: It's just skin.
FAITH: I see. I want. I take. (then/hard) I forget.
XANDER: No. We- It's more than that-
FAITH: I could do anything to you right now. And you want me to.
XANDER: Ahhh!
FAITH: I could make you scream.
FAITH: I could make you die.
FAITH: Finally decided to tie me up, huh? Always knew you weren't really a one slayer guy.
ANGEL: I'm sorry about the chains. It's not that I don't trust you- (then) Actually. It is that I don't trust you.
FAITH: That thing with Xander? I know what it looked like, but we were just playing-
ANGEL: And he forgot the safety word? That it?
FAITH: Safety words are for wusses.
ANGEL: I bet you're not big on trust games, are you, Faith?
FAITH: (scoffing) You gonna shrink me now, that it?
ANGEL: I just want to talk to you.
FAITH: That's what they all say. Then it's - "just let me stay the night. I won't try anything."
ANGEL: You wanna go the long way 'round, I can do that.
ANGEL: I'm not getting any older.
BUFFY: How's she doing?
ANGEL: Like talking to a wall. Only you get more from a wall.
BUFFY: But you'll keep trying, right?
ANGEL: Sure. We're just getting started.
BUFFY: So what do I do?
ANGEL: (gently) Right now there's nothing you can do.
BUFFY: This could go on for a while, right? So I'll go to Faith's place and get her some of her clothes and stuff. That way she'll see we're on her side - that we want her to be comfortable.
ANGEL: It's not a bad idea.
BUFFY: Great. I'll be back.
ANGEL: I just... Don't get your hopes up, Buffy. She may not want our help.
BUFFY: She does. I know it. She doesn't know how to say it.
ANGEL: She killed a man. That changes everything for her.
BUFFY: Giles said with counseling, she might not have to be locked up, or at least-
ANGEL: That's not what I mean. She's taken a life.
BUFFY: I know.
ANGEL: She's got a taste for it, now.
MAYOR: Not one slayer, but two. Right here in the building...
TRICK: (blustering) There was supposed to be a guard-
MAYOR: (cutting him off) Shhhh. Here comes my favorite part - where the slayers see us in the hall together, thick as thieves. (burning) Oh, wait - we are thieves. And worse. And now they know it.
TRICK: They're not gonna be much of a threat in jail-
MAYOR: We don't have near enough evidence to put them away. No, you're going to have to think of a more efficient solution. And Mr. Trick... You'd better think of it soon.
FAITH: Join the club. Everybody seems to have a theory.
ANGEL: But I know. What it's like, to take a life. To feel a future, a world of possibility - snuffed out by your own hand. I know the power in it. The exhilaration. It was like a drug for me.
FAITH: Yeah? Sounds like you need some help. A professional, maybe.
ANGEL: A professional couldn't have helped me. It stopped when I got my soul back. My human heart.
FAITH: Goody for you. (then) If we're going to party, let's get on with it. otherwise, could you let me out of these things?
ANGEL: Faith. You have a choice. You've tasted something few ever do. To kill without remorse is to feel like a God-
FAITH: Right now - all I feel is a cramp in my wrist. Let me go!
ANGEL: (ignoring) But you're not a God. You're not much more than a child. And this path will ruin you. You can't imagine the price for true evil.
FAITH: Yeah? I hope evil takes Mastercard.
ANGEL: You and me, Faith, we're a lot alike.
FAITH: Well, you're kind of dead...
ANGEL: Like I said. A lot alike.
FAITH: Sorry, buddy. I'm alive and kicking. In fact, I've got a bodily function that needs attending to pretty quick here.
ANGEL: You're not alive. You're just running. Afraid to feel. Afraid to be touched...
FAITH: Save it for Hallmark. I have to pee.
ANGEL: Time was, I thought humans existed just to hurt each other.
ANGEL: But then I came here. And I found out that there were other kinds of people. People who genuinely wanted to do right. They still make mistakes. They fall down. But they keep trying. Keep caring.
ANGEL: If you can trust us, Faith, it can all change. You don't have to disappear into the darkness.
ANGEL: No!
ANGEL: Leave her! You can't help her!
WESLEY: By the order of the Watcher's Council of Britain...
WESLEY: I'm sorry for the extreme measures. Unfortunately, this is a rather extreme circumstance.
FAITH: Whatever.
WESLEY: (sincere) Despite the... violence of your apprehension, please believe - nobody 's rushing to judgement. The first priority of both myself and the council is to help you-
WESLEY: Ah, now. None of that. (to Henchman) Tighten her restraints. (to Faith) Faith. There's no point in fighting this, you know...
FAITH: (to Wesley) Have to disagree with you on that one.
FAITH: Now unlock me, or I'll pop this guy's head like a grape.
FAITH: Don't even think about it.
WESLEY: You can't keep running, you know.
FAITH: Wrong again, Wes.
BUFFY: Angel. Are you all right?
ANGEL: I'm fine. They took Faith-
BUFFY: Who took Faith?
ANGEL: The new watcher. He had a couple of guys helping him.
WILLOW: Then he figured it out. The murder-
GILES: Which means that Faith will soon be on her way to England to face the Watcher's Council.
BUFFY: And then what?
GILES: Most likely? They'll lock her up for a good long while.
BUFFY: So - we head them off at the airport. Stop them.
WILLOW: Can I- I'm just wondering. Why?
WILLOW: I'm not the most objective, I know. I kinda have an issue with Faith sharing my ... people. (then) But - she murdered someone and accused Buffy. Then she hurt Xander. I hate to say it, but maybe she belongs behind bars.
BUFFY: She's out of control, I know. But Angel was getting somewhere with her. She was opening up. If we can just stop Wesley-
BUFFY: You let her get away?
WESLEY: "Let" wouldn't be the way I'd phrase it, but - yes. She escaped.
ANGEL: Good work. First you terrorize her, then you put her back on the streets-
WESLEY: That was hardly my plan. I was trying to save the girl-
BUFFY: (hard) Well, you didn't. You probably destroyed her-
GILES: Buffy. That's enough.
BUFFY: We'd better find her before she does any more damage.
BUFFY: We should split up. I'll take the docks - chances are, she's there. Giles - you go to her place. Will - you and Xander check her haunts. (firmly) Take weapons.
ANGEL: I'll try the airport.
WESLEY: What can I do? I want to help.
BUFFY: Still got your plane ticket back to the mother country?
BUFFY: Not on my friends.
FAITH: Yeah. 'Cause you and me are such solid buds.
BUFFY: Could be. It's not too late.
FAITH: For me to change and be like you, You mean? Little miss goody two shoes? Ain't gonna happen, B.
BUFFY: Faith. Nobody's asking you to be like me. But what you're doing - you can't keep going like this.
FAITH: It scares you, doesn't it?
BUFFY: Yeah, it scares me. You're hurting people. You're hurting yourself-
FAITH: But that's not it. That's not what bothers you so much. What bugs you is - you know I'm right. You know in your gut. We don't need the law. We are the law-
BUFFY: No.
FAITH: Yes. You know exactly what I'm about. Because you have it in you, too.
BUFFY: No. You're sick, Faith-
FAITH: I've seen it, B. You've got the lust. And I'm not just talking about screwing vampires-
BUFFY: (warning) Don't bring him into this-
FAITH: It was good, wasn't it? The sex? The danger? Bet a part of you even dug him when he went psycho-
BUFFY: No-
FAITH: See - you need me to tow the line because you're afraid you'll go over it, aren't you, B? You can't handle watching me living my own way and having a blast - because it tempts you. You know it could be you-
FAITH: (taunting) There's my girl...
BUFFY: No. I'm not going to do this.
FAITH: Why not? It feels good. Blood rising-
TRICK: (licking his lips) I hear once you've tasted a slayer? You never wanna go back.
TRICK: Oh. No. No, this is no good at all-
GILES: Faith saved you?
BUFFY: (nods) She could have left me there to die, Giles. But she didn't.
GILES: And the fact that she opted to come back to town with you bodes well.
BUFFY: I really thought we were gonna lose her.
GILES: She still has a lot to face before she can put this behind her. But yes, she has a real chance. Because you didn't give up on her.
FAITH: You sent your boy to kill me.
MAYOR: That's right. I did.
FAITH: He's dust.
MAYOR: I thought he might be. What with you standing here and all.
FAITH: Guess that means you have a job opening.
