But, I mean - it's not really our... jurisdiction - is it?
She's a friend.
Done. (to Faith/trying for calmer) We were done. Weren't we?
We have to tell, Faith. I can't pretend to investigate, can't pretend that I don't know...
I am trying to protect you, Faith. If we don't do the right thing, it'll only make things worse for you.
Faith, what we did-
Hey.
Not right now. She bailed, I guess.
Will - I thought maybe we could-
Sorry... You go.
Oh.
See you.
Angel!
Faith-
(sympathetically) I know.
I don't think he was in that alley by chance. I think he was looking for us. Like to know why.
You were saying?
Except that somebody doesn't want us to prove anything.
Actually - yeah. I didn't get the bad guy vibe off him.
I guess you know a lot about that.
Look at you, Faith. Less than twenty four hours ago you killed a guy. And now you're laughing and scratching and zipidee doo dah. That's not your real face, and I know it. I know what you're feeling because I feel it too.
Dirty. Like something sick creeped inside you and you can't get it out. And you keep hoping what happened was just some nightmare... (hard) But it wasn't, Faith. And we have to-
Let's just talk to Giles. I swear-
What if it doesn't?
And then what? You just live with it? See this dead guy in your head for the rest of your life?
we help people. That doesn't mean we can do whatever we want-
Maybe. But what if he was coming to us for help?
(cutting her off) To kill demons. But we don't get to pass judgement on people, like we're better than everybody else-
I am.
Late. A little past one, I guess.
We were at Faith's. Watching TV.
Infomercial.
Is that it? I'm - I'm kind of beat.
I wish I could help you.
Hey.
I really need to talk to you.
Yeah. Me too-
It's more complicated than that.
Will. I'm in trouble.
...And Faith just acts like she doesn't care. The way she talks, she doesn't even think she made a mistake.
I don't know. But this police guy knows more than he's saying. I think he knew I was lying.
Giles?
Giles, I don't know how to say this so I'm just going to say it. I know I've kept things from you before but-
But... I've been sort of blowing off my classes- you know, in the sense of not attending...
(surprised) You told?
What I did?
No. Giles. That's not- That's not what happened-
What? No! (to Faith/aghast) You can't be serious. You're setting me up?
Giles-
Giles. I didn't do this. I swear. I messed up bad, I admit it. But the murder. It was-
Oh. Oh God. I thought-
Try - far. Like all the way.
I know. I wanted to...
It's not all her fault, Giles. We both thought it was a vamp. I only realized a second before-
It's not?
What do you do?
Well, she's freaking, right? I mean, we'll just have to help her deal.
I can talk to her...
Or maybe I'm too close- one of the guys could...
Okay.
Like the intervention thing you guys did on me? As I recall, Xander and I nearly came to blows.
(dubious) A connection. Like when you say "hi" and she says "hi" and then she blows you off?
When did you hang out?
And you guys talked?
Well then why do you- Oh.
Xander - I know you mean well. But I don't see Faith opening up to you. She doesn't take the guys she... "has a connection with" very seriously. They're kind of a big joke with her. No offense.
Yeah. They were looking pretty cozy the other night.
What about Faith?
She needs help. Now. (almost to herself) I owe her that, at least.
How's she doing?
But you'll keep trying, right?
So what do I do?
This could go on for a while, right? So I'll go to Faith's place and get her some of her clothes and stuff. That way she'll see we're on her side - that we want her to be comfortable.
Great. I'll be back.
She does. I know it. She doesn't know how to say it.
Giles said with counseling, she might not have to be locked up, or at least-
I know.
Angel. Are you all right?
Who took Faith?
And then what?
So - we head them off at the airport. Stop them.
She's out of control, I know. But Angel was getting somewhere with her. She was opening up. If we can just stop Wesley-
You let her get away?
(hard) Well, you didn't. You probably destroyed her-
We'd better find her before she does any more damage.
We should split up. I'll take the docks - chances are, she's there. Giles - you go to her place. Will - you and Xander check her haunts. (firmly) Take weapons.
Still got your plane ticket back to the mother country?
Not on my friends.
Could be. It's not too late.
Faith. Nobody's asking you to be like me. But what you're doing - you can't keep going like this.
Yeah, it scares me. You're hurting people. You're hurting yourself-
No.
No. You're sick, Faith-
(warning) Don't bring him into this-
No-
No. I'm not going to do this.
(nods) She could have left me there to die, Giles. But she didn't.
I really thought we were gonna lose her.
