You nearly came to blows, Buffy. I nearly came to loss of limbs.
I could be the one. On her one. (quickly) Let's rephrase. I mean, I think she might listen to me. We kind of have a "connection."
Something like that. It's just worth a shot, that's all I'm saying.
Yeah - but we hung out a little. Recently. And she seemed, uh, responsive.
She was fighting one of those apocalypse demon things and I helped her. Gave her a ride home.
Not extensively.
(offended) Oh, no. Why would I find that offensive?
Hey.
I just wanted to see how you are, actually.
Can I come in? Just to talk. Promise.
Hey, yeah. You got me there. Pretty much, not gonna try to "take you" under any circumstances. (makes a muscle) See? Feel that. Must be like a wet noodle to you.
That's all I need. (quickly) For talking. In conversation - I can be quick like a bunny.
I just - I heard about what happened, and I thought maybe you needed a friend.
Yeah. I heard that version-
Either way, sounds to me like it was an accident. That's the important part.
Faith, you may not think so, but I sort of know you. I've seen you post- battle. And I know, first hand, you're... like a wild thing. You don't know what you're doing half the time.
See - you can try to hurt me, but you need somebody on your side right now. What happened? It's not your fault. And I'm willing to testify to that. In court, if you need me to.
No. No, that's not it-
No... I mean, it was nice, it was great, well, it was kind of a blur, but, okay, someday, sure, yay... But not now, not like this.
(sincere) Come on,Faith. I just wanted to help. I thought we had a connection.
Ow! Faith-
No. We- It's more than that-
Ahhh!
