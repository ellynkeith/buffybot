Hi.
So I was wondering if you were free  this weekend, if maybe we could do  some entertaining thing.
We could do something else that  you like. We could watch... sports  of some kind.
Men like sports. I'm sure of it.
Hey, I'm trying, okay? You don't  have to take my head off.
About eight hundred years ago, in the  Koskov Valley, above the Urals. There  was a sorcerer there who achieved Ascension.  Became the embodiment of the demon  Lohesh. I was there cursing a shepherd  who had been unfaithful, his wife  wished that all his sheep would lie with --
Sorry. Lohesh was... it decimated the  village. Within hours. Maybe three  people got out. I've seen some horrible  things in my time -- I've caused most  of them actually, but this...
You've never seen a demon.
All the demons that walk the earth are  tainted, are human hybrids, like vampires.  The Ascension means a human becomes  PURE demon. They're different.
Well for one thing; they're bigger.
It doesn't sound like this is Lohesh,  the rituals are all different.
You know anyone who lives in the  Koskov Valley?
Doesn't ring a bell.
Anywhere. If there's a lunar shuttle  going up any time soon, I'm on it.
Or I might be able to live. You can't  stop the Ascension, Xander; you were  right the first time. The only thing any  sane person can do is run.
Xander.
Hey, I'm packed. My car's right outside.  I just... I had to...
You could come with me.
Why not? We could just get in the car  and drive, no one would miss us. We  could take turns driving, keep each other  awake...
When I think that something might  happen to you, it feels bad. Inside.  Like I might vomit.
It's horrible! No wonder I used to  get so much work.
Come with me.
Why not?
So?
Are you really gonna be that much  help to them? You'll probably just  get in the way.
Fine. You know what? I hope you die.
