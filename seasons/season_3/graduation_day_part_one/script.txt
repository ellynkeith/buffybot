CORDELIA: I can't believe this loser look. I lobbied  so hard for the red, but no one listens  to me, lone fashionable wolf.
XANDER: I like the blue. Has more dignity.
CORDELIA: Dignity? You? In relation to clothes?  I'm awash in a sea of confusion.
XANDER: I just want to look respectable in  this... considering I'm probably  gonna die in it.
CORDELIA: 'Scuse me?
XANDER: I'm telling you, I woke up the other  day with this feeling in my gut, I just  know. There's no way I'm getting out  of this school alive.
CORDELIA: Well, you've certainly mastered the  power of positive giving up.
XANDER: I've been lucky too many times. My  number's coming up. And I was short!  One more rotation and I'm shipping  stateside! You know what I mean?
CORDELIA: Seldom if ever.
WILLOW: Bye, let's keep in touch.
HARMONY: Oh, Willow, will you sign my  yearbook?
WILLOW: Oh, yeah -- and you have to sign  mine too!
HARMONY: You know, I really wish we had gotten  to know each other better.
WILLOW: Me too.
HARMONY: You're so smart. I always wanted to  be like that.
WILLOW: Thanks. You're so sweet.
HARMONY: I hope we don't lose touch.
WILLOW: No, we'll hang out!
HARMONY: Bye!
WILLOW: Oh, I'm gonna miss her...
BUFFY: Don't you hate her?
WILLOW: (with the same affectionate, wishful tone) With a fiery vengeance, she picked  on me for ten years, the vacuous tramp.
BUFFY: Well, I think it's contagious. The whole  senior class has turned into... the 60's.  Or, what I imagine the 60's to have  been like, except without the war and  the hairy armpits.
WILLOW: Well, don't you feel it?
BUFFY: I don't. I mean, I'll miss stuff, but  graduating just isn't that big of a deal  to me. You get a piece of paper and  nothing changes. I don't even think  I'm gonna go.
WILLOW: (sentimental) Oh, trusty soda machine... I push for  rootbeer and you give me coke. (to Buffy) Not gonna go? Why not?
BUFFY: Ascension? Mayor becoming demon,  snacking upon populace? I was  planning to fight him.
WILLOW: We can't do both?
XANDER: Both what?
BUFFY: Fight the Mayor and go to graduation.
XANDER: What, you guys didn't hear?
BUFFY: Hear what?
XANDER: Guess who our commencement speaker is?
WILLOW: (tiny hope) Sigfried?
XANDER: No.
WILLOW: Roy?
XANDER: No.
WILLOW: One of their tigers?
XANDER: Come out of the fantasy, Will.
BUFFY: I don't believe this.
XANDER: Lends credence to my whole "I'm  gonna die" theorem, doesn't it?
BUFFY: The Mayor at graduation. A hundred  helpless kids to feed on. He got any  other surprises for us?
LESTER: Just a moment...
FAITH: Hi, I'm looking for Professor Worth?
LESTER: That's me. But I should ask you to  come by during my office hours,  students generally --
FAITH: Oh, I'm not from the college. I work  for Mayor Wilkins. I'm Faith.
LESTER: (a tad bemused) Oh, come in, please.
FAITH: He's a big fan, Professor.
LESTER: Oh, "Lester" is fine.
FAITH: We alone here, Lester?
LESTER: Well, yes... life long bachelor. Like  my space.
FAITH: I hear that. You wanna turn and face  the wall, Lester.
LESTER: What are -- what are you doing?
FAITH: I'll make it quick.
LESTER: Put that away. (she doesn't) I'll scream...
FAITH: Who wouldn't
LESTER: Please...
FAITH: Sorry, friend. Boss wants you dead.
LESTER: Why...?
FAITH: You know, I never thought to ask.
MAYOR: And everything went smoothly with  Mr. Worth?
MAYOR: Well, that's swell. You know how I  feel about loose ends. And the big day  is so close! You can smell the excitement  in the air. Say, are you ever coming out  of there?
MAYOR: Come on...
FAITH: I feel wicked stupid in this.
MAYOR: You look lovely. Perfect for the Ascension.  Any boys that manage to survive'll  be lining up to ask you out.
FAITH: Yeah, but it's not really me.
MAYOR: "Not you". Let me tell you something.  Nobody knows what you are. Not even  you, little miss seen-it-all. The  Ascension isn't just my day, it's yours  too. Your day to blossom, to show the  world what a powerful girl you are.
FAITH: I hope I don't let you down.
MAYOR: Impossible. Come on. Change back  into your street clothes and I'll buy  you an icee.
PERCY: Rosenberg!
WILLOW: Hey, Percy!
PERCY: Check it out. History final.
WILLOW: B minus! That's great!
PERCY: I'm a scholar! I'm like a scholar!
WILLOW: Congratulations.
PERCY: Listen, thanks, you know? For helping  me, being so patient... and thanks for... (quieter voice) ...not kicking my ass like you did at  the Bronze.
WILLOW: (about to confess) You know, Percy, that was actually...  for your own good.
PERCY: I know, I know...
WILLOW: History is important, you know. 
PERCY: (holding up paper) And I got the grades, so tomorrow  I'm graduating and I can forget all  that school crap.
OZ: On the bright side, after graduation he  may never get the chance to forget it.
WILLOW: Ha ha.
OZ: Just trying to keep things light.
WILLOW: Well, they're not that light. It's bad  enough we have to fight the Mayor -  I don't want him eating Percy and our  whole class. We've gotta find some  spell or something to stop the Ascension.
OZ: Then we'll find one.
MILLER: Thank you for joining us, Mr. Harris.
XANDER: Uh... An 'E.'
MILLER: There is no 'E.'
ANYA: Hi.
XANDER: Hey.
ANYA: So I was wondering if you were free  this weekend, if maybe we could do  some entertaining thing.
XANDER: Would that be along the lines of you  telling me about all the men you  destroyed back in your demon days?  'Cause pencil me in!
ANYA: We could do something else that  you like. We could watch... sports  of some kind.
XANDER: I don't know...
ANYA: Men like sports. I'm sure of it.
XANDER: Yes, men like sports. Men watch the  action movie. They eat the beef and  enjoy to look at the bosoms. A thousand  years avenging our wrongs and that's  all you learned?
ANYA: Hey, I'm trying, okay? You don't  have to take my head off.
XANDER: I'm sorry, I just... I'm not even sure I'm  gonna make it to next weekend. But I  tell you what, I survive the Ascension,  maybe we can do some sports related... (off her look) ...what?
BUFFY: Faith.
WESLEY: You're sure?
BUFFY: This is one of her pieces. I recognize  the brushwork.
GILES: (reads) "Brutally stabbed... Lester Worth,  visiting professor of geology..." (reading further) There's nothing in here that bellows  "motive".
WESLEY: A random killing, perhaps? Fit of rage...  everyone does seem to be going a bit  mad lately, and Faith has something  of a headstart.
BUFFY: Doesn't read. I think this is homework.
GILES: The Mayor wanted the good professor  out of the way.
BUFFY: Which leads to the question, "how  come?" I'm about to destroy the entire  city but I take the time to kill Harmless  Lester first?
GILES: Tying up loose ends. Lester had  something, or knew something...
BUFFY: Then I wanna know too. If the Mayor's  trying to hide, I say we go seek.
WESLEY: (excited) By attempting to keep a valuable clue  from us, the Mayor may have inadvertently  led us right to it!
BUFFY: What page are you on, Wes? We got  there already.
WESLEY: Yes. Well. You'll go tonight, look  over his apartment. Anything at all  worth noting you report back here.
BUFFY: I just love it when you take charge,  you man, you.
WESLEY: Was that a yes? I can't keep track.
BUFFY: I'll go.
GILES: Be careful. If Faith should show up again --
BUFFY: I don't think she will. Been there, killed  that; she's not much for follow up.
GILES: None the less, keep watch. Faith has  you at a disadvantage, Buffy.
BUFFY: 'Cause I'm not crazy or 'cause I don't  kill people?
GILES: Both, actually.
BUFFY: I hear you. I can't kill her... fun though  it sounds... I don't have that in me. I can  make her cry uncle, though, and I mean to.
WESLEY: Don't let your feelings about Faith  interfere with your work.
BUFFY: Stopping Faith IS my work. Take a beat  to love the synergy.
WESLEY: Faith is a footnote. Our priority is  stopping the Ascension.
XANDER: Easier said than done, Monarchy Boy.
WESLEY: Xander, if you don't have something  constructive to add...
XANDER: You guys wanna know about the  Ascension? (presenting Anya) Meet the only living person who's  ever been to one.
ANYA: About eight hundred years ago, in the  Koskov Valley, above the Urals. There  was a sorcerer there who achieved Ascension.  Became the embodiment of the demon  Lohesh. I was there cursing a shepherd  who had been unfaithful, his wife  wished that all his sheep would lie with --
BUFFY: Cut back to the chase.
ANYA: Sorry. Lohesh was... it decimated the  village. Within hours. Maybe three  people got out. I've seen some horrible  things in my time -- I've caused most  of them actually, but this...
WESLEY: I'm sorry... Lohesh was a four winged  Soul killer, am I right? I was given to  understand they aren't that fierce. Of  all the demons we've seen...
ANYA: You've never seen a demon.
BUFFY: Excuse me, killing them professionally  for four years running...
ANYA: All the demons that walk the earth are  tainted, are human hybrids, like vampires.  The Ascension means a human becomes  PURE demon. They're different.
GILES: Different?
BUFFY: How?
ANYA: Well for one thing; they're bigger.
SNYDER: The kids are here, the parents off to  the side there. We'll go up, they'll play  the processional and then you'll give  the address.
MAYOR: It all looks wonderful.
SNYDER: As long as nobody makes any trouble...
MAYOR: Stop worrying. You just make sure the  kids show up. Anybody who doesn't feel  like coming to graduation, well, they  can just live without a diploma.
SNYDER: They'll be here, sir.
MAYOR: Call me Richard. You've done a great  job here.
SNYDER: I believe in order.
MAYOR: Sunnydale owes you a debt. And it  will be repaid.
ANYA: It doesn't sound like this is Lohesh,  the rituals are all different.
GILES: I wish that was a relief.
OZ: What's going on?
WILLOW: How come evil girl's in the mix now?
GILES: Anya witnessed an Ascension.
WILLOW: Oh. Okay, then.
WESLEY: There must be something more useful  you can tell us. (idea) How did they kill it?
ANYA: You know anyone who lives in the  Koskov Valley?
WESLEY: Oh.
BUFFY: What about the spiders? Mayor had a  box of spiders he had to eat. The box  of, of... I wanna say gravlax --
GILES: Gavrok.
ANYA: Doesn't ring a bell.
BUFFY: Well, there must be something you  remember that isn't --
MAYOR: So. This is the inner sanctum. Faith  tells me this is where you folks like to  hang out and concoct your little schemes.  I'll tell you, it's just nice to see that some  young people are still interested in reading  in this modern era.
BUFFY: You never get even a little tired of  hearing yourself talk, do you?
MAYOR: That's one spunky girl you've raised.
BUFFY: Get out.
MAYOR: I smell fear. That's smart. But some of  your deaths will be quick, if that's worth  anything. Well, I'll see you all at graduation.
XANDER: Anya! Wait.
ANYA: Anywhere. If there's a lunar shuttle  going up any time soon, I'm on it.
XANDER: We need you here. You might be able  to help.
ANYA: Or I might be able to live. You can't  stop the Ascension, Xander; you were  right the first time. The only thing any  sane person can do is run.
CORDELIA: What's her saga?
XANDER: She's freaking.
CORDELIA: About what?
XANDER: The Mayor's going to kill us all  during graduation.
CORDELIA: Oh. (beat) Are you going to fifth period?
XANDER: I'm thinking I might skip it.
CORDELIA: Yeah, me too.
JOYCE: Buffy? I'm home, did you want to --
BUFFY: Mom, I need you to leave town. Tonight.
JOYCE: What? Buffy, I'd miss your graduation!
BUFFY: That's kind of the point.
JOYCE: There's no way I'm --
BUFFY: (zipping the case) Mom, graduation is a pointless ceremony  where you sit around and listen to boring  speeches till you get a little piece of paper  that says you graduated which you already  know and dark blue does nothing for my  complexion so don't argue, okay?
JOYCE: What's going on? Is some horrible  demon going to attack the school?
BUFFY: Just promise me you'll be far away from here.
JOYCE: I'm not leaving you to face some awful  monster! If I go anywhere then you're  coming with me.
BUFFY: You know I can't.
JOYCE: Then I can't either.
BUFFY: Mom... I know sometimes you wish  I was different.
JOYCE: Buffy, no...
BUFFY: And I wish I could be a lot of things  for you, a great student, big athlete,  remotely normal... I'm not. But there's  something I do that I do better than  anybody else in the world. I'm gonna  fight this thing. But I can't do that and  worry about you.
JOYCE: Honey, I just --
BUFFY: You stay, you'll get me killed. You  have to trust me. Can you do that?
WILLOW: Arrr! This is so frustrating!
OZ: Nothing useful.
WILLOW: No, it's great. If we need to make ferns  invisible or communicate with shrimp,  I've got the goods right here.
OZ: Our lives are different than other peoples.
WILLOW: (tossing the book) Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna  find a spell to stop the Ascension. I'm  not a witch; I can't even change poor  Amy back into a person.
OZ: But you got the swinging habitrail goin'...  I think Amy's in a good place emotionally.
WILLOW: Oz...
OZ: What?
WILLOW: Could you just pretend to care about  what's happening?
OZ: You don't think I care?
WILLOW: I think we could be dead in two days'  time and you're just being ironic  detachment guy.
OZ: Would it help if I panicked?
WILLOW: Yes! It'd be swell. Panic is a thing that  people can share in times of crisis and,  and everything is scary now, you know,  I don't know what's gonna happen,  there's all sorts of stuff you're supposed  to get to do after high school and I was  really looking forward to it and now  we're probably gonna die instead and  I'd just like to feel that --
OZ: Panicking.
ANGEL: Ow.
BUFFY: That was stealthy.
ANGEL: Not my best entrance... I think they  were mopping in the hall.
BUFFY: What are you doing here?
ANGEL: I checked in with Giles, he asked me  to back you up.
BUFFY: He's worried I'll run into Faith.
ANGEL: You're not?
BUFFY: Gonna happen sooner or later.
ANGEL: What's that?
BUFFY: A report, excavation of some old lava  bed. Guy was a volcano-ologist or something.
ANGEL: Anything in there that connects him  to the Mayor?
BUFFY: Well, I looked through it, and the only  things I understood were the commas.  I'm gonna take some of this stuff to  Giles, see if he can do better.
ANGEL: Let me give you a hand.
BUFFY: Okay. Thanks. I can take it from here.
ANGEL: That's all right. I'll walk you there.
BUFFY: I really don't require an escort, okay?  Big girl, super powers... I don't need  you crowding me.
ANGEL: Didn't think I was.
BUFFY: Of course not! You show up at the prom  and then just disappear into the ozone.  I didn't even know if you were still in town.
ANGEL: (confused) Are you mad at me for being around  too much or for not being around enough?
BUFFY: Duh -- yes.
ANGEL: Which?
BUFFY: What?
ANGEL: I don't get you.
BUFFY: No, you don't. Not anymore.
ANGEL: Are you just making this harder to  make it easier on yourself?
BUFFY: Could you stop with the brainteasers?  I'm just... I wish it was over. Done.
ANGEL: It's not that simple. When the Mayor --
BUFFY: I know. World in peril and we've got  to work together. Well, this is my last  office romance, I'll tell you that.
ANGEL: You want me out of your face?
BUFFY: Isn't it even a little hard for you?
ANGEL: How can you ask me that? Just 'cause  I'm not acting like a brat doesn't mean  I don't feel anything--
BUFFY: (speaking over him) Oh, it's so nice to know what you  really think of me!
ANGEL: (over her) What do you expect me to say if you attack --
BUFFY: (over him) I just don't wanna do this anymore! I  can't have you in my life when I'm trying to --
VAMPIRE: Missed the heart.
FAITH: Meant to.
GILES: There.
ANGEL: Yeah.
BUFFY: On three. One...
ANGEL: (through gritted teeth) I knew you were gonna do that...
GILES: Not too much blood back here...
ANGEL: I heal pretty fast. Should be all right.
BUFFY: I'm just glad Faith's aim is so sucky.
GILES: We're sure it was her?
BUFFY: Well, I've narrowed down our list of  one suspect...
WESLEY: Fascinating...
GILES: What?
WESLEY: It seems our Mr. Worth headed an  expedition on Kawaii. Digging through  old lava beds near a dormant volcano.
BUFFY: I'm not fascinated yet.
WESLEY: He found something underneath. A  carcass, buried in eruption.
GILES: Carcass?
WESLEY: A very large one. Mr. Worth posits that  it might be some heretofore undiscovered  dinosaur.
ANGEL: (standing weakly) A demon?
GILES: Well, yes, there's something the Mayor  would want to keep secret. If this is the  same kind of demon he's turning into  and it's dead, then that means he's only  impervious to harm until the Ascension.  In his demon form, he can be killed.
BUFFY: Great. And all we need is a million  tons of burning lava. We're saved.
ANGEL: It's a start, anyway. If we can --
BUFFY: Jeez, you're a klutz today. You better take it easy until --
ANGEL: Damn.
GILES: We'll have to run some tests.
BUFFY: Angel, you're burning up.
ANGEL: My shoulder's completely numb. It's  poison. I can feel it.
GILES: I'll call the others, get them here. Then  I think we should move Angel to the  safety of his bed before the sun comes up.
BUFFY: You think the guys can find out what  this is?
WESLEY: The council has all the known toxins  on file, mystical or otherwise. I'll contact  them immediately.
BUFFY: Thanks. (to Angel) You're gonna be okay.
WILLOW: I feel different. You know? I guess  that makes sense. Do you feel  different? Oh, no, you've already -  you probably, not a big change for  you, bit it's nice - was it nice?  Should this be a quiet moment?
OZ: I know exactly what you mean.
WILLOW: (smiles, then:) Which part?
OZ: Everything feels different.
WILLOW: Hello?
FAITH: He's dropped, boss.
MAYOR: Applause applause.
FAITH: Right in the back -- He pitches over  and Buffy's freaking, looking around  all panicked... it was a good time.
MAYOR: Well, that should keep her occupied for a spell.
FAITH: What next?
MAYOR: The ritual of Gavrok. I have to ingest  several of the inhabitants of this box.
FAITH: Ingest?
MAYOR: Eat.
FAITH: You're wicked gross.
MAYOR: Well, you don't have to watch. Just go  home, take it easy. Big day tomorrow.
FAITH: You gotta give me something to do.  There's no way I'm sleeping. Don't  you need anyone dead? Or maimed?  I can settle for maimed.
MAYOR: Little firecracker.
FAITH: My mom called me that. When I was  little. I was always running around...
MAYOR: If everything goes smoothly, you  won't have to. But how often do things  go smoothly?
FAITH: So you'll still need me in there.
MAYOR: Always.
FAITH: When I was a kid, a couple miles outside  of Boston there was this quarry, kids  used to swim there. Jump off the rocks...  There was one rock like forty feet up,  I was the only one that would jump it.  All the older kids were too scared.
MAYOR: Not you, though.
FAITH: Nah. I could do it easy.
MAYOR: Get some rest.
FAITH: Good luck with your spiders there.
WILLOW: They should have all of this at the magic  shop. I can run an aural analysis, see if  it's a mystical poison.
XANDER: I'm a little short on cash...
WILLOW: Just tell them it's for me.
XANDER: Right.
ANYA: Xander.
XANDER: What are you doing here? Thought  you'd be in Aruba by now.
ANYA: Hey, I'm packed. My car's right outside.  I just... I had to...
XANDER: What?
ANYA: You could come with me.
XANDER: Come with you? You mean that?
ANYA: Why not? We could just get in the car  and drive, no one would miss us. We  could take turns driving, keep each other  awake...
XANDER: I guess I might
ANYA: When I think that something might  happen to you, it feels bad. Inside.  Like I might vomit.
XANDER: Welcome to the world of romance.
ANYA: It's horrible! No wonder I used to  get so much work.
XANDER: Well, I'm sorry if I give you barfy feelings.
ANYA: Come with me.
XANDER: Can't do it.
ANYA: Why not?
XANDER: I got friends on the line.
ANYA: So?
XANDER: That humanity thing's still a work  in progress, isn't it?
ANYA: Are you really gonna be that much  help to them? You'll probably just  get in the way.
XANDER: Your stock's plummeting here, sweetheart.
ANYA: Fine. You know what? I hope you die.
BUFFY: It's okay... you'll be okay...
GILES: Did you reach the council?
WESLEY: Yes. They, um... (to Buffy) They couldn't help.
BUFFY: Couldn't?
WESLEY: Wouldn't.
GILES: Well did you explain these were special --
WESLEY: Not under any circumstances, and yes,  I did try to convince them.
BUFFY: Try again.
WESLEY: Buffy, they're very firm. We're talking  about laws that have existed longer  than civilization.
BUFFY: I'm talking about watching my lover  die. I have no clue what you're talking  about and I do not care.
GILES: We'll find a cure, Buffy.
WESLEY: The Council's orders are to --
BUFFY: Orders?
WESLEY: You can't turn your back on the Council.
BUFFY: They're in England! I don't think they  can tell which way my back is facing.
WESLEY: Giles, talk to her.
GILES: I've nothing to say just now.
BUFFY: Go back to your Council --
WESLEY: Don't you see what --
BUFFY: Go and tell them that until the next  Slayer shows up they can close up shop.  I'm not working for them anymore.
WESLEY: Don't you see what's happening? Faith  poisoned Angel to distract you, to keep  you out of the Mayor's way. And it's  working. We need a strategy to --
BUFFY: I have strategy. You're not in it.
WESLEY: This is mutiny.
BUFFY: I like to think of it as graduation.
GILES: Yes, of course.
BUFFY: You'll watch him?
GILES: I'll call if there's the slightest change.
WESLEY: Buffy, you don't know what you're doing.
BUFFY: Get a job.
WILLOW: Finding the poison wasn't that hard.  It's a mystical compound -- the Latin  name translates roughly as "Killer of  the Dead". Used on vampires.
BUFFY: And the cure?
WILLOW: There aren't a lot of instances of it  being cured.
BUFFY: But there's some.
WILLOW: One or two. Pretty vague accounts.  (softer) How is he?
OZ: Hold it.
XANDER: You got something?
OZ: I'm not sure...
BUFFY: Be sure.
OZ: Okay. "Killer of the Dead." That's our  boy, and here's a vamp that walked  away from it.
WILLOW: Does it talk about the cure?
OZ: Damn.
BUFFY: Nothing?
OZ: No, it's in here, but...
WILLOW: Completely reversed the effects... Oh.
BUFFY: WHAT?
XANDER: Come on, guys. The suspense is  killing Angel.
OZ: The only cure for this thing is to drain  the blood of a Slayer.
BUFFY: Good.
XANDER: Good? What'd I miss?
BUFFY: No, it's perfect. Angel needs to drain  a Slayer? I'll bring him one.
WILLOW: Buffy, if Angel drains Faith's blood it'll kill her.
BUFFY: Not if she's already dead.
OZ: A leasing agreement, should be recent.  Won't be in her name but if the Mayor's  putting her up it might be in his.
WILLOW: Could be charging it to the city.
OZ: Right. Cross reference. The realty  with municipal funds.
WILLOW: (re: computer) You wanna drive?
OZ: Sorry.
BUFFY: Some of you guys should relieve  Giles after a while. Watch over Angel.
XANDER: I don't mean to play devil's advocate  here, but are you sure you're up for this?
BUFFY: It's time.
XANDER: We're talking To The Death.
BUFFY: I can't play kid games anymore. This  is how she wants it.
XANDER: I just don't want to lose you.
BUFFY: I won't get hurt.
XANDER: That's not what I meant.
BUFFY: Just get me an address.
WILLOW: Got it.
BUFFY: I thought I'd stop by.
FAITH: (smiles) Is he dead yet?
BUFFY: He's not gonna die. Good try, though.  "A" for effort. Your plan?
FAITH: Uh-huh. Mayor got me the poison.  Said it was wicked painful.
BUFFY: There's a cure.
FAITH: Damn. What is it?
BUFFY: Your blood.
FAITH: You come here to get me? Gonna  feed me to Angel?
BUFFY: That's not a problem.
FAITH: Well, look at you, all dressed up in  big sister's clothes.
BUFFY: You told me I was just like you, Faith.  That I was only holding it in.
FAITH: You ready to cut loose?
BUFFY: Try me.
FAITH: Okay then. Give us a kiss.
BUFFY: Stick around.
ANGEL: Buffy...
MAYOR: My god, what a feeling. The power of  these creatures... it suffuses my being.  I can feel the changes begin. My organs  shifting, merging, making ready for  the Ascension. Plus, these babies are  high in fiber and what's the fun of  becoming an immortal demon if you're  not regular, am I right?
VAMPIRE: Sir, there may be trouble. At Faith's.
GILES: Yes. Right, right.
XANDER: Something about the demon?
GILES: Local villagers near the volcano site  make reference to the legend of "Olukai",  that may be a bastardization of "Olvikan".
XANDER: Who's Olvikan?
GILES: I know it's a demon, a very old one...  I might have a picture.
XANDER: Boy, it's a good thing no one ever  wanted to check any of these books  out, huh?
GILES: Yes, very convenient... ah.
XANDER: Come on, Olvikan. Hey...
BUFFY: What's the matter? All that killing  and you're afraid to die?
FAITH: That's mine.
BUFFY: You're about to get it back.
FAITH: Man, I'm gonna miss this...
BUFFY: No...
