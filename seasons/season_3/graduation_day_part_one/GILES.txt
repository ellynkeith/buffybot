(reads) "Brutally stabbed... Lester Worth,  visiting professor of geology..." (reading further) There's nothing in here that bellows  "motive".
The Mayor wanted the good professor  out of the way.
Tying up loose ends. Lester had  something, or knew something...
Be careful. If Faith should show up again --
None the less, keep watch. Faith has  you at a disadvantage, Buffy.
Both, actually.
Different?
I wish that was a relief.
Anya witnessed an Ascension.
Gavrok.
There.
Not too much blood back here...
We're sure it was her?
What?
Carcass?
Well, yes, there's something the Mayor  would want to keep secret. If this is the  same kind of demon he's turning into  and it's dead, then that means he's only  impervious to harm until the Ascension.  In his demon form, he can be killed.
We'll have to run some tests.
I'll call the others, get them here. Then  I think we should move Angel to the  safety of his bed before the sun comes up.
Did you reach the council?
Well did you explain these were special --
We'll find a cure, Buffy.
I've nothing to say just now.
Yes, of course.
I'll call if there's the slightest change.
Yes. Right, right.
Local villagers near the volcano site  make reference to the legend of "Olukai",  that may be a bastardization of "Olvikan".
I know it's a demon, a very old one...  I might have a picture.
Yes, very convenient... ah.
