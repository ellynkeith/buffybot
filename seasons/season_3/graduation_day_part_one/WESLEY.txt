The Council's orders are to --
You can't turn your back on the Council.
Giles, talk to her.
Don't you see what --
Don't you see what's happening? Faith  poisoned Angel to distract you, to keep  you out of the Mayor's way. And it's  working. We need a strategy to --
This is mutiny.
Buffy, you don't know what you're doing.
