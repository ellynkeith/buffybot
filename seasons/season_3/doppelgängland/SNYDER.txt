As far as I'm concerned, this is a marriage made in heaven. Willow Rosenberg, despite her unsavory associations, represents the pinnacle of academic achievement at Sunnydale high. Percy West represents a devastating fast break and fifty percent from behind the three point line.
You've got the brains, he's got the fast break. It's a perfect match.
I want you to tutor him. Percy is flunking history. Nothing seems to be able to motivate him.
You're lazy, self involved and spoiled. That's quite the challenge. But we need a winning year, especially after last year's debacle with the swim team. Can't have our point guard benched. (to Willow) So you are going to take on a little teaching job. I know how you enjoy teaching.
You've gotten a letter of acceptance from every university with a stamp. I think your academic career is safe.
Rosenberg. It's time to give something back to the community. I know you want to help your school out here. Ask me how I know.
I just know.
