HOFFRYN: Do not ask again! Your powers were a gift of the lower beings. You have proved unworthy of them.
ANYA: I was robbed of them!
HOFFRYN: By your carelessness.
ANYA: For a thousand years I wielded the power of the wish. I brought ruin upon the heads of unfaithful men, I offered destruction and chaos for the pleasure of the lowers beings. I was feared and worshipped across the mortal globe and now I'm stuck at Sunnydale High! A mortal! A child! And I'm flunking math.
HOFFRYN: This is no concern of ours. You will live out your mortal life and die.
ANYA: Give me another chance. You can fold the fabric of time. Send me back to that moment and I'll change it. I won't fail again.
HOFFRYN: Your time is passed.
ANYA: Do you have any idea how boring twelfth graders are? I'm getting my powercenter back. And if you won't help me then by the pestilent gods I'll find someone who will.
BUFFY: The Watcher council shrink is heavily into tests. He's got tests for everything. T.A.T.'s, rorschach, associative logic... (finishes sit ups) They have that test to see if you're crazy that asks if you hear voices or have ever wanted to be a florist.
WILLOW: (perky) Oh, I used to -- Wait. Florist means crazy, right? I never wanted to do that.
BUFFY: (re: pencil) Neat.
WILLOW: Thanks. It's all about emotional control. Plus, obviously, magic. You wanna go to the espresso pump? Get sugared up on mochas?
BUFFY: Pass. I'm gonna hit the pool, do some laps.
WILLOW: And how come all the sudden calisthenics? Aren't you sort of naturally buff, Buff? (to herself, pleased) Buff buff!
BUFFY: Well, they've really got us running around on the physical side, too. A lot of precision training and reflex evaluation, and I just wanna... do...
WILLOW: ... better than Faith?
BUFFY: (contrite) So very shallow.
WILLOW: Competition is natural and healthy. And you'll definitely ace her on the psyche tests. Just don't mark the box that says "I sometimes like to kill people."
BUFFY: I know Faith isn't exactly on the cover of Sanity Fair, but she's had it rough. Different circumstances, that could be me.
WILLOW: No way.
BUFFY: We can't control the way we grow up.
WILLOW: No. You're you. She's her. Some people just don't have that in them.
BUFFY: I'm sorry, I know you hate talking about Faith...
WILLOW: No, it's okay.
BUFFY: Really, I --
WILLOW: It doesn't bother me. I mean it.
BUFFY: Uh, Will?
WILLOW: Ooh.
BUFFY: Emotional control.
WILLOW: I'm working on it.
SNYDER: As far as I'm concerned, this is a marriage made in heaven. Willow Rosenberg, despite her unsavory associations, represents the pinnacle of academic achievement at Sunnydale high. Percy West represents a devastating fast break and fifty percent from behind the three point line.
WILLOW: I'm not sure I understand the marriage part.
SNYDER: You've got the brains, he's got the fast break. It's a perfect match.
WILLOW: (nervously glancing at Percy) Match? You want us to breed?
SNYDER: I want you to tutor him. Percy is flunking history. Nothing seems to be able to motivate him.
PERCY: Hey, I'm challenged.
SNYDER: You're lazy, self involved and spoiled. That's quite the challenge. But we need a winning year, especially after last year's debacle with the swim team. Can't have our point guard benched. (to Willow) So you are going to take on a little teaching job. I know how you enjoy teaching.
WILLOW: But I have a lot of work of my own --
SNYDER: You've gotten a letter of acceptance from every university with a stamp. I think your academic career is safe.
WILLOW: Yes, but I still have classes and I don't want --
SNYDER: Rosenberg. It's time to give something back to the community. I know you want to help your school out here. Ask me how I know.
WILLOW: How do y--
SNYDER: I just know.
BUFFY: So he threatened you? With what?
WILLOW: It wasn't anything exactly that he said. It was all in his eyes. I mean, there was some nostril work as well, but mostly eyes.
BUFFY: Snyder needs me to kick his ass.
WILLOW: Oh, no, Buffy, don't get yourself in trouble. I'll be okay. I just hate the way he bullies people. He just assumes their time is his.
GILES: (entering from his office) Willow, get on the computer. I want you to take another pass at accessing the Mayor's files.
WILLOW: Okay.
FAITH: Well, that was a blast.
GILES: How did it go?
FAITH: Princess Margaret here had a little trouble keeping up.
GILES: (to Wesley) How did it go?
WESLEY: Faith... did quite well on the obstacle field. And her... reflexes are improving rapidly. <b>Physically</b>... (pointedly emphasized) she's in good shape. Still a little sloppy, though.
GILES: Do you feel up to taking Buffy out, or shall I?
WESLEY: No, I'll be fine. I just need a minute. And some defibulators, if it's not too much trouble.
BUFFY: I better change.
FAITH: You're gonna love it, B. It's just like fun, only boring.
GILES: Faith, The evaluations are a necessary part of --
FAITH: (contrite) Hey. I know. I'm on board here. Just shooting my mouth off.
FAITH: Good luck.
FAITH: Whatchya doing?
WILLOW: I'm trying to access the Mayor's personal files.
FAITH: Can you do that?
WILLOW: He's got some pretty tricky barriers set up.
FAITH: Can you get past 'em?
WILLOW: Eventually. I'll get through.
MAYOR: Well, that's very interesting.
FAITH: Yeah, I thought so too. Are you serious about this place?
MAYOR: Of course I am! No Slayer of mine is going to live in a fleabag hotel. That place has a very unsavory reputation. There are immoral liaisons going on there.
FAITH: Plus all the screwing. But this is the kick!
MAYOR: We'll keep your old place, in case you need to see your friends there. But from now on --
MAYOR: Shoes! Shoes!
FAITH: Thanks, sugardaddy.
MAYOR: Oh! Faith. I don't find that sort of thing amusing. I'm a family man. Now. Let's kill your little friend.
MAYOR: Oh, don't worry. I wouldn't ask you, not this early in our relationship. I think a vampire attack would look less suspicious anyway.
MAYOR: In the meantime, let's take a look at the rest of the place. If I'm not mistaken, some lucky girl has herself a playstation.
FAITH: No way!
MAYOR: Yes way.
OZ: Hey, Baby.
WILLOW: Oz. Hi.
OZ: There's something about you that's causing me to hug you. (which he is) It's as if I have no will of my own.
WILLOW: Where were you yesterday?
OZ: We got back late, sort of very.
WILLOW: We? Who? Where?
OZ: The Band. We had a gig in Monterrey Sunday night.
WILLOW: You did? How come I didn't know?
OZ: I thought you did...
WILLOW: Maybe I would have liked to go.
OZ: Didn't figure you for missing school.
WILLOW: You think I'm boring.
OZ: I'd call that a radical interpretation of the text. We're playing the Bronze tonight.
WILLOW: I can't. I have too much homework.
OZ: Well, you'll be there in spirit. If you get done early.
WILLOW: Percy! Hey. Listen, why don't we get together at lunch and we can go over your Roosevelt paper, what books you'll need and stuff.
PERCY: What are you talking about?
WILLOW: Tutoring you. The history paper?
PERCY: Snyder said you were gonna do it.
WILLOW: He never said that.
PERCY: What meeting were you in?
WILLOW: Look, I'll pick up the books. Just meet me at lunch and we'll --
PERCY: I don't have time at lunch. I have to hang out.
WILLOW: Oh. Well...
PERCY: What, you got something better to do? Just type it up and put my name on it. And don't type too good. Dead giveaway.
WILLOW: I'm gonna eat this now. It's not lunchtime and I don't even care.
BUFFY: Hey!
XANDER: Willow! Did you remember to tape Biography last friday?
WILLOW: Uh huh.
BUFFY: (to Xander) What did I tell you? Old reliable.
WILLOW: (bitterly) Oh, thanks!
BUFFY: What?
WILLOW: Old reliable? Yeah, great! There's a sexy nickname.
BUFFY: Oh, Will, I didn't mean --
WILLOW: No, it's fine. I'm old reliable.
XANDER: She just meant, you know, the geyser. You're like a geyser of fun that goes off at regular intervals.
WILLOW: That's old faithful.
XANDER: Isn't that the dog that the guy has to shoot --
WILLOW: That's old Yeller.
BUFFY: Xander, I beg you not to help me. (to Will) Will, I didn't mean it in a bad way. I think it's good to be reliable.
WILLOW: Well maybe I don't wanna be reliable all the time. Maybe I'm not just doormat... person. Homework Gal.
XANDER: I'm thinking nervestrike.
WILLOW: Maybe I'll change my look. Or cut class. You don't know. (holds up banana) And I'm eating this banana. Lunchtime be damned!
BUFFY: Willow, I really didn't mean --
WILLOW: (not unkindly) Buffy, I'm storming off. It doesn't work if you come with me.
BUFFY: Oh.
ANYA: Willow?
WILLOW: Uh, hi...
ANYA: Anya. I'm sort of new here. I know Cordelia...
WILLOW: (deadpan) Ooh, fun.
ANYA: Listen, I have this little project I'm working on, and I heard you were the person to ask --
WILLOW: Uh huh. That's me. Reliable dog geyser person. (resigned) What do you need?
ANYA: It's nothing big. Just a little spell I'm working on.
WILLOW: A spell? Ooh. I like the black arts.
ANYA: Yeah. I need a secondary to create a temporal fold. I heard you were a pretty powerful wicca, so...
WILLOW: You heard right, mister. I'm always ready to work some dark mojo. So tell me... (sly smile) ... is it dangerous?
ANYA: Oh, no.
WILLOW: (disappointed) Well, could we pretend it is?
ANYA: The necklace was a family heirloom. Passed down for generations, then it was stolen from my Mom's apartment.
WILLOW: How does the spell work?
ANYA: We both call on Eyrishon, the endless one. Offer up the standard supplication. Then there's a teensy temporal fold - we hope -- I pour the sacred sand on the representation of the necklace and Eyrishon brings it forth from the time and place where it was lost.
WILLOW: Cool.
ANYA: Of course, there's a lot of theory there, but I figure it's worth a shot. Are we ready?
WILLOW: I think so.
ANYA: Eyrishon. K'shala. Meh-uhn.
WILLOW: Diprecht. Doh-tehenlo Nu-Eyrishon.
ANYA: The child to the mother.
WILLOW: The river to the sea.
ANYA: Eyrishon. Hear my prayer.
WILLOW: What was that? That was - what was that?
ANYA: (looking for her necklace) It's not here. It's not here!
WILLOW: Okay, that's a little blacker than I like my arts.
ANYA: Oh, don't be such a wimp.
WILLOW: That wasn't just a temporal fold, that was some weird Hell place. I don't think you're telling me everything.
ANYA: I swear, I'm just trying to find my necklace.
WILLOW: Did you try looking inside the sofa in HELL?
ANYA: Look, we'll try again, and if --
WILLOW: I think emphatically not.
ANYA: I can't do it by myself!
WILLOW: Well, that's a relief. I'm out of here.
ANYA: Fine. Go! Idiot child.
WILLOW: I believe these chicken bones are mine. Magic is dangerous, Anya. It's not to be toyed with. Now if you'll excuse me, I have someone else's homework to do.
ANYA: Nothing. Nothing!
VAMPWILL: This is weird.
LADY: Excuse me, young lady --
PERCY: Hey!
PERCY: Rosenberg? What are you doing? Trick-or-treating?
PERCY: You're supposed to be at home doing my history report. I flunk that class you're gonna be in big trouble with Snyder. Till we graduate, I OWN your ass.
VAMPWILL: Bored now.
VAMPWILL: (pouty) I'm having a terrible night.
VAMPWILL: Wanna make it better?
XANDER: What's going on? Is there a funny thing?
XANDER: Whoah!
XANDER: Back off! You stay the hell away from her!
PERCY: (stunned) Okay. Sure.
VAMPWILL: Xander...
XANDER: Will. Changing the look not an idle threat with you.
VAMPWILL: You're alive!
XANDER: Uh, Will, this is verging on naughty touching here. We don't want to fall back on bad habits -- Hands! Hands in new places.
VAMPWILL: You're alive.
XANDER: You mentioned that earlier. Will, are you okay?
VAMPWILL: No. Everything's different.
BUFFY: Xander, there you are.
XANDER: (eyes on Will) Hey, Buff.
BUFFY: Aren't you going to introduce me to your -- holy god you're Willow.
VAMPWILL: (eyes narrowing) You...
BUFFY: Okay, well, you know what? I like the look. It's extreme, but it looks good, it's a leather thing, it's very... I said extreme already, right?
VAMPWILL: I don't like you.
BUFFY: Will, I'm sorry about today. You know how my foot likes to be in my mouth sometimes, but you really don't have to prove--
VAMPWILL: Leaving now.
XANDER: Willow, I gotta say I'm not loving the new you.
BUFFY: Willow, wait --
VAMPWILL: Get off me!
ALPHONSE: Willow Rosenberg?
VAMPWILL: I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
ALPHONSE: Then we won't talk.
VAMPWILL: You made me cranky...
ALPHONSE: There's been a mistake here. We were sent after a human.
VAMPWILL: Really?
VAMPWILL: Who do you work for?
ALPHONSE: I'm not telling you a thing --
VAMPWILL: Who do you work for?
ALPHONSE: Wilkins, the Mayor.
VAMPWILL: Who do you work for?
ALPHONSE: You...
VAMPWILL: Get your friends. Bring them here. The world's no fun anymore. We're gonna make it the way it was. Starting with the Bronze.
GILES: Ah. Buffy. I thought you were going out tonight, didn't expect...
GILES: What is it?
XANDER: This isn't real.
BUFFY: I can't feel anything. Arms or legs or anything...
GILES: (trying not to cry) She was... truly the finest of all of us.
XANDER: Way better than me...
GILES: (sadly nodding) Much, much better.
BUFFY: We just saw her at lunch... how could...
XANDER: It's all my fault.
GILES: What makes you say that?
XANDER: I don't know... Statistical probability...
BUFFY: (emotion rising) No, it's me... it's me, I called her reliable, she must have gone out and gotten attacked which she wouldn't have done except I called her reliable and now my best friend is --
WILLOW: What's going on?
WILLOW: Jeez, who died? (serious) Oh god! Who died?
XANDER: Back! Get back, Demon!
BUFFY: Willow? You're alive?
WILLOW: Aren't I usually?
WILLOW: I love you guys too... okay, oxygen becoming an issue...
WILLOW: What's going on with these guywHOAH!
GILES: Sorry.
XANDER: Will, we saw you. At the bronze. A vampire.
WILLOW: (defensive) I'm not a vampire.
BUFFY: But you are, I mean you were... Giles, you planning to step in with an explanation any time soon?
GILES: (not a clue) Well, something... something very strange is happening.
XANDER: Can you believe the Watcher council let this guy go?
ANYA: What a day...
ANYA: Gimme a beer.
WAITER: I.D.
WAITER: I.D.
ANYA: (losing it completely) <b>I'm eleven hundred and twenty years old! Just give me a friggin' BEER!</b>
WAITER: I.D.
ANYA: Give me a coke.
DEVON: Man, We gotta get a roadie. Other bands have roadies.
OZ: Other bands know more than three chords. Your professional bands can play up to six and sometimes seven completely different chords.
DEVON: That's just like, fruity jazz bands.
ANGEL: Oz.
OZ: Hey, man. You looking for Buffy?
ANGEL: As always.
OZ: No sightings as of yet, but I think she said she'd show.
DEVON: Hey, man, how'd you like to be our roadie?
ANGEL: Less than you'd think.
OZ: Well, stick around, I'm sure Buffy'll...
OZ: This doesn't look good...
ALPHONSE: Everybody, SHUT UP!
ALPHONSE: All right. Nobody causes any trouble, or tries to leave, and nobody gets hurt.
ANGEL: Why don't I believe him?
OZ: Well, he lacks credibility.
OZ: Can you get out of here?
ANGEL: (looks around) Skylight in the roof. I can make it.
OZ: I think we need some back up.
ANGEL: I think I'm needed here.
OZ: Ten to one. Could get pointless.
WILLOW: Everybody's all afraid. It's just like old times.
OZ: (eyes on Willow) Get Buffy. Do it now.
DEVON: (quietly) Dude. Check out your girlfriend.
VAMPWILL: What's your name?
SANDY: Sandy...
VAMPWILL: (to the crowd) You don't have to be afraid... just to please me. If you're all good boys and girls, we'll make you young and strong for ever and ever. We'll all have fun.
VAMPWILL: If you're not ...
VAMPWILL: Questions, comments...
OZ: Willow. You don't want to do this.
VAMPWILL: I don't? But I'm so good at it.
OZ: Who did this to you?
VAMPWILL: I know you. You're a white hat. How come you're talking to me like we're friends?
ANYA: Because he thinks you're someone else.
ANYA: He thinks you're the Willow that belongs in this reality.
VAMPWILL: Another me...
ANYA: You know this isn't your world. You know you don't belong here.
VAMPWILL: No... this is a dumb world. In my world there are people in chains and we can ride them like ponies.
ANYA: You want to get back there.
VAMPWILL: (pouty) Yeah...
ANYA: So do I.
WILLOW: This is creepy. I don't like the thought that there's some vampire out there that looks like me.
XANDER: Not looks like -- is.
BUFFY: It was you, Willow, in every detail. Except for your not being a dominatrix... as far as we know.
WILLOW: Oh, right. Me and Oz play Mistress of Pain every night. Please.
XANDER: Did anybody else just go to scary visual place?
BUFFY: Oh yeah.
BUFFY: Angel... What is it?
ANGEL: Buffy, I... Something's happened that... (doesn't know how to say it) Willow's dead. (sees Willow) Hey, Willow. (turns back to Buffy) ... (turns back to Willow) (turns back to Buffy) Wait a second.
XANDER: We're right there with you, Buddy.
BUFFY: We saw her too. At the Bronze.
ANGEL: She's there now. With a cadre of Vampires looking to party.
BUFFY: Then we can worry about who she is after we stop a feeding frenzy.
BUFFY: How many are there?
ANGEL: Eight or ten.
BUFFY: (to Giles) Should we call Faith?
GILES: No. I don't want her in combat yet. Not around civilians.
XANDER: Here here.
WILLOW: Guys?
WILLOW: What are we gonna do with... me? Other me.
BUFFY: I don't know, Will. We've just gotta stop them --
WILLOW: I get that. I just sorta wanna know what -- Oh. Hey! Go. I'll catch up.
VAMPWILL: Alone at last...
VAMPWILL: Well, look at me. I'm all fuzzy.
WILLOW: What do I want with you? Dyeh, I mean --
VAMPWILL: Your little schoolfriend Anya said you brought me here. She said you could get me back to my world.
WILLOW: (gets it) Oh. Oh. Oops.
VAMPWILL: But I don't know...
VAMPWILL: I kinda like the two of us. We could be quite a team, if you came around to my way of thinking.
WILLOW: Would that mean we have to snuggle?
VAMPWILL: What do you say...?
VAMPWILL: ...wanna be bad?
WILLOW: This just can't get more disturbing.
WILLOW: Okay, Ack! Ack! No more! You're freaking me out!
VAMPWILL: You don't wanna play, I guess I can't force you. Oh wait. I can.
VAMPWILL: Bitch...
GILES: Amazing.
WILLOW: It's horrible. That's me as a vampire? I mean, I'm so evil, and skanky, (softly, to Buffy) and I think I'm kind of gay.
BUFFY: Just remember, a vampire's personality has nothing to do with the person it was.
ANGEL: Well, actually -- (off Buffy's glare) -- that's a good point.
XANDER: What do we do now?
GILES: We still have to get to the Bronze.
ANGEL: Even if they're supposed to wait for her they might start feeding. Vampires not notoriously reliable.
XANDER: So we charge in, much in the style of John Wayne?
GILES: High casualty risk. I haven't any other plan, though.
BUFFY: I have a really bad idea...
ANGEL: They're still in a holding pattern. That's good; it means they must really be afraid of you.
WILLOW: Well, who wouldn't be?
BUFFY: You okay in that?
WILLOW: It's a little binding. I guess vampires really don't have to breathe...
WILLOW: Gosh. Look at those.
GILES: All right. You go in, try to defuse the situation as much as possible. At least get a few of them to come outside. Even the odds a bit.
BUFFY: First sign of trouble, you give the signal. We come in hard and fast.
XANDER: What is the signal?
WILLOW: Me screaming.
ANGEL: Giles, you and Xander wait at the back entrance.
GILES: Right.
BUFFY: You sure you're up to this?
WILLOW: Well, it was me that started it... sort of. Don't worry. I won't do anything that could be interpreted as brave.
BUFFY: We're right outside.
WILLOW: Hi, I'm back.
ALPHONSE: Did you find the girl?
WILLOW: Yep, I did.
ANYA: Where is she?
WILLOW: I killed her. And sucked her blood, as we vampires do. (to the vamp by the door) I think maybe I heard something out there. Why don't you go check?
ANYA: How could you kill her? She was our best shot at getting your world back!
WILLOW: I don't like that you dare question me. Maybe I'll have my minions take you outside and kill you horribly!
ANYA: Vampires. Always thinking with your teeth.
WILLOW: She bothered me. She's so weak, and accommodating. It's pathetic -- she lets everyone walk all over her and then she gets cranky at her friends for no reason. I just couldn't let her live. (to another vamp) He's been gone a while. Why don't you check on him?
ALPHONSE: Well, boss, since that plan is out, why don't we get to the killing?
VAMPWILL: This is like a nightmare...
CORDELIA: Hello, Giles? (smaller, more hopeful voice) Wesley? (fixing her hair) I just happened to stop by... for books...
VAMPWILL: Hey, you.
CORDELIA: Hey me? Hey me what? I have a name, you know.
VAMPWILL: Uh, Cordelia...
CORDELIA: What'd you do? Lock yourself in the book cage?
VAMPWILL: Yeah. Let me out. (trying to ape Willow) I'm so helpless...
CORDELIA: Okay.
CORDELIA: I think Giles keeps a spare -- yeah. How'd you manage to lock yourself in, anyway?
VAMPWILL: I was... looking at the books, 'cause I like books 'cause I'm so shy...
CORDELIA: Yeah, right. The famous shy girl act all the boys fall for.
VAMPWILL: Open the cage.
CORDELIA: Wait a minute.
CORDELIA: It occurs to me that we've never really had the opportunity to talk. You know, woman to woman, with you locked up.
VAMPWILL: Don't wanna talk. Hungry.
CORDELIA: What could we talk about? Hey, how about the ethics of boyfriend stealing?
WILLOW: I don't know if I feel like killing any more... I'm so bored...
WILLOW: It would be like shooting fish in a barrel. Where's the fun?
ALPHONSE: With all due respect, boss, the fun would be the eating.
WILLOW: Maybe we should let everyone go, give them a thirty second head start --
ANYA: (gets it) Wait a minute!
WILLOW: No, I like my plan.
ANYA: Oh, nice try.
WILLOW: Okay, let's get to the killing. (re: Anya) Why don't we start with her?
ANYA: Why don't we start with you? (to Alphonse) If she's a vampire, I'm the creature from the black lagoon.
CORDELIA: And, okay, it isn't even like I was that attracted to Xander, it was more just that we kept being in these life or death situations and that's always all sexy and stuff. I mean I more or less knew he was a loser but that doesn't make it okay for you to come around and -- what? Do I have something on my neck?
VAMPWILL: Not yet...
CORDELIA: (trying to look) Am I getting a zit?
VAMPWILL: Cordelia, I'm very sorry. I realize I was wrong. I'll never steal your boyfriend again.
CORDELIA: Like you could.
CORDELIA: I <b>should</b> just leave you in there. But I am a great humanitarian and you'll just have to think of a way to pay me back sometime.
VAMPWILL: Okay...
VAMPWILL: How about dinner?
CORDELIA: I didn't mean all that stuff I said before. I want you to have Xander. My blessings on you both...
VAMPWILL: I'm so over him. I need fresh blood.
VAMPWILL: No more hiding...
WESLEY: Back! Creature of the night! Leave this place!
VAMPWILL: Don't wanna.
CORDELIA: I'm sorry...
WESLEY: No no. A little on edge. You know. Men in combat. Grrrr. Are you all right?
CORDELIA: You saved my life.
CORDELIA: Oh, thank you!
WESLEY: Yes, well... Was that vampire...
CORDELIA: Willow. (genuine sadness) They got Willow. (over it) So, you doing anything tonight?
ANYA: I'm just so tired of being around humans and all their baggage, I don't care if I ever get my power back, I think he should eat you.
WILLOW: This girl has a history of mental problems dating back to early childhood. I'm a blood sucking fiend! Look at my outfit!
ALPHONSE: A human. I should have smelled it right away.
WILLOW: A human? Oh yeah? Could a human do this?
ALPHONSE: I'd say -- yeah, human could do that.
ANYA: (simultaneously) Uh huh. Most humans could, yeah ...
WILLOW: Ow! Ow! It's all happy but OW!
OZ: Come on. Devon! let's go!
VAMPWILL: No more snuggles?
WILLOW: Buffy, no!
WILLOW: (to Buffy) Nice reflexes.
BUFFY: Well, I work out.
VAMPWILL: (pouty) This world's no fun...
WILLOW: You noticed that too.
XANDER: So, in your reality I'm like this bad ass vampire, huh? People afraid of me?
XANDER: Oh yeah. I'm bad.
BUFFY: (to Willow) I'm not sure about releasing this thing into the wild, Will. It is a Demon.
WILLOW: I can't kill her.
BUFFY: No, me neither.
WILLOW: I mean, she's not me -- we have a big nothing in common, but -- still. There but for the grace of gettin' bit. We send her to her world, she has a chance. It's the way it should be anyway.
GILES: I think we're ready. (to Anya) Now, no tricks, dear.
ANYA: I don't need tricks. When I have my powers back you will all grovel before me.
GILES: Willow, if you'll complete the circle...
WILLOW: Good luck. Try not to kill people.
WILLOW: Hands! Hands!
VAMPWILL: Oh, fine --
BUFFY: You wanna go out tonight?
WILLOW: Strangely, I feel like staying home. And doing homework. And flossing. And dying a virgin.
BUFFY: You know, you can O.D. on virtue.
WILLOW: Between me and my evil self, I've got double guilt coupons. I see now where the path of vice leads. She messed up everything she touched. I don't ever wanna be like that.
PERCY: Hey, Uh, hi.
WILLOW: Oh, hi. Listen, I didn't have time to --
PERCY: Okay, so I did the outline for the paper on Roosevelt -- (hands it to her) -- but, uh, it turns out there was two president Roosevelts and I didn't know exactly, uh, which I was supposed to do, so I did both -- (hands her another) I know they're kind of short but I can flesh 'em out, here's my bibliography, (hands it to her) I can retype that if, uh... So just let me know what I did wrong, and, and, I'll get on that.
BUFFY: You wanna go out tonight?
WILLOW: Nine sound good?
