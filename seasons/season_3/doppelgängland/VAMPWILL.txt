This is weird.
Bored now.
(pouty) I'm having a terrible night.
Wanna make it better?
Xander...
You're alive!
You're alive.
No. Everything's different.
(eyes narrowing) You...
I don't like you.
Leaving now.
Get off me!
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
You made me cranky...
Really?
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?
Get your friends. Bring them here. The world's no fun anymore. We're gonna make it the way it was. Starting with the Bronze.
What's your name?
(to the crowd) You don't have to be afraid... just to please me. If you're all good boys and girls, we'll make you young and strong for ever and ever. We'll all have fun.
If you're not ...
Questions, comments...
I don't? But I'm so good at it.
I know you. You're a white hat. How come you're talking to me like we're friends?
Another me...
No... this is a dumb world. In my world there are people in chains and we can ride them like ponies.
(pouty) Yeah...
Alone at last...
Well, look at me. I'm all fuzzy.
Your little schoolfriend Anya said you brought me here. She said you could get me back to my world.
But I don't know...
I kinda like the two of us. We could be quite a team, if you came around to my way of thinking.
What do you say...?
...wanna be bad?
You don't wanna play, I guess I can't force you. Oh wait. I can.
Bitch...
This is like a nightmare...
Hey, you.
Uh, Cordelia...
Yeah. Let me out. (trying to ape Willow) I'm so helpless...
I was... looking at the books, 'cause I like books 'cause I'm so shy...
Open the cage.
Don't wanna talk. Hungry.
Not yet...
Cordelia, I'm very sorry. I realize I was wrong. I'll never steal your boyfriend again.
Okay...
How about dinner?
I'm so over him. I need fresh blood.
No more hiding...
Don't wanna.
No more snuggles?
(pouty) This world's no fun...
Oh, fine --
