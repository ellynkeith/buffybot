(perky) Oh, I used to -- Wait. Florist means crazy, right? I never wanted to do that.
Thanks. It's all about emotional control. Plus, obviously, magic. You wanna go to the espresso pump? Get sugared up on mochas?
And how come all the sudden calisthenics? Aren't you sort of naturally buff, Buff? (to herself, pleased) Buff buff!
... better than Faith?
Competition is natural and healthy. And you'll definitely ace her on the psyche tests. Just don't mark the box that says "I sometimes like to kill people."
No way.
No. You're you. She's her. Some people just don't have that in them.
No, it's okay.
It doesn't bother me. I mean it.
Ooh.
I'm working on it.
I'm not sure I understand the marriage part.
(nervously glancing at Percy) Match? You want us to breed?
But I have a lot of work of my own --
Yes, but I still have classes and I don't want --
How do y--
It wasn't anything exactly that he said. It was all in his eyes. I mean, there was some nostril work as well, but mostly eyes.
Oh, no, Buffy, don't get yourself in trouble. I'll be okay. I just hate the way he bullies people. He just assumes their time is his.
Okay.
I'm trying to access the Mayor's personal files.
He's got some pretty tricky barriers set up.
Eventually. I'll get through.
Oz. Hi.
Where were you yesterday?
We? Who? Where?
You did? How come I didn't know?
Maybe I would have liked to go.
You think I'm boring.
I can't. I have too much homework.
Percy! Hey. Listen, why don't we get together at lunch and we can go over your Roosevelt paper, what books you'll need and stuff.
Tutoring you. The history paper?
He never said that.
Look, I'll pick up the books. Just meet me at lunch and we'll --
Oh. Well...
I'm gonna eat this now. It's not lunchtime and I don't even care.
Uh huh.
(bitterly) Oh, thanks!
Old reliable? Yeah, great! There's a sexy nickname.
No, it's fine. I'm old reliable.
That's old faithful.
That's old Yeller.
Well maybe I don't wanna be reliable all the time. Maybe I'm not just doormat... person. Homework Gal.
Maybe I'll change my look. Or cut class. You don't know. (holds up banana) And I'm eating this banana. Lunchtime be damned!
(not unkindly) Buffy, I'm storming off. It doesn't work if you come with me.
Uh, hi...
(deadpan) Ooh, fun.
Uh huh. That's me. Reliable dog geyser person. (resigned) What do you need?
A spell? Ooh. I like the black arts.
You heard right, mister. I'm always ready to work some dark mojo. So tell me... (sly smile) ... is it dangerous?
(disappointed) Well, could we pretend it is?
How does the spell work?
Cool.
I think so.
Diprecht. Doh-tehenlo Nu-Eyrishon.
The river to the sea.
What was that? That was - what was that?
Okay, that's a little blacker than I like my arts.
That wasn't just a temporal fold, that was some weird Hell place. I don't think you're telling me everything.
Did you try looking inside the sofa in HELL?
I think emphatically not.
Well, that's a relief. I'm out of here.
I believe these chicken bones are mine. Magic is dangerous, Anya. It's not to be toyed with. Now if you'll excuse me, I have someone else's homework to do.
What's going on?
Jeez, who died? (serious) Oh god! Who died?
Aren't I usually?
I love you guys too... okay, oxygen becoming an issue...
What's going on with these guywHOAH!
(defensive) I'm not a vampire.
Everybody's all afraid. It's just like old times.
This is creepy. I don't like the thought that there's some vampire out there that looks like me.
Oh, right. Me and Oz play Mistress of Pain every night. Please.
Guys?
What are we gonna do with... me? Other me.
I get that. I just sorta wanna know what -- Oh. Hey! Go. I'll catch up.
What do I want with you? Dyeh, I mean --
(gets it) Oh. Oh. Oops.
Would that mean we have to snuggle?
This just can't get more disturbing.
Okay, Ack! Ack! No more! You're freaking me out!
It's horrible. That's me as a vampire? I mean, I'm so evil, and skanky, (softly, to Buffy) and I think I'm kind of gay.
Well, who wouldn't be?
It's a little binding. I guess vampires really don't have to breathe...
Gosh. Look at those.
Me screaming.
Well, it was me that started it... sort of. Don't worry. I won't do anything that could be interpreted as brave.
Hi, I'm back.
Yep, I did.
I killed her. And sucked her blood, as we vampires do. (to the vamp by the door) I think maybe I heard something out there. Why don't you go check?
I don't like that you dare question me. Maybe I'll have my minions take you outside and kill you horribly!
She bothered me. She's so weak, and accommodating. It's pathetic -- she lets everyone walk all over her and then she gets cranky at her friends for no reason. I just couldn't let her live. (to another vamp) He's been gone a while. Why don't you check on him?
I don't know if I feel like killing any more... I'm so bored...
It would be like shooting fish in a barrel. Where's the fun?
Maybe we should let everyone go, give them a thirty second head start --
No, I like my plan.
Okay, let's get to the killing. (re: Anya) Why don't we start with her?
This girl has a history of mental problems dating back to early childhood. I'm a blood sucking fiend! Look at my outfit!
A human? Oh yeah? Could a human do this?
Ow! Ow! It's all happy but OW!
Buffy, no!
(to Buffy) Nice reflexes.
You noticed that too.
I can't kill her.
I mean, she's not me -- we have a big nothing in common, but -- still. There but for the grace of gettin' bit. We send her to her world, she has a chance. It's the way it should be anyway.
Good luck. Try not to kill people.
Hands! Hands!
Strangely, I feel like staying home. And doing homework. And flossing. And dying a virgin.
Between me and my evil self, I've got double guilt coupons. I see now where the path of vice leads. She messed up everything she touched. I don't ever wanna be like that.
Oh, hi. Listen, I didn't have time to --
Nine sound good?
