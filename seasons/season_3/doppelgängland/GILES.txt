How did it go?
(to Wesley) How did it go?
Do you feel up to taking Buffy out, or shall I?
Faith, The evaluations are a necessary part of --
Ah. Buffy. I thought you were going out tonight, didn't expect...

(trying not to cry) She was... truly the finest of all of us.
(sadly nodding) Much, much better.
