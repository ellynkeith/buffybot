So, what, you're telling me never?
I'm curious. Never ever?
Come on, really? All this time and not  even once?
So?
What are friends for? I'm sorry.  It's just, all that sweating nightly,  side-by-side action, and you never  put in for a little after hours… (grunts)
You think too much.
How do you know?
Yaaahhh!!!
Nicely diverted, B.!
Hey, this isn't a Tupperware party,  it's a little harder to plan.
Hey, they're toast and we're here so  it couldn't have been too bad. Who  were those guys, anyway?
New watcher.
Screw that.
You actually gonna take orders from him?
Whatever we want! We're slayers,  girlfriend. The Chosen Two. Why  should we let him take all the fun  out of it?
Oh, like you don't dig it.
Liar. I've seen you. Tell me staking  a vamp doesn't get you a little bit juiced.  Say it.
Aah! Can't fool me. The look in your  eyes right after a kill? Just get hungry  for more.
Tell me that if you don't get in a good  slaying, after a while you start itching  for some vamp to show up so you can  give him a good…
Hey, slaying's what we were built  for. If you're not enjoying it, you're  doing something wrong.
Tell you what. You do the  homework, and I'll copy yours.
What are you doing, hiding in there?
Six against two now. Come on.
No. No. No.
And there might be more. Come on.
Who said I had a plan? I don't know  how many's down there but I wanna  find out and I'll know when I land  and if you don't come in after me…
I might die!!
(laughing) You noticed that too?
Buffy! Son of a bitch, I'll…
BUFFY!!!
B. - gotta go!
Tell me you don't get off on this.
Hey girlfriend. Bad time?
Vampires.
Good for us. Bad for them. I found  a nest.
Rise and shine, people.
(to boys) Call me!
I say we take 'em all, hard and  fast, now.
Well, I guess Jacuzzi boy isn't  going anywhere, I just wish we -
Oh. That's too good.
Score.
Strangely - not my priority.
B. When are you gonna get this?  A slayer's life is simple. Want?
Take.
Have.
You wish.
I like him.
He's butch.
Yeah, we're the Slayers. (to Buffy) You wanna get out of here?
Can't save the world in jail.
Five people already have, the racket  we made. And they're fine.
Let's get out of here.
Ready? Gotta motor. Hey Willow.
You're quiet tonight.
Yeah, I'm dying to test out the long  bow. I think it's gonna be my new  thing.
Hey, how do you feel about getting  some ribs? You know, after we're  done?
Screw it.
I think we got more coming…
They keep coming one at a time, we  got a shot.
I didn't know… I didn't know…
Come on!
God.
Hey.
Five by five. You know me.
Thanks.
I was doing my job.
Wrong.
I don't need it.
Okay. This is the last time we're  having this conversation, and we're  not even having it now, you  understand me? There is no body.  I took it, weighted it, and dumped it  in a river. The body does not exist.
It is to me.
No. You don't get it. (in her face) I. Don't. Care.
