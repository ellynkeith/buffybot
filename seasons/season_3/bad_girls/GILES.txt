Really.
Well, you're in no danger of finding  any here.
Controlled circumstances. Hello,  Buffy.
New watcher.
Not in the strictest sense.
That sounds familiar.
El Eliminati. Fift -
You seem to know them well.
So why haven't we seen them before  this?
So you don't think the amulet poses  a threat of some kind?
Buffy, do you think you could -
That's everything. Knock yourself  out… please…
You have to get to know her.
(looking at his watch) Where is she?
Are you all right?
Of course.
Should have returned them on time.
I know. I feel just sick about it.
My attachment to the Slayer is not a  problem. In point of fact it's very  useful -
If you want to criticize my methods,  fine. But you can keep your snide  remarks to yourself and while you're  at it, stop criticizing my methods!
Well… no time like the present…
Doesn't look too promising, does it?
Well, thank God you're here. I was  planning to panic.
That would be your demon. You  know, the dead one.
If it's someone to scrub those hard to  reach areas, I'd like to request that  you kill me.
You don't want to be doing that again.
Why not? We're about to be tortured  to death.
Shut your gob, you ninny! You'll  get us both killed!
(to Balthazar) Tell you what. Let Captain  Courageous go and I'll tell you  what you want to know. How's  that deal?
DOWN!
Welcome to the field.
You killed him.
