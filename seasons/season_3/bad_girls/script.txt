FAITH: So, what, you're telling me never?
BUFFY: Faith, really. Now is not the time.
FAITH: I'm curious. Never ever?
FAITH: Come on, really? All this time and not  even once?
BUFFY: How many times can I say it? I have  never…
BUFFY: Done it…
BUFFY: With Xander!
BUFFY: He's just a friend.
FAITH: So?
FAITH: What are friends for? I'm sorry.  It's just, all that sweating nightly,  side-by-side action, and you never  put in for a little after hours… (grunts)
BUFFY: Thanks for the poetry, and no. I  love Xander, I just don't… <i>love</i>  Xander. Besides, I think it ruins  friendships to do stuff like that.
FAITH: You think too much.
BUFFY: There's one left.
FAITH: How do you know?
BUFFY: I think too much.
BUFFY: (quietly) On three…
BUFFY: (to herself) Three.
FAITH: Yaaahhh!!!
FAITH: Nicely diverted, B.!
BUFFY: That wasn't diverting! That was  fighting for my life, Miss Attention  Span.
FAITH: Hey, this isn't a Tupperware party,  it's a little harder to plan.
BUFFY: "The count of three" is not a plan.  It's Sesame Street.
FAITH: Hey, they're toast and we're here so  it couldn't have been too bad. Who  were those guys, anyway?
BUFFY: No idea. They sure didn't look local.  Grab the weapons, would you?  Maybe Giles can…
TRICK: Check these out.
MAYOR: I just love the Family Circus. That  P.J.'s getting to be quite a handful.
MAYOR: Well. Haven't seen anything like  this in… well, in a good long while.  Where is the owner of these fine  implements?
TRICK: The common term is "slain". But  I've been seeing this breed around.  We expecting any trouble?
MAYOR: Do you like Family Circus?
TRICK: (dead serious) I like Marmaduke.
MAYOR: (shudders) Oh! He's always on the furniture.  Unsanitary.
TRICK: Nobody's tellin' Marmaduke what  to do. My kind of dog.
MAYOR: I like to read "Cathy".
MAYOR: So, what about these swords?  What should we do about that?
MAYOR: Let's just keep an eye out. We've  got the dedication coming up in a  few days - we certainly can't have  anything interfering with that.
MAYOR: Well, maybe we should postpone  the… dedication…
TRICK: I'm thinking the honorable Mayor  hates that idea.
MAYOR: The dedication is the final step before  my ascension. I have waited longer  than you can imagine for this. After  the hundred days, I'll be on a higher  plane. And I'll have no more need for…
MAYOR: … Well, let's just say I won't be  concerned with the little things.  Mr. Trick, watch these people.  Anything you find out about them…  well, let's try to see that that  information reaches the slayers.
MAYOR: With any luck, they'll kill each other.  And then everyone's a winner.  Everyone, of course, being me.
XANDER: Harvard, Yale, Wesleyan…
BUFFY: Wow, Willow. Looks like early  admission came early this year.
OZ: Hence the name.
XANDER: M.I.T., Barnard, some German  Polytechnical Institute whose name  I can't pronounce… Is anyone else  intimidated? Because I'm just  expecting paper-thin slips with the  words "no way" written on them in  crayon.
OZ: They're typing those now.
WILLOW: I'm so overwhelmed. I got in! To  colleges. Real live colleges! And  now they're wooing me. They're  pitching woo!
BUFFY: The wooing stage is always fun.
WILLOW: But weird, too. Rejection I can handle  from my long years of training in the  field. But this…
XANDER: I feel your pain, Will. Like, right  now? I'm torn between the fast- growing industries of appliance  repair and motel management.  Of course, I'm still waiting to hear  from The Corndog Emporium, so…
BUFFY: Embrace it, Will. This is a great time.  There's nothing standing between you  and a whole new world.
OZ: Except - if I could suggest? Graduate.  Getting left back? Not the thrill ride  you'd expect.
CORDELIA: That's so cute, planning life as a loser.  Most people just turn out that way,  but you're really taking charge.
XANDER: The comedy stylings of Miss Cordelia  Chase, everybody. Who incidentally  won't be needing a higher education  when she can just market her own  very successful line of Hooker Wear.
CORDELIA: Well Xander, I could dress more like  you but, oh. My father has a job.
XANDER: I won't waste the perfect comeback  on you now, but don't think I don't  have it. Oh yes, its time will come.
XANDER: So. Life beyond high school. Anyone.  For the love of God, please, chime in.
BUFFY: I hear it's nice. And, a place I'll never  go if I don't pass Mrs. Taggart's chem.  test tomorrow.
WILLOW: I can help. Chemistry's easy. It's  just like witchcraft, only there's not  as much newt. What do you say?  Study jam at my house? Tonight?
BUFFY: I'm there.
BUFFY: I gotta check in with Giles, report on  last night's patrol.
WILLOW: Oh, that's right. He said he needed  to talk to you.
BUFFY: What about? Is he all right?
WILLOW: Well, he's looked better…
WESLEY: Of course, training procedures have  been updated quite a bit since your  day. Much greater emphasis on field  work.
GILES: Really.
WESLEY: Oh yes. It's not all books and theory  nowadays. I have in fact faced two  vampires - under controlled  circumstances, of course.
GILES: Well, you're in no danger of finding  any here.
WESLEY: Vampires?
GILES: Controlled circumstances. Hello,  Buffy.
WESLEY: Well, hello!
BUFFY: New watcher.
GILES: New watcher.
WESLEY: Wesley Wyndam-Pryce. It's very  nice to meet you.
BUFFY: (to Giles) Is he evil?
WESLEY: Evil?
BUFFY: The last one was evil.
WESLEY: Oh, yes, Gwendolyn Post, we all  heard. A sad example of the  seductive power of dark knowledge.  Mr. Giles has checked my credentials  rather thoroughly and phoned the  council but I'm glad to see you're on  the ball as well, a good slayer is a  cautious slayer.
BUFFY: (to Giles) Is he evil?
GILES: Not in the strictest sense.
WESLEY: (a hint of peeve) Well, I'm glad that's cleared up.  And as I'm sure none of us is anxious  to waste time on pleasantries, why  don't you tell me everything about  last night's patrol.
BUFFY: Vampires.
WESLEY: Yes?
BUFFY: Killed 'em.
WESLEY: Anything else you can tell me?
BUFFY: One of them had swords. I don't think  he was with the other two.
WESLEY: Swords? One long, one short?
BUFFY: (nodding) Both pointy. With jewels and stuff.
GILES: That sounds familiar.
WESLEY: It should.
GILES: El Eliminati. Fift -
WESLEY: Fifteenth century duelist cult. Deadly  in their day, their numbers dwindled  in later centuries, due to an increase  in antivampire activity and a lot of  pointless dueling. They eventually  became the acolytes of a demon  called Balthazar, who brought them  to the new world. Specifically, here.
GILES: You seem to know them well.
WESLEY: I didn't get this job because of my looks.
BUFFY: I really really believe that.
WESLEY: I've researched this town's history.  Extensively.
GILES: So why haven't we seen them before  this?
WESLEY: They were driven out a hundred years  ago. Balthazar was, happily, killed.  I'm not sure by whom.
BUFFY: And they're back 'cause…
WESLEY: Balthazar had an amulet, purported to  give him strength. When he was killed,  it was taken by a wealthy landowner -  I don't want to bore you with the details…
BUFFY: Little bit late…
WESLEY: …Named Gleaves. It's buried with  him and I believe the few remaining  Eliminati are probably looking for it.  For sentimental value.
GILES: So you don't think the amulet poses  a threat of some kind?
WESLEY: Not at all. None the less, we may as  well keep it from them. Buffy, you  will go to the Gleaves family crypt  tonight and fetch the amulet.
BUFFY: I will?
WESLEY: Are you not used to being given  orders?
BUFFY: Giles always says please when he  sends me on a mission. And  afterwards, he gives me a cookie.
WESLEY: I don't feel like we're getting off  on quite the right foot -
WESLEY: Ah! This is perhaps Faith?
FAITH: New watcher.
BUFFY: New watcher.
FAITH: Screw that.
BUFFY: Now, why didn't I say that?
GILES: Buffy, do you think you could -
BUFFY: I'll see if I can get her back. (to Wesley) Don't say anything incredibly  interesting while I'm gone.
WESLEY: They'll get used to me.
BUFFY: Faith, wait.
BUFFY: I know this new guy's a dork, but… (long pause) …I have nothing to follow that, he's  just a dork.
FAITH: You actually gonna take orders from him?
BUFFY: That's the job. What else can we do?
FAITH: Whatever we want! We're slayers,  girlfriend. The Chosen Two. Why  should we let him take all the fun  out of it?
BUFFY: That'd be tragic, taking the fun out  of slaying and stabbing and  beheading…
FAITH: Oh, like you don't dig it.
BUFFY: I don't.
FAITH: Liar. I've seen you. Tell me staking  a vamp doesn't get you a little bit juiced.  Say it.
FAITH: Aah! Can't fool me. The look in your  eyes right after a kill? Just get hungry  for more.
BUFFY: You are way off base.
FAITH: Tell me that if you don't get in a good  slaying, after a while you start itching  for some vamp to show up so you can  give him a good…
BUFFY: Again with the grunting. I'm not  comfortable with that.
FAITH: Hey, slaying's what we were built  for. If you're not enjoying it, you're  doing something wrong.
BUFFY: Uh, what about our assignment?
FAITH: Tell you what. You do the  homework, and I'll copy yours.
BUFFY: Strike one…
BUFFY: Game over.
BUFFY: Aah!
BUFFY: Faith!
FAITH: What are you doing, hiding in there?
BUFFY: Looking for an amulet. Wasn't really  counting on the special guest stars.  Six against one - hence the hiding.
FAITH: Six against two now. Come on.
BUFFY: Wait. Stop. Think.
FAITH: No. No. No.
BUFFY: It's a manhole. Tight space, no  escape - and six against two - not  unlike three against one.
FAITH: And there might be more. Come on.
BUFFY: You're just going in? That's your  plan?
FAITH: Who said I had a plan? I don't know  how many's down there but I wanna  find out and I'll know when I land  and if you don't come in after me…
FAITH: I might die!!
WESLEY: These are all the diaries, then?  Yours included?
GILES: That's everything. Knock yourself  out… please…
WESLEY: (looking) Ah yes. Here's your first entry. (reads) "Slayer is willful and insolent." That  would be our girl, wouldn't it?
GILES: You have to get to know her.
WESLEY: (reading further) "… her abuse of the English  Language is such that I understand  only every other sentence…"  This is going to make fascinating  reading.
GILES: (looking at his watch) Where is she?
WESLEY: Not to fret. My mission scenario  has her back in a minute or so.  Shouldn't be any trouble.
BUFFY: We're surrounded!
FAITH: (laughing) You noticed that too?
VINCENT: Let's settle this honorably.
VINCENT: Well, then, we'll just settle it.
FAITH: Buffy! Son of a bitch, I'll…
FAITH: BUFFY!!!
BUFFY: I hate it when they drown me.
FAITH: B. - gotta go!
BUFFY: We came for the amulet…
BUFFY: …We're not leaving without it.
FAITH: Tell me you don't get off on this.
BUFFY: Didn't suck.
WESLEY: Well. Looks authentic enough.  Of course, there are tests to be  made before actual verification…
BUFFY: How about verifying that your "nearly  extinct" cult was out in magnum  force last night? Faith and I got into  a serious party situation.
GILES: Are you all right?
BUFFY: I had to lather, rinse, and repeat about  five million times to get the sewer  out of my hair, but otherwise, I'm  of the good.
WESLEY: Perhaps there were a few more of  them than we'd anticipated, but  I'd expect you to be ready for  anything. Remember the three  key words for any slayer:
WESLEY: Preparation. Preparation.  Preparation.
BUFFY: That's one word three times.
BUFFY: Oh my God. I have a chem. test. It's  so sad that I'm happy about that.  Giles. We gotta talk.
WESLEY: Buffy, I must ask you to remember  that I am your watcher. From now  on, anything you have to say about  slaying, you say to me. The only  thing you need to discuss with Mr.  Giles is… overdue book fees.  Understood?
BUFFY: We'll talk.
GILES: Of course.
BUFFY: About the overdue book fees.
GILES: Should have returned them on time.
WESLEY: You're not helping.
GILES: I know. I feel just sick about it.
BUFFY: It was intense. It was like I just let  go, you know, and I became this force.  I just didn't care any more.
WILLOW: Yeah, I know what that's like -
BUFFY: I don't think you can. It's kind of a  slayer thing; I don't even think I'm  explaining it well.
XANDER: You're explaining it a <b>lot</b>, though…
TAGGART: All right. You have one period to fill  out your test booklets, periodic charts  are included in the back, and you're  on the honor system, so remember…  no talking.
BUFFY: Well, the thing was, Faith knew I  didn't want to go down there -
TAGGART: Ahem. Ms. Summers?
TAGGART: You have one hour.
BUFFY: Okay, so the best part -
WILLOW: Buffy? Test. You know, the one you  didn't come over to study for?
BUFFY: Right. Got it. Sorry. (to Xander) …so, we're in the sewers, right, and  Faith has three of them on her…
XANDER: Hey. Whoa, can we resume Buffy's  ode to Faith later? Like when I'm not  actively multiple-choicing?
BUFFY: How come your eye always twitches  when I talk about Faith?
XANDER: What? No it doesn't.
BUFFY: "Faith."
XANDER: Cut it out, we got a test to take, I'm  highly caffeinated and trying  to concentrate. (unconvincing) Some of us care about school, you  know.
FAITH: Hey girlfriend. Bad time?
WILLOW: She can't. (to Buffy) You can't. Can you?
WILLOW: Buffy! This is fifteen percent  of the final grade, and that's…
WILLOW: …apparently meaningless.
BUFFY: What's up.
FAITH: Vampires.
BUFFY: Uh, Faith? Unless there's a total  eclipse in the next five minutes - it's  daylight.
FAITH: Good for us. Bad for them. I found  a nest.
BUFFY: (grinning) That has potential…
FAITH: Rise and shine, people.
BUFFY: This is your wake up call.
BUFFY: Angel!
BUFFY: Not leaving, are you?
ANGEL: Saw you making friends.
BUFFY: Them? Boys. I like you.
BUFFY: What's the matter? (playing) You're not afraid of little me, are you?
ANGEL: We better sit down.
BUFFY: Okay. I can sense this is a business  trip. What's the what?
ANGEL: Balthazar.
BUFFY: Dead demon.
ANGEL: Not as dead as you'd think. Word on  the street puts him in the packing  warehouse on Devereau. He's looking  for -
BUFFY: -- his amulet. Yeah. It's supposed  to restore his strength.
ANGEL: From what I'm hearing, that's not  something we'd like to see happen.
BUFFY: Well, we've got the amulet.
ANGEL: I know, I spoke to Giles. But he said  you gave it to -
WESLEY: There you are!
BUFFY: Wow, speak of the really annoying  person.
WESLEY: Well, you're certainly giving me a  run for my money. (pulling her aside) I think we should establish that when  you go out slaying, you leave me a  number where I can -
ANGEL: Where's the amulet?
WESLEY: Who are you?
BUFFY: He's a friend. Do you have it?
WESLEY: It's somewhere very safe.
WESLEY: How did you -
BUFFY: It pooches your jacket.
WESLEY: Now hold on a minute.
ANGEL: Walking around with this thing  is like wearing a target.
BUFFY: (to Angel) You'll put it somewhere safe that's  actually safe?
ANGEL: (rising) I'll do it now.
BUFFY: (also rising) I'm gonna do a little recon on  Balthazar.
WESLEY: Okay, people? Balthazar is dead.  Am I the only one who remembers  that?
ANGEL: Be careful.
BUFFY: You know me…
ANGEL: I mean it.
WESLEY: What's going on…?
FAITH: (to boys) Call me!
BALTHAZAR: Let me tell you what I see.
BALTHAZAR: I see fear. And remorse. And the  pitiful look of faces which cry out  for mercy. What I don't see is  what I want to see and THAT'S  MY AMULET!
VAMPIRE: Lord Balthazar. We found it. We  had it. But, the slayers…
BALTHAZAR: Already I'm bored.
BALTHAZAR: Vincent. Come here.
BALTHAZAR: Closer. Closer.
BALTHAZAR: Let me tell you what I want to see.
BUFFY: Okay. We got ten, maybe twelve  bad guys and one big demon in  desperate need of a stairmaster.
FAITH: I say we take 'em all, hard and  fast, now.
BUFFY: Okay. But - we need a little more  firepower than… (hands empty) …none. We should get to the library.
FAITH: Well, I guess Jacuzzi boy isn't  going anywhere, I just wish we -
FAITH: Oh. That's too good.
FAITH: Score.
BUFFY: Think they're insured?
FAITH: Strangely - not my priority.
FAITH: B. When are you gonna get this?  A slayer's life is simple. Want?
FAITH: Take.
FAITH: Have.
BUFFY: Want, take, have. I'm getting it.
COP: I said drop the weapons or I fire.
COP: Now spread 'em!
FAITH: You wish.
COP: Hands in the air where I can see  'em. Slow. Good. (to the other cop) Cuff 'em.
FAITH: I like him.
FAITH: He's butch.
COP: That's some artillery you two are  putting together. You with one of  them girl gangs?
FAITH: Yeah, we're the Slayers. (to Buffy) You wanna get out of here?
FAITH: Can't save the world in jail.
BUFFY: We should call an ambulance.
FAITH: Five people already have, the racket  we made. And they're fine.
COP: Unnggh…
FAITH: Let's get out of here.
JOYCE: Admit it.
JOYCE: Some days you just want to wake  up and say, to hell with the diet.  You wanna make waffles? Big  Saturday brunch?
BUFFY: I'm not really that hungry.
JOYCE: What did you and Faith do last night?
BUFFY: Nothing. I mean, it's not important.
JOYCE: Don't worry, I won't meddle in your  slaying. Just so long as you're being  careful…
BUFFY: I am.
JOYCE: You sure about those waffles?
BUFFY: No thanks, but I could help make  them if you want them…
JOYCE: No, they only don't have calories  if I make them for you. (off her look) Mom logic. Are you done with the  paper?
JOYCE: Let's see what's happening in  Sunnydale.
MAYOR: Thank you, fellas. Thanks a heap.  Have fun on the camping trip.  Don't forget to roast a wiener for  me, now! Bye bye!
MAYOR: You can come out now.
MAYOR: Backbone of America, those little  guys. Seeing the hope and courage  on their bright little faces - I swear,  I could just eat 'em up.
MAYOR: So, any news about the Eliminati?
VINCENT: Yaaaahhhh!!!!
VINCENT: In the name of Lord Balthazar, die!
MAYOR: Thank you, Mr. Trick. That was  very thoughtful of you.
TRICK: Why do they always got to be  sword fighting? It's called an uzi,  ya chump. Woulda saved your  ass right about now.
MAYOR: Curious how he could have gotten  all the way into my liquor cabinet.  Allan, don't we have security guards  working in this building?
MAYOR: Sir… I… I had no idea…
MAYOR: No need to swoon, Allan, but let's  try to keep things secure. (re: Vincent) Lock him up.
TRICK: He wakes up, he's just gonna try  and kill you again.
MAYOR: Yes. Yes, I expect he will.
BALTHAZAR: Vincent made a noble effort. Man  to man, as befits a true warrior.  He had courage. He had honor.  And I have <b><u>JACK</u></b> TO SHOW FOR  IT!
BALTHAZAR: It has been a hundred years since my  enemy crippled me. Now ultimate  power is within his grasp and I will  not see it happen. This town is MINE  to destroy. My amulet will give me  strength, strength to kill him, to kill  all my enemies, to burn this world to  a cinder! Forget about honor! Forget  about everything but getting my amulet!  Bring the watchers to me. Find the  Slayers and kill them. Kill everything  that gets in your way! GO!!!
BUFFY: Mmm…
WILLOW: You like it?
BUFFY: Smells nice. What is it?
WILLOW: Just a little something we witches  like to call a "protection spell."
BUFFY: Good deal. Protection. (sniffs again) I'm surprised, spell stuff is usually  a lot more…
WILLOW: Stinky? That's why I added the aloe.  Give me time, and I could be the first  Wicca to do all my conjuring in a pine- fresh scent. So what's the plan?
WILLOW: For tonight's slayage. We're going,  aren't we?
BUFFY: Uh… yeah.
WILLOW: Great!
BUFFY: But, there's a "but" here, and it's…  but you shouldn't. Come. Tonight.  Is that cool?
WILLOW: Sure. Makes sense. You'll be facing  big, hairy danger…
BUFFY: Biggest. And, yes, hairy. Think  danger with a beard.
WILLOW: You're risking your life.
BUFFY: Right, and why risk yours?
WILLOW: Because I'm your friend.
BUFFY: I know, Will, and that's exactly  why I don't want you coming.  It's too dangerous.
WILLOW: But, I've done this sort of thing  before. Like a million times. I  can totally handle myself and  besides… (holds up bag) Minty fresh protection. So?
FAITH: Ready? Gotta motor. Hey Willow.
WILLOW: Hi.
BUFFY: Uh, look, I really should… but  later, we'll hang. Okay?
WILLOW: Okay. You go ahead, I'll just get  my stuff.
WILLOW: Stupid.
FAITH: You're quiet tonight.
BUFFY: I just wanna get this done.
FAITH: Yeah, I'm dying to test out the long  bow. I think it's gonna be my new  thing.
BUFFY: I can't believe you went back for  that stuff.
FAITH: Hey, how do you feel about getting  some ribs? You know, after we're  done?
WESLEY: I didn't say you had emotional  problems! I said you had AN  emotional problem. It's very  different.
GILES: My attachment to the Slayer is not a  problem. In point of fact it's very  useful -
WESLEY: The way you've handled this  assignment is something of an  embarrassment to the council -
GILES: If you want to criticize my methods,  fine. But you can keep your snide  remarks to yourself and while you're  at it, stop criticizing my methods!
WESLEY: The fact is, you are no longer qualified  to act as watcher. It's not your fault,  you've done well, but it's time for  somebody else to take the field.
GILES: Well… no time like the present…
FAITH: Screw it.
FAITH: I think we got more coming…
BUFFY: We may never even make it to the  warehouse.
FAITH: They keep coming one at a time, we  got a shot.
BUFFY: Keep moving.
BUFFY: That was too easy…
BUFFY: Faith, WAIT!
BUFFY: Don't move -
FAITH: I didn't know… I didn't know…
BUFFY: We have to call 911. (to him) Don't move, it's okay.
BUFFY: I need a rag… something to…
FAITH: Come on!
BUFFY: Wait, we should go back -
BUFFY: Angel!
ANGEL: Buffy. I've been looking for you.
ANGEL: Your hand!
BUFFY: I'm okay…
ANGEL: I've just been to the warehouse, I was  waiting for you. They've got Giles.
FAITH: God.
WESLEY: Oh god, Oh God…
GILES: Doesn't look too promising, does it?
WESLEY: (freaking) Stay calm, Mr Giles, we have to stay  calm.
GILES: Well, thank God you're here. I was  planning to panic.
WESLEY: What is that thing?
GILES: That would be your demon. You  know, the dead one.
WESLEY: There's no need to get snippy.
BALTHAZAR: Bring them closer.
BALTHAZAR: You know what I want.
GILES: If it's someone to scrub those hard to  reach areas, I'd like to request that  you kill me.
GILES: You don't want to be doing that again.
WESLEY: Are you out of your mind? This is  hardly the time for games!
GILES: Why not? We're about to be tortured  to death.
BALTHAZAR: He's not wrong about that.
WESLEY: Now hold on! We can deal with this  rationally. We have something you  want. You have something we want.
BALTHAZAR: Ah, a trade… intriguing. No. Wait.  Boring. Pull off his kneecaps.
WESLEY: NOO!! The slayer gave it to  someone! A tall man! A friend of  hers! I'll tell you everything!
GILES: Shut your gob, you ninny! You'll  get us both killed!
WESLEY: But… I like to have… my kneecaps…
BALTHAZAR: You will tell us everything.
WESLEY: Yes… sir…
BALTHAZAR: What is this friend's name?
WESLEY: (terrified realization) Ooh. Didn't actually catch it.
GILES: (to Balthazar) Tell you what. Let Captain  Courageous go and I'll tell you  what you want to know. How's  that deal?
BALTHAZAR: There is one deal! You will die  slowly or you will die quickly!  The man who has my amulet -  <b>what is his name</b>?
ANGEL: His name is Angel.
WESLEY: Aaaahhh!!!
BALTHAZAR: Unacceptable! Unacceptable!
WESLEY: Uh… Mr. Giles?
GILES: DOWN!
GILES: Welcome to the field.
BALTHAZAR: Yaarrrgghhh!!!
GILES: You killed him.
BUFFY: (quiet) Yeah. Hooray for me.
BALTHAZAR: Slayer…
BALTHAZAR: You think you've won?
BALTHAZAR: When he rises… you'll wish I had  killed you all.
MAYOR: (Latin) Potestatem matris nostrae in  tenebris invoco… maledictum  filium tuum ab omni periculo  custodias nunc et in saecula!
MAYOR: (English) I call upon the forces of our mother  in darkness, protect your unholy son  from harm… now… and forever!
MAYOR: I don't understand why Allan  would miss this. He's usually so  punctual.
TRICK: So? Did it work?
MAYOR: Let's find out. Open the cage.
TRICK: You sure?
MAYOR: Hold on.
MAYOR: Okay! Now we're ready.
MAYOR: Well…
MAYOR: This officially commences the hundred  days. Nothing can harm me until the  ascension. Gosh, I'm feeling chipper.  Who's for a root beer?
BUFFY: Hey.
FAITH: Hey.
BUFFY: Are you… how are you doing?
FAITH: Five by five. You know me.
BUFFY: Yeah. I know you think you can  handle this. And you're used to  being on your own. You got your  tough loner act down pretty well.
FAITH: Thanks.
BUFFY: And maybe its not an act. But right  now, we need each other. We need  to talk about what we're going to do.
FAITH: I was doing my job.
BUFFY: Being a slayer is not the same as  being a killer.
BUFFY: You can't shut me out on this, Faith.  Sooner or later, we both have to deal.
FAITH: Wrong.
BUFFY: I can help you.
FAITH: I don't need it.
BUFFY: Yeah? Who's wrong now?  You can shut off all the  emotions you want, but there's  still the fact that sooner or  later, they have to find a body.
FAITH: Okay. This is the last time we're  having this conversation, and we're  not even having it now, you  understand me? There is no body.  I took it, weighted it, and dumped it  in a river. The body does not exist.
BUFFY: But getting rid of the evidence isn't  making the problem go away.
FAITH: It is to me.
BUFFY: Faith. You don't get it. You killed a  man.
