(scrutinizing gift) Fab. What's the occasion?
(her expression sours) <i>Airport</i>. What's next? You gonna  want me to help a buddy of  yours move a sofa?
(reluctantly) Sorry. (off his look) Sir.
This is a thing of beauty, Boss.
(smiling) Got any particular eyes in mind?
(almost to herself) Surprise.
What are you, the narrator? Get  the keys to the cuffs.
No. But it'll cut through bone.
I made him an offer he couldn't survive.
(pleased protest) Go on...
Nothing.
Naw. I'm over it. She can have him.
But lookee what we got.
What?
Anybody with brains, anybody  who knew what was going to  happen to her, would be trying to  claw her way out of this place.  But, you, you just can't stop  Nancy Drewing, can you?
Oh, yeah, please give me the  speech again: "Faith, we're still  your friends, we can help you,  it's not too late."
You try to hurt me, I try to hurt  you. I'm just a little more efficient.
You're begging for some deep pain.
Let's see what we can do about that.
(sotto, to Willow) I got someone. I got him.
Boss?
Boss!
