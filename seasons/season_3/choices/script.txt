FAITH: (scrutinizing gift) Fab. What's the occasion?
MAYOR: Faith. As if I need a reason to  show you my affection...
FAITH: (her expression sours) <i>Airport</i>. What's next? You gonna  want me to help a buddy of  yours move a sofa?
MAYOR: (sternly) This isn't a free ride here, young  lady. I'm beginning to think  somebody's getting a <i>lit-tle</i> spoiled. (reaching for the gift) Maybe I should just take this ba-
FAITH: (reluctantly) Sorry. (off his look) Sir.
MAYOR: (softening) That's my girl. Another cookie?
FAITH: This is a thing of beauty, Boss.
MAYOR: Cost a pretty penny, so you just  take good care of it. And be  careful you don't put somebody's  eye out with that thing. Until I  tell you to.
FAITH: (smiling) Got any particular eyes in mind?
BUFFY: Sorry, honey!
ANGEL: That's okay...
BUFFY: There's something you don't see every day. (wearily) Unless, of course, you're me.
ANGEL: (joining her) That was bracing. You wanna do  one more sweep?
BUFFY: It's what I live for. Sad to say...
ANGEL: You too tired?
BUFFY: (to Angel) No, it's just... Don't you kinda  get the feeling we're in a rut?
ANGEL: A rut?
BUFFY: You never take me any place new.
ANGEL: What about that fire demon nest  in the caves near the beach?  Thought that was a nice change  of pace.
BUFFY: So this is our future? Is this how  we're going to spend our nights  when I'm fifty and you're... the  exact same age you are now?
ANGEL: Let's just get you to fifty.
BUFFY: Liking that plan.
JOYCE: When were you going to tell me?
BUFFY: Okay, busted. Didn't think you'd  miss them. Here's me taking them off.
JOYCE: You were accepted to  Northwestern University? (hugging her) Honey, I'm so proud of you.  That's wonderful.
BUFFY: Oh. Right. Wonderful.
JOYCE: I mean, it isn't cheap, but I know  we can make it work if your  Father pitches in. Not that  Northwestern's your only option;  it's a great school, though. I'm so  <b>proud</b> of you.
BUFFY: You said that before.
JOYCE: And will again soon.
BUFFY: Mom, you know I can't--
JOYCE: Oh, I know, sweetheart. I'm just  so pleased you have so many  choices. Oo, my cousin Arlene  and her family are in Illinois. I've  got to call and tell them.
BUFFY: (turning back) You're proud of me?
JOYCE: Don't forget to put my earrings  back in my dresser before you go out.
SNYDER: Okay, what's in the bag?
STUDENT: (confused) My lunch.
SNYDER: Oh, is that the new drug lingo?
SNYDER: Sit up straight.
WILLOW: Sounds like your mom's in a  state of denial.
BUFFY: More like a continent of denial.  She's got to realize I can't leave.  U.C. Sunnydale. At least I got in.
WILLOW: Well, maybe not now. But soon. Maybe. (off Buffy's look) Or maybe I too hail from  Denialland.
BUFFY: Faith's turn to the dark side of  the force has pretty much put the  proverbial kibosh on any away  school plans for me. But, you...  I can't believe you got into  Oxford!
WILLOW: It's pretty exciting...
OZ: You're into some deep academia there.
BUFFY: That's where they make Gileses!
WILLOW: I know! I could learn and have  scones! Although I don't know  how I feel about going to school  in a foreign country.
XANDER: Everything in life is foreign territory.
BUFFY: Making the open dumpster your cafeteria.
XANDER: Go ahead, mock me...
OZ: Think she just did.
XANDER: We Bohemian, anti- establishment types are used to being persecuted.
OZ: Well, sure. You're all so weird.
WILLOW: I think it's neat, you doing the  back-packing, trail mix, happy  wanderer thing.
XANDER: I'm aware it kind of scores a bit  high on the hokey-meter, but I  think it'll be good for me. Help  me to find myself.
CORDELIA: And help us to lose you.  Everyone's a winner.
XANDER: Well, look who just popped open  a fresh can of venom. Hey,  Cordy, hear about Will gettin'  into Oxnard?
WILLOW: Oxford.
XANDER: And MIT and Yale and every  other college on the face of the  planet? As in your face I rub it...
CORDELIA: Oh, whoopie. Oxford. Four years  in Tea Bag central sounds like a  thrill. MIT is a clearasil ad with  housing, and Yale's a dumping  ground for people that didn't get  into Harvard.
WILLOW: I got into Harvard.
XANDER: Any clue what college <b>you'll</b> be  attending? So we can start  calculating minimum safe  distance...
CORDELIA: None of your business. Certainly  nowhere near you losers.
BUFFY: Remember to breathe between  insults, guys.
CORDELIA: I'm sorry, Buffy. This  conversation is reserved for  people who actually HAVE a future.
OZ: (re: Cordy) Angry young woman.
WILLOW: Buffy, she was just being  Cordelia. Only more so. Don't  pay any attention to her.
XANDER: She's definitely got a chip going.
WILLOW: Well, if you didn't goad her so much-
XANDER: I can't help it. It's my nature.
WILLOW: You need a better nature.
WESLEY: I don't understand.
BUFFY: I don't think I can talk any  slower, Wes. I want to leave.
WESLEY: What -- now?
BUFFY: Not now -- after I graduate! College!
WESLEY: But you're a Slayer.
BUFFY: I'm also a person! You can't just  define me by my slayerness;  that's... somethingism.
GILES: Buffy, I know we talked about  your going away--
BUFFY: I got into Northwestern.
GILES: (warmly) That's wonderful news. Good for you.
WESLEY: All right, everyone: Monsters,  Demons, world in peril...
BUFFY: I bet they have all that stuff in  Illinois.
WESLEY: You cannot leave Sunnydale.  With the power invested in me  by the Council, I forbid it.
GILES: Oh, yes. That should settle it.
WESLEY: With Faith gone bad, and the  Mayor's Ascension coming up--
BUFFY: I know it's complicated. I'm  aware that my graduation may  be, among other things,  posthumous. But what if I stop  the Ascension. What if I capture Faith?
GILES: I very much hope you will, but--
BUFFY: I do that, then all you two have  to do is keep the run-of-the-mill  unholy forces at bay through  mid-terms. I'll be back here in  time for homecoming, and every  school break after that... Can we  at least think about it?
WESLEY: Perhaps if circumstances were different...
BUFFY: I'll make them different.
WESLEY: What?
BUFFY: I'm sick of waiting for Mayor  McSleaze to make his move,  while we sit on our hands  counting down to Ascension  Day. For once, let's take the fight to them.
WESLEY: No, no... Much too reckless.  We're at a distinct disadvantage.  We don't know enough--
GILES: She's right.
BUFFY: I gotta have a plan? Really? I  can't just be pro-active with pep?
GILES: You want to take the fight to  them. I suggest the first step  would be to find out what  exactly they're up to.
BUFFY: I actually knew that. I thought  you meant a real specific plan,  you know, with maps and stuff.  So. Great. Find out what they're  up to.
COURIER: He in the car?
LACKEY: (opening the car door) No. I'll take you to him.
COURIER: The Mayor was supposed to be  here in person. With the money.
LACKEY: (showing him the briefcase) Got it right here.
COURIER: Uh huh. Well, the price just went  up. I don't like surprises.
FAITH: (almost to herself) Surprise.
LACKEY: You killed him.
FAITH: What are you, the narrator? Get  the keys to the cuffs.
LACKEY: That won't cut through steel.
FAITH: No. But it'll cut through bone.
MAYOR: Hey ho! There it is.
FAITH: I made him an offer he couldn't survive.
MAYOR: You are one heck of a girl, you  know that? I mean, geez. The  initiative! The skill!
FAITH: (pleased protest) Go on...
MAYOR: I will! I tell you, if Buffy  Summers walked in here and told  me she wanted to switch to our  side? I'd say - "no thanks, sister!  I've got all the slayer one man  could ever need."
FAITH: Nothing.
MAYOR: It's cause I said the "B" word,  huh? Don't tell me you're still  sore about that whole Angel and  Buffy thing?
FAITH: Naw. I'm over it. She can have him.
MAYOR: Better believe she can. She  <u>deserves</u> that poor excuse for a  creature of the night. You, on the  other hand, can do better.
BUFFY: (all cheerful and friendly-like) So, what's in the box?
BUFFY: The Box of Gavrok. It houses  some kind of great demonic  energy or something which His  Honor needs to chow down on  when A-Day rolls around.
WESLEY: What's that?
GILES: (to Buffy) Maps and stuff.
WILLOW: Plans for city hall. They were in  the Water and Power mainframe.
BUFFY: The box is being kept under  guard in a conference room on  the top floor.
WESLEY: (taking charge) Well, now ... Here's what I think  we should--
BUFFY: I figure best to hit it from the  roof. I'll take Angel with me.
GILES: Agreed.
XANDER: (re: blueprint) There's a fire-ladder on the east- side of the building of the building.
WESLEY: Yes, fine. But you'll still need--
GILES: It won't be enough to simply  gain possession of the box.
WILLOW: Right. We have to destroy it.  Not just physically, but ritually.  With some down and dirty black magic.
WESLEY: Hang on, we don't know what  such a ritual would require--
GILES: I think the breath of the  Entropics is standard for this sort  of thing. Fairly simple recipe.
XANDER: (taking the book) I know. I'm ingredient-gettin' guy.
WESLEY: All right. Stop! I demand  everyone stop this instant.
BUFFY: Hop on the train or get off the tracks.
WESLEY: The Mayor will most assuredly  have supernatural safeguards  protecting the box. Oh, we all  forgot about that.
BUFFY: Looks like a job for Wiccan Girl.  What do you think, Wil? Big  time danger.
WILLOW: Hey, I eat danger for breakfast.
XANDER: But oddly enough, she panics in  the face of breakfast foods.
BUFFY: Let's get to work.
XANDER: Your snide remarks earlier? I'm guessing grapes a little on the sour side.
CORDELIA: (reaching into her purse) And, once again, the gold-medal  in the Being Wrong Event goes  to Xander "I'm As Stupid As I  Look" Harris.
XANDER: (seemingly humbled) Wow. Those are great colleges. I  guess they must have seen a  different side of your father's  money.
CORDELIA: Go away.
XANDER: Sure. If you'll excuse me, I have  to get back to helping to save  lives. Carry on, I know you have  important accessorizing to do.
GILES: Remember, if something should  go awry, Wesley and I will try to  create a diversion.
WESLEY: Let's synchronize our watches. I  have exactly eleven six...
WILLOW: Maybe we can just count one-one  thousand, two-one thousand...
GILES: Be careful. All of you.
XANDER: Hey.
OZ: Hey. You got the goods?
XANDER: Essence of Toad. (holds up another) Twice Blessed Sage... or maybe  that's the toad.
OZ: We'd better be sure. Destroying  this box is supposed to be a  pretty delicate operation.
XANDER: Then they shouldn't leave it in  the hands of the lay people.
OZ: Will's got it pretty well laid out.
XANDER: Wow, she even drew helpful  diagrams. That's the pedestal?
OZ: And all the ingredients. And us.  See. There's me - and that's you.
XANDER: How can you tell which is  which? They both look kinda  stick-figure-y to me.
OZ: That's me. That's my guitar, see?
XANDER: Oh. Got ya.
OZ: (proudly) Nobody like my Will.
XANDER: No sir, there is not.
OZ: Okay. Toad me.
WILLOW: (Latin) Sis modo dissolutum exposco, validum scutum! Diutius nec defende a manibus arcam, intende! (English) Be now dissolved, I demand, o powerful shield; no longer defend the box from our hands. Hear us!
WILLOW: Oh, yeah, I'm bad.
BUFFY: Four stars, Wil. Now take off.
WILLOW: Taking off.
BUFFY: Got it!
ANGEL: It's jammed.
BUFFY: Like very much to come up now, please.
ANGEL: I know!
BUFFY: Don't suppose you want to help  get me down.
MAYOR: Well, this is VERY unfortunate.  I just had this conference room  redecorated, for Pete's sake. At  taxpayers expense!
FAITH: But lookee what we got.
BUFFY: How did you -- you -- how did  this happen?
GILES: We thought she stayed with you.
ANGEL: They must have grabbed her  when she hit the ground. Buffy,  I'm sorry --
BUFFY: It's nobody's fault; we just gotta  focus and deal. Oz, I swear I  won't let them hurt her.
XANDER: We go back. Full on assault.
GILES: They'll kill her.
WESLEY: We're assuming they haven't already.
BUFFY: No. They know what she means  to us. She's too valuable, and as  long as we've got the box -- (a thought) The box. We trade.
WESLEY: We can't.
BUFFY: (to Giles) It's the best plan, it's the safest  way, right?
GILES: It might well be --
BUFFY: We call the Mayor, arrange a meeting.
WESLEY: This box must be destroyed.
XANDER: I need a volunteer to hit Wesley...
WESLEY: Giles, you know I'm right about this.
BUFFY: Wes, you want to duck and cover  at this point.
WESLEY: Dammit, you listen to me!
BUFFY: There is no other way.
WESLEY: You're the one who said take the  fight to the Mayor and you were  right. This is the town's best  hope of survival -- it's your  chance to get out!
BUFFY: You think I care about that? Are  you made of human parts?
GILES: All right, let's deal with this rationally --
BUFFY: I can't believe you're taking his side!
GILES: Nobody said I was taking his side!
ANGEL: None of this is helping.
XANDER: I'm still for the "let's hit Wesley"  movement, if anybody cares--
WESLEY: Listen to you people! You'd  sacrifice thousands of lives --  your families, your friends? It  can all end right here! We have  the means to destroy this box--
BUFFY: Giles, make the call.
GUARD: What are you doing?
WILLOW: Oh, um, just looking for a  sucking candy. My mouth gets  dry when I'm nervous, or held  prisoner against my will...
GUARD: Just a little taste.
MAYOR: Ever have a dog?
FAITH: What?
MAYOR: (rhapsodically) I did. Rusty. Irish setter. Swell  little pooch. A dog's friendship  is stronger than reason, stronger  than its own sense of self- preservation.
WILLOW: Whoa.
WILLOW: Faith!
FAITH: Anybody with brains, anybody  who knew what was going to  happen to her, would be trying to  claw her way out of this place.  But, you, you just can't stop  Nancy Drewing, can you?
WILLOW: Faith, I want to tell you something...
FAITH: Oh, yeah, please give me the  speech again: "Faith, we're still  your friends, we can help you,  it's not too late."
WILLOW: It's way too late.
FAITH: You try to hurt me, I try to hurt  you. I'm just a little more efficient.
WILLOW: And here I thought you just  didn't have a comeback.
FAITH: You're begging for some deep pain.
WILLOW: I'm not afraid of you.
FAITH: Let's see what we can do about that.
MAYOR: Faith, you know I don't like  repeating myself.
FAITH: (sotto, to Willow) I got someone. I got him.
MAYOR: I just received a heck of an  interesting phone call.
OZ: The place is locked down, except for the front.
XANDER: Gives me that comforting  'trapped' feeling.
BUFFY: One way out means one way in. I  wanna see them coming.
XANDER: I guess they're shy.
ANGEL: I can see all right.
MAYOR: Well, this is exciting, isn't it?  Clandestine meeting by dark of  night, exchange of prisoners, I  just, I feel like we should all be  wearing trench coats.
BUFFY: Let her go.
MAYOR: Not till the box is in my hands. (looking her over) So you're the little girl who's  been causing me all this trouble.  She's pretty, Angel. Little  skinny... Still don't understand  why it couldn't work out with  you and my Faith... Guess you  kinda just have strange taste in  women.
ANGEL: Yeah. I like 'em sane.
OZ: Angel, chill.
MAYOR: Well, I wish you kids the best, I  really do. But if you don't mind  a bit of fatherly advice, I, well  gosh I don't see much of a future  for you two. I don't sense a  lasting relationship, and not just  because I plan to kill the both of  you. You have a bumpy road ahead.
BUFFY: I don't think we need to talk  about this.
MAYOR: You kids, you don't like to think  about the future, don't like to  plan but unless you want Faith  to gut your friend like a seabass  you'll show a little respect for  your elders.
ANGEL: You're not my elder. I gotta lot  of years on you.
MAYOR: And that's just one of the things  you're gonna have to deal with.  You're immortal, she's not. It's  not easy. I married my Edna Mae  in aught three and I was with her  right until the end. Not a pretty  scene. Wrinkled and senile and  cursing me for my youth, it  wasn't our happiest time.
SNYDER: Nobody moves. I knew you kids  were up to something.
BUFFY: Snyder, get out of here.
SNYDER: You're not giving orders, young lady.
BUFFY: Wait.
FAITH: Boss?
MAYOR: Principal Snyder, I think we have  a problem...
SNYDER: Mr. Mayor, I... I had no idea you  were -- I'm terribly sorry.
MAYOR: It's I who should apologize,  coming here at night, what must you think...
WESLEY: Oh, God.
XANDER: Where did it go?
SNYDER: (to the security guards) Get that door open.
GILES: No! We can't let that thing out of here.
XANDER: I still want to know where it went...
BUFFY: Listen.
FAITH: Boss!
MAYOR: I wouldn't leave that open...
OZ: Is that all of them?
MAYOR: Not really. There's about fifty  billion of these happy little  critters in here. Would you like to see?
BUFFY: Snyder... you alive in there?
SNYDER: You... all of you... why couldn't  you be dealing drugs like normal  people?!?
WESLEY: (bitterly) Well, that went swimmingly.
BUFFY: (looking at Willow) We did all right.
WILLOW: So Faith is like, "I'm gonna beat  you up", and I'm all "I'm not  afraid of you", and then she had  the knife so that was less fun but  oh! I told her, "You made your  choice, Buffy was your friend..."
GILES: Yes, that's fascinating. But let's  get back to the point -- you  actually had your hands on the  Books of Ascension?
WILLOW: Volumes one through five.
GILES: Is there anything you can  remember that might be useful to us? Anything at all?
WILLOW: Well, I was in a hurry, and what  I did read was kind of involved.  If you ask me, it was way overwritten.
GILES: Oh.
WILLOW: There were a few pages that  looked interesting, but I didn't  have time to read them fully.
BUFFY: (to Will) This is your night for suave. You  should get captured more often.
WILLOW: No thank you.
WESLEY: Well, let's hope there's  something useful in them. The  Mayor has the Box of Gavrok.  As of now we're right back where we started. (to Buffy) Wouldn't you say?
WILLOW: Deep thoughts?
BUFFY: Deep and meaningful.
WILLOW: As in?
BUFFY: As in I'm never getting out of  here. I thought maybe if I stop  the Mayor... but... I'm kidding  myself. There's always gonna be  something. I'm a Sunnydale girl.  No other choice.
WILLOW: It must be tough. I mean, cause  here I am, I can do anything I  want, I can go to any college in  the country, and four or five in  Europe if I want.
BUFFY: (somewhat appalled) Please tell me you're going  somewhere with this.
WILLOW: Nope.
BUFFY: U.C. Sunnydale?
WILLOW: I will be matriculating with the  class of 2003.
BUFFY: Are you serious?
WILLOW: Say, isn't that where you're going?
BUFFY: I don't believe it!
WILLOW: What do you mean, I can't?
BUFFY: I won't let you.
WILLOW: Of the two people here, which is  the boss of me?
BUFFY: But there's better schools --
WILLOW: Sunnydale's not bad. And I can  design my own curriculum.
BUFFY: There's <b>safer</b> schools. There's  safer <b>prisons</b>. I can't let you stay  here because of me.
WILLOW: Actually, this isn't about you.  Although I'm fond, don't get me  wrong, of you. The other night,  getting captured and all, facing  off with Faith... things just got  kind of clear. I mean, you've  been fighting evil here for about  three years, and I've been helping  out some, and now we're  supposed to be deciding what we  wanna do with our lives and I  realized that's what I want to do.  Fight evil. Help people. I think  it's worth doing, and I don't  think you do it 'cause you have  to. It's a good fight, Buffy, and I want in.
BUFFY: I kind of love you.
WILLOW: Besides, I've got a shot at  becoming a bad ass wicca, and what better place to learn?
BUFFY: I feel the need for more sugar than  the human body can handle.
WILLOW: Mochas?
BUFFY: Yes please.
WILLOW: Neat, huh?
BUFFY: Sometimes it is.
MANAGER: Chase, what are you doing? Your  break's been over for ten minutes.  I still need you to restock the  shelves and sweep out the storage  room. Let's go!
BUFFY: It's gonna be fun. Will and I are  gonna go visit the campus  together on Saturday. I'm hoping  Mom'll let me live on campus --  it's too far to go home every  night, plus the lack of cool  factor... either way I'll be close to  your place...
ANGEL: Well, he's evil.
BUFFY: Big time. He doesn't know what  a lasting relationship is.
ANGEL: No.
BUFFY: Probably the only lasting  relationship he's ever had is  with... with Evil.
ANGEL: Yeah.
BUFFY: He sure doesn't know you...  stupid evil guy... We'll show him.
ANGEL: We will.
