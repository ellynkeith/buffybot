Sorry, honey!
There's something you don't see every day. (wearily) Unless, of course, you're me.
It's what I live for. Sad to say...
(to Angel) No, it's just... Don't you kinda  get the feeling we're in a rut?
You never take me any place new.
So this is our future? Is this how  we're going to spend our nights  when I'm fifty and you're... the  exact same age you are now?
Liking that plan.
Okay, busted. Didn't think you'd  miss them. Here's me taking them off.
Oh. Right. Wonderful.
You said that before.
Mom, you know I can't--
(turning back) You're proud of me?
More like a continent of denial.  She's got to realize I can't leave.  U.C. Sunnydale. At least I got in.
Faith's turn to the dark side of  the force has pretty much put the  proverbial kibosh on any away  school plans for me. But, you...  I can't believe you got into  Oxford!
That's where they make Gileses!
Making the open dumpster your cafeteria.
Remember to breathe between  insults, guys.
I don't think I can talk any  slower, Wes. I want to leave.
Not now -- after I graduate! College!
I'm also a person! You can't just  define me by my slayerness;  that's... somethingism.
I got into Northwestern.
I bet they have all that stuff in  Illinois.
I know it's complicated. I'm  aware that my graduation may  be, among other things,  posthumous. But what if I stop  the Ascension. What if I capture Faith?
I do that, then all you two have  to do is keep the run-of-the-mill  unholy forces at bay through  mid-terms. I'll be back here in  time for homecoming, and every  school break after that... Can we  at least think about it?
I'll make them different.
I'm sick of waiting for Mayor  McSleaze to make his move,  while we sit on our hands  counting down to Ascension  Day. For once, let's take the fight to them.
I gotta have a plan? Really? I  can't just be pro-active with pep?
I actually knew that. I thought  you meant a real specific plan,  you know, with maps and stuff.  So. Great. Find out what they're  up to.
(all cheerful and friendly-like) So, what's in the box?
The Box of Gavrok. It houses  some kind of great demonic  energy or something which His  Honor needs to chow down on  when A-Day rolls around.
The box is being kept under  guard in a conference room on  the top floor.
I figure best to hit it from the  roof. I'll take Angel with me.
Hop on the train or get off the tracks.
Looks like a job for Wiccan Girl.  What do you think, Wil? Big  time danger.
Let's get to work.
Four stars, Wil. Now take off.
Got it!
Like very much to come up now, please.
Don't suppose you want to help  get me down.
How did you -- you -- how did  this happen?
It's nobody's fault; we just gotta  focus and deal. Oz, I swear I  won't let them hurt her.
No. They know what she means  to us. She's too valuable, and as  long as we've got the box -- (a thought) The box. We trade.
(to Giles) It's the best plan, it's the safest  way, right?
We call the Mayor, arrange a meeting.
Wes, you want to duck and cover  at this point.
There is no other way.
You think I care about that? Are  you made of human parts?
I can't believe you're taking his side!
Giles, make the call.
One way out means one way in. I  wanna see them coming.
Let her go.
I don't think we need to talk  about this.
Snyder, get out of here.
Wait.
Listen.
Snyder... you alive in there?
(looking at Willow) We did all right.
(to Will) This is your night for suave. You  should get captured more often.
Deep and meaningful.
As in I'm never getting out of  here. I thought maybe if I stop  the Mayor... but... I'm kidding  myself. There's always gonna be  something. I'm a Sunnydale girl.  No other choice.
(somewhat appalled) Please tell me you're going  somewhere with this.
U.C. Sunnydale?
Are you serious?
I don't believe it!
I won't let you.
But there's better schools --
There's <b>safer</b> schools. There's  safer <b>prisons</b>. I can't let you stay  here because of me.
I kind of love you.
I feel the need for more sugar than  the human body can handle.
Yes please.
Sometimes it is.
It's gonna be fun. Will and I are  gonna go visit the campus  together on Saturday. I'm hoping  Mom'll let me live on campus --  it's too far to go home every  night, plus the lack of cool  factor... either way I'll be close to  your place...
Big time. He doesn't know what  a lasting relationship is.
Probably the only lasting  relationship he's ever had is  with... with Evil.
He sure doesn't know you...  stupid evil guy... We'll show him.
