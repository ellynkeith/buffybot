I don't understand.
What -- now?
But you're a Slayer.
All right, everyone: Monsters,  Demons, world in peril...
You cannot leave Sunnydale.  With the power invested in me  by the Council, I forbid it.
With Faith gone bad, and the  Mayor's Ascension coming up--
Perhaps if circumstances were different...
What?
No, no... Much too reckless.  We're at a distinct disadvantage.  We don't know enough--
What's that?
(taking charge) Well, now ... Here's what I think  we should--
Yes, fine. But you'll still need--
Hang on, we don't know what  such a ritual would require--
All right. Stop! I demand  everyone stop this instant.
The Mayor will most assuredly  have supernatural safeguards  protecting the box. Oh, we all  forgot about that.
Let's synchronize our watches. I  have exactly eleven six...
We're assuming they haven't already.
We can't.
This box must be destroyed.
Giles, you know I'm right about this.
Dammit, you listen to me!
You're the one who said take the  fight to the Mayor and you were  right. This is the town's best  hope of survival -- it's your  chance to get out!
Listen to you people! You'd  sacrifice thousands of lives --  your families, your friends? It  can all end right here! We have  the means to destroy this box--
Oh, God.
(bitterly) Well, that went swimmingly.
Well, let's hope there's  something useful in them. The  Mayor has the Box of Gavrok.  As of now we're right back where we started. (to Buffy) Wouldn't you say?
