Buffy.
What are we doing?
It's hard.
You have to go.
Lagos?
Be careful.
Buffy…
I don't know…
It's good you did.
I think I have what you're looking for.
The Glove of Myhnegon.
Don't. Once it's put on, the glove can  never be removed.
(in Latin) Exorere, Flamma Vitae. Prodi  ex loco tuo elementorum, in  hunc mundum vivorum.
(English Translation) Arise, Flame of Life. Come  forth from your place of the  elements, into this world of  the living.
What do you want?
What for?
Yes.
All right. I dug up some Cadlinroot,  get ready to throw it in.
In the trunk.
That hurt.
You're not getting that glove.
