Yo, what's up. (to Buffy) Time to motorvate.
New Olympic category.
Depends. Who the hell are you?
I'm telling you, I don't need a new  watcher! No offense, lady, I just have  this problem with authority figures.  They end up kinda dead.
Excuse me, Mary Poppins, you're  not listening…
Ronnie. Deadbeat. Steve. Klepto.  Kenny. DRUMMER. Eventually I  had to face up to my destiny as a loser  magnet. Now it's strictly get some  and get gone. You can't trust guys.
So. What about you?
Yeah, but you've gotta have stories.  I mean, I had my share of losers, but  you boinked the undead. So? What  was it like?
Try.
Sure, whatever. You know what?  We're 0 for 6 tonight. Let's blow  this off.
I'll swing through it, it's on my way  anyway.
I got Miss Priss on my back now, I  don't need another baby sitter. I'll  holler if I'm having any fun.
Later.
Son of a bitch… My lucky night.
It's open.
Yeah. The decorator just left. Cost  me a pretty penny - but a motif like  this don't come cheap.
Wild stab. Buncha guys from Spart?
Ya think?
Giles is okay.
What meeting?
I guess that doesn't include me.
Training, as in punching and kicking  and stabbing?
I'm your girl.
You look pissed.
Tell me about it.
Don't think I don't know what you and  your pals were talking about behind my  back today.
More about this glove deal than  you're saying.
The vampire.
Angel. Guy like that, with that kind of  glove… could kill a whole mess of people.
Buffy knew he was alive. I can't  believe her.
And I say we can't afford to find out.  I say I deal with this problem right now.  I say I slay.
Beauty.
You got it.
That I am.
What?
Gee, let me guess.
Yeah, I'm thinking. Thinking Buffy's  ex-meat did this.
The guy's a demon! How much more  proof do you need?
Screw this waiting crap.
Yeah - and he's gonna have a whole  lot of company, unless I do something  permanent.
For what? You to grow a pair? You  handle the baby-sit. I'm going to  kill Angel.
Mrs. Post…?
I can't believe how much I'm gonna  kill you.
Wanna bet?
What…?
Never stop a slayer when the blood is up.
You're confused, Twinkie. Let me  clear you up: (pointing) Vampire. Slayer. Dead vampire.
What's going on?
That I can.
Come in.
Yeah, real Spartan.
Five by five.
Yeah, well, you can't trust people.  I shoulda learned that by now.
Is that right?
<b>I'm</b> on my side. And that's enough.
So, is that it?
I'll see you, then.
Buffy?
Nothing.
