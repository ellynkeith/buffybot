BUFFY: Mom? What are you doing here?
JOYCE: I brought you a snack. I thought it  was about time I came out to watch, you know, the Slaying.
BUFFY: Mom, you know the Slaying, it's kind of an alone thing.
JOYCE: But it's such a big part of your life,  and I'd like to understand it. It's  something we could share.
BUFFY: It's really pretty dull. Bam boom stick poof. Not much to--
JOYCE: Good, Honey! Kill it!
JOYCE: Buffy! He's over there!
JOYCE: (stunned as she gets a good look at him) Oh my God. It's Mr. Sanderson from the bank!
JOYCE: Are you sure you have to kill him? He opened my IRA.
BUFFY: He's not Mr. Sanderson anymore, Mom, he's-
JOYCE: (cutting her off) Getting away!
BUFFY: Stay!
BUFFY: They said we can go home now.
JOYCE: They were little kids. Did you see them? So tiny.
BUFFY: I saw.
JOYCE: Who would do something like this?  I never--
BUFFY: I'm so sorry you saw this. But it's  going to be okay.
JOYCE: How?
BUFFY: I'll find whatever did it.
JOYCE: I guess. It's just, you can't, you can't  make it right.
BUFFY: It's okay. I'll take care of everything.  I promise, mom. Just...try to calm down.
BUFFY: (frantic) Don't tell me to calm down!
GILES: I only meant--
BUFFY: They were kids, Giles, Little kids.  You don't know what it was like to see them there. Mom's just... she  can't even talk.
GILES: I'm sorry, Buffy. I just want to help.
BUFFY: I know.
GILES: Do we know anything about how... it  wasn't the vampire --
BUFFY: There were no marks. Wait. I mean, there was a mark, a symbol.
GILES: (re: paper) Twelfth century Papal encyclical. Try this.
BUFFY: It was on their hands. The cops are keeping it quiet, but I got a good look at it.
BUFFY: Find the thing that uses this symbol  and point me at it.
GILES: Hmm.
BUFFY: Giles. Speak. What?
GILES: What? Oh. It's just, I wonder if we're looking for a "thing." The use of a symbol on a victim, it suggests ritual murder, an occult sacrifice by a group.
BUFFY: A group of... human beings. Someone with a soul did this?
GILES: I'm afraid so.
BUFFY: Okay. So while you're looking for  the meaning of the squiggly mark - maybe you could turn up a loophole on the "slayers don't kill people" rule.
GILES: Buffy, this is a dreadful crime. You  have every right to be upset. However, I wonder if you're letting  this become a shade more... personal because of your mother's involvement.
BUFFY: Oh, it's completely personal. So find me the people who did this. Please.
XANDER: Hey.
OZ: Hey.
XANDER: So. Burrito.
OZ: This is a burrito.
XANDER: Damn straight.
AMY: Oh, god, and Mr. Nyman, that thing he does with his face --
WILLOW: (excited) The thing with the face! When he makes a point, the -- I always think  he's going to sneeze!
AMY: I thought I was the only one who  saw it.
WILLOW: Hi Oz! Xander, hi.
OZ: Amy.
AMY: Hey guys.
OZ: (to Will) I haven't seen you around. Where've  you been?
XANDER: Not with me. No sir. Ask anyone. Nooo.
OZ: Hey, Buffy's birthday's next week.
XANDER: Oh! Yeah. Good. I've been pondering the gift options--
WILLOW: Shh. 
XANDER: Oh, come on. We just got a topic.
WILLOW: Hi Buffy.
OZ: Hey.
XANDER: So, Buff, what's up?
BUFFY: You guys didn't hear?
XANDER: Hear what?
BUFFY: A murder. Somebody killed two little kids.
WILLOW: Oh no!
BUFFY: Like, maybe seven or eight years old. My mom found the bodies during  patrol last night.
AMY: Oh my god.
OZ: Kids.
XANDER: Why was your mom there?
BUFFY: More bad. She picked last night, of all nights, for a surprise "bonding" visit.
WILLOW: God... Your mom would actually  take the time to do that with you? (off their looks) That's really not the point of the  story, is it?
BUFFY: No, the point is she's completely  wigging.
JOYCE: Who's wigging?
BUFFY: Uh, well, everyone. You know, 'cause of.... what happened.
JOYCE: It's so awful. I had bad dreams about it all night.
WILLOW: Hi, Mrs. Summers.
JOYCE: Hello everybody. (then) Buffy, did you talk to Mr. Giles yet about who could've done this?
BUFFY: (uncomfortable) Uh, yeah. He says it looks like something ritual, occult. He's still looking. We're going to add to my  patrols, keep a closer eye on things...
JOYCE: (appalled) Occult? Like witches? It's witches?
WILLOW: Sorry. Phlegm. Too much dairy.
JOYCE: Oh, I know you kids think that stuff is cool. Buffy told me you dabble...
WILLOW: Absolutely. That's me. I'm a dabbler.
JOYCE: But anybody who could do this isn't  cool. Anybody who could do this would have to be a monster.
BUFFY: Mom. Can I talk to you for a sec?
JOYCE: (as she's pulled away) Nice to see you kids...
XANDER: What a burn. Buff's mom was just  starting to accept the slayer thing. Now she's going to be double-freaked.
WILLOW: (glances at Amy) Makes me glad my mother doesn't know about my extra-curricular activities. (then/goes off) Or my curricular activities. Or, you know, the fact of my activeness in general...
JOYCE: Are your friends gonna help with the  investigation too?
BUFFY: Mom, this isn't really --
JOYCE: You're embarrassed to be seen hanging  out with your mother. (in her own defense) I didn't hug you...
BUFFY: No, it's just... this hall is about  school. You're about home. Mix  them and my world dissolves.
JOYCE: I know. You have no mother, you hatched full-grown out of a giant egg. It's just, I keep thinking about who could have done such a thing. I want to help.
BUFFY: Oh. Well, Giles can always use--
JOYCE: I called everyone I know in town. Told them about the dead children. They're all just as upset as I am.
BUFFY: You called everyone you know?
JOYCE: And they called all their friends. And guess what? We're setting up  a vigil tonight, at City Hall. The  Mayor's even going to be there.  Now we'll get some action.
BUFFY: Uh-huh. That's great. But, you know what? A lot of times, when you're working on something like this, you try to keep the number of people who know about it, kind of... small.
JOYCE: Oh. Right. Well, I'm sure it won't  be all that many people.
BUFFY: (to Willow) This is great. Maybe we can all go patrolling together later...
WILLOW: At least your mom's making an effort. My mom's probably (sees her) standing right in front of me this second. Mom?
ROSENBERG: Willow! I didn't know you were going to be her. Hello, Bunny.
BUFFY: Hi.
WILLOW: Mom -- what are you doing here?
ROSENBERG: Oh, I read about it in the paper and what with your dad out of town -- (stops, noticing) Willow, you cut off your hair! That's a new look.
WILLOW: Yeah, it's just a sudden whim that I  had... in August.
ROSENBERG: I like it. Hello, Joyce.
JOYCE: Sheila. I'm glad you could come.
GILES: There you are. I almost didn't find  you in this crush.
GILES: Mrs. -- Joyce. This is quite a turn out you've gotten here.
JOYCE: It wasn't just me. But, thank you. (then) Well - it's been a while.
GILES: Right. Not since, not since, not for a while.
ROSENBERG: There's a rumor going around,  Mr. Giles.
GILES: Rumor? About us? About what?
ROSENBERG: About witches. People calling themselves witches are responsible for this brutal crime.
GILES: Indeed? How strange.
WILLOW: Yes. So strange. Witches!
ROSENBERG: It's actually not that strange. I just  co-authored a paper on the rise of  mysticism among adolescents and I was shocked at the statistical -- ooh, are we starting?
JOYCE: (to Buffy) He'll do something about this. You'll see.
MAYOR: I want to thank you all for coming in the aftermath of such a tragic crime. Seeing you here proves what a caring community Sunnydale is. Sure, we've had our share of misfortunes - but we're a good town, with good people. And I know none of us will rest easy  until this horrible murder is solved. With that in mind...
MAYOR: I make these words my pledge to you. Never Again.
MAYOR: And now, I ask you to give your  attention to the woman who brought  us all here tonight, Joyce Summers.
JOYCE: Mr. Mayor, you're dead wrong.
JOYCE: This is not a good town. How many of us have lost someone who just... disappeared, or got skinned, or  suffered "neck rupture"?! And how many of us have been too afraid to  speak out? I was supposed to lead us  in a moment of silence. But silence  is this town's disease.
JOYCE: For too long, it's been plagued by unnatural evils. It's not our town  anymore. It belongs to the monsters, to the witches and Slayers.
JOYCE: I say - it's time for the grown ups to take Sunnydale back. I say - we start by finding the people who did this and making them pay.
MICHAEL: Watch it!
ROY: Oh, sorry. Did I make you smudge your eye-liner? Gonna put a spell on me?
AMY: (to Roy) Hey! What is your problem?
ROY: Everyone know he's into that voodoo  witch crap. I heard about those kids;  people like him gotta learn a lesson.
AMY: What about people like me?
ROY: Get in my face and you'll find out.
ROY: No problem here. We're walking.
BUFFY: (to Amy and Michael) You guys okay?
MICHAEL: We're fine.
AMY: Thanks, Buffy.
CORDELIA: You're gong to be one busy little Slayer, baby-sitting them.
BUFFY: I doubt they'll have more trouble.
CORDELIA: I doubt your doubt. Everyone know witches killed those kids. Amy is a  witch. And Michael is whatever the boy of "witch" is, plus being the  poster child for yuck.
BUFFY: Cordelia--
CORDELIA: If you're going to hang with them, expect badness, 'cause that's what you get for hanging with freaks and losers. Believe me, I know.
CORDELIA: That was a pointed comment about me hanging with you guys.
BUFFY: (calling after) I get that. But witches didn't do it!
GILES: Actually, I'm afraid they may have. My research keeps leading me back to  European Wiccan covens.
BUFFY: You found the meaning of the symbol?
GILES: Just about. I'm fairly sure a book that Willow borrowed has the rest of  the information I need.
XANDER: Buffy. Hi.
BUFFY: Hey. Is Willow around?
XANDER: How can I convince you people that it's over?! You assume because I'm  here, she's here, or that I somehow mysteriously know where she is.
BUFFY: Are those hers?
XANDER: Yeah. She's in the bathroom.
XANDER: But the fact that I know doesn't change that I have a genuine complaint here. I'm sick of the judgement. The innuendo. Is a man not innocent until proven guilty?!
BUFFY: Xander. You are guilty. You got illicit smoochies and you have to  pay the price.
XANDER: But I'm talking about future guilt. Everyone expects me to mess up again. Like Oz. I see the way he is around me. You know, that steely gaze...  The pointed silence...
XANDER: No. It's different now. It's a more verbal non-verbal. He says volumes  with his eyes.
WILLOW: Hey, Buff. What'cha looking for? You want to borrow something?
BUFFY: What's this?
WILLOW: (nervous) A doodle. I do doodle. You too. You do doodle too.
XANDER: (to Buffy) You're not going to make me feel better, are you?
BUFFY: (to Will/ignoring him) This is a witch symbol.
WILLOW: (caught) Okay. Yeah. It is.
BUFFY: (shocked) Willow.
WILLOW: What?
BUFFY: This symbol was on the murdered kids.
WILLOW: It was? On the kids... Oh no, Buffy. I didn't know. No one told  me about that. I swear--
XANDER: Oh, man. It's Nazi Germany and I have Playboys in my locker.
SNYDER: This is a glorious day for principals everywhere. No pathetic whining about "students' rights," just a long row of lockers and a man with a key.
OZ: They just took three kids away.
BUFFY: I don't get it. What are they  looking for?
AMY: Witch stuff.
WILLOW: What?
AMY: They found my spells. I'm supposed  to report to Snyder's office.
WILLOW: Oh my god.
AMY: Willow, be careful.
WILLOW: I have things. In my locker. Henbane, Hellibore, Mandrake root...
XANDER: Excuse me, Playboys. Can we work the sympathy thisaway?
CORDELIA: Get your grubby custodial hands off that! That hair spray cost forty- five dollars and it's imported!
WILLOW: The next one's mine. (then, frantic) Buffy, I didn't do anything wrong. The symbol's harmless. I used it to make a protection spell for you, for your birthday. With Michael and Amy. Only, now it's broken, because you know about it. So Happy Birthday, and please, you have to believe me.
SNYDER: (loudly) Ms. Rosenberg. My office.
BUFFY: Giles?
GILES: They're confiscating my books.
BUFFY: Giles, we need those books.
GILES: Believe me - I tried telling that to the nice man with the big gun.
BUFFY: There's something about this symbol  we're not getting. Willow used it in  a protection spell. She said it's  harmless - not a big bad. So why would it turn up in a ritual sacrifice?
GILES: I don't know. Ordinarily I'd suggest we widen our research...
BUFFY: Using what? The dictionary and "My  Friend Flicka"?
GILES: This is intolerable. Snyder has interfered before, but I will not take this from that twisted little homunculus -
SNYDER: Ah, I love the smell of desperate librarian in the morning.
GILES: Get out of here, and take your... marauders with you.
SNYDER: Oh my. So fierce. I suppose I should hear you out. Just how is (picking up a book) "Blood Rites and Sacrifices" appropriate material for a public school library? The Chess Club branching out?
GILES: These items are my personal research materials. I assure you - they're all  perfectly harmless.
GILES: They're antiques.
SNYDER: So are you. A relic of a progressive  era that is finally coming to an end. Welcome to the new new age.
GILES: This isn't over.
SNYDER: Oh, I'd say it's just beginning. Fight it if you want -- just remember:  lift a finger against me, and you'll  have to answer to MOO.
BUFFY: Answer to MOO? Did that sentence make some sense that I'm just not in on?
SNYDER: Mothers Opposed to the Occult. Powerful new group.
BUFFY: And who came up with that lame name?
SNYDER: That would be the founder. I believe  you call her 'mom'.
ROSENBERG: Sit down, honey.
WILLOW: Principal Snyder talked to you.
ROSENBERG: Yes. He's quite concerned.
WILLOW: Mom. I know what it looks like, but I can totally-
ROSENBERG: (cutting her off) You don't have to explain, honey. This isn't exactly a surprise.
WILLOW: Why not?
ROSENBERG: Identification with mythical icons is perfectly typical of your age group. It's a classic adolescent response to the pressure of incipient adulthood.
WILLOW: Oh. Is that what it is.
ROSENBERG: Of course, I could have wished that you would identify with something a little less icky, but developmentally  speaking --
WILLOW: Mom, I'm not an age group. I'm me. Willow group.
ROSENBERG: I understand --
WILLOW: No you don't. It's probably hard to  accept, but I can do stuff. Nothing bad or dangerous. But I can do spells-
ROSENBERG: You think you can. And that's what concerns me. The delusions-
WILLOW: Mom. How would you know what I can do? The last time we had a conversation  over three minutes it was about the  patriarchal bias of the Mr. Rodgers show.
ROSENBERG: Well, with "King Friday" lording it over all the lesser puppet --
WILLOW: Mom, you're not paying attention!
ROSENBERG: And this is your way of trying to get it. Now, I've consulted some of my colleagues and they all agree. This is a cry for discipline. You're  grounded.
WILLOW: Grounded? This is the first time -  ever - I do something you don't like and I'm grounded? I'm supposed to  mess up. I'm a teenager, remember?
ROSENBERG: (nods) You're upset. I hear your -
WILLOW: Hear this, Ma! I'm a rebel. I'm having a rebellion-
ROSENBERG: Willow. Honey. You don't have  to act out like this to prove your  specialness-
WILLOW: Mom! I'm not acting out - I'm a  WITCH. I make pencils float. I summon the four elements! Well -  two elements - but four soon! (then) And I'm dating a musician!
ROSENBERG: Willow!
WILLOW: I worship Beelzebub! I do his bidding. Do you see any goats  around? No! Because I sacrificed them! All bow before SATAN!
ROSENBERG: I'm not listening to this --
WILLOW: Prince of darkness - I summon you!  Come fill me with your black,  naughty evil!
ROSENBERG: That's enough!
ROSENBERG: Now. You will go to your room and  stay there until I say otherwise. (hard) And we're gonna make some changes. I don't want you hanging out with those friends of yours. It's clear where this little obsession came from. You will not speak to Bunny Summers again.
JOYCE: I don't want you seeing that Willow  anymore. I've spoken with her mother.  I had no idea her forays into the occult had gone so far.
BUFFY: You're the one who ordered the raid on the school today.
JOYCE: Honey, they opened a few lockers.
BUFFY: Lockers. First syllable, lock. They're supposed to be private. Also, they took all of Giles' books away.
JOYCE: He'll get most of them back. MOO  just wants to weed out the offensive material. Everything else will be returned to Mr. Giles soon.
BUFFY: But we need those books now. To help solve this thing.
JOYCE: Sweetie, those books had no business in a public school library. Especially  now. Any student could waltz in there  and get all sorts of ideas. Do you  understand how that terrifies me?
BUFFY: Mom, I hate that these people scared you so much. And I know you're  trying to help. But you have to let  me handle this. It's what I do.
JOYCE: But is it really? You patrol. You slay. Evil pops up, you undo it. And that's great. But has Sunnydale gotten any better? Are they running  out of vampires?
BUFFY: I don't think they run out--
JOYCE: It's not your fault. You don't have a plan. You just... react to things. It's bound to be kind of fruitless.
BUFFY: Okay. Maybe I don't have a plan. Lord knows I don't have lapel buttons...
JOYCE: Buffy--
BUFFY: ...And maybe the next time the world is getting sucked into hell, I won't  be able to stop it because, guess what, the anti-hell-sucking book isn't on the approved reading list!
JOYCE: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put down--
BUFFY: Yeah. You did. But you know what? I have to go. I have to go out on  one of my pointless little patrols now, and "react to" some vampires,  if that's all right with MOO.
BUFFY: And nice acronym, Mom.
JOYCE: I'm just trying to make things better.
GIRL: There's bad people out there.
BOY: And we can't sleep.
GIRL: Not until you hurt them...
BOY: The way they hurt us.
ANGEL: Hey...
BUFFY: Hey. How are you?
ANGEL: I'm all right. (looks at her) I think I'm better than you right now.
ANGEL: I heard about this. People are talking.  People are even talking to me.
BUFFY: It's strange... People die in Sunnydale all the time. And I've never seen anything like this.
ANGEL: They were children. Innocent. It makes a difference.
BUFFY: And Mr. Sanderson from the bank had it coming?
BUFFY: My mom... She said some stuff to me. About being the Slayer. That it's  fruitless. No fruit for Buffy.
ANGEL: She's wrong.
BUFFY: Was she? Is Sunnydale any better  than when I came here? Okay - so  I battle evil. But I don't really win -  the bad keeps coming back and  getting stronger. I'm like that kid  in the story, the boy who stuck his  finger in the duck.
ANGEL: Dike.  (off her confusion) It's another word for a dam.
BUFFY: Oh. Okay, now that story makes a  lot more sense.
ANGEL: Buffy, you know I'm still working things out; there's a lot I don't  understand. But I know it's important to keep fighting and I learned that from you.
BUFFY: But we never --
ANGEL: We never win.
BUFFY: Not completely.
ANGEL: We never will. That's not why we fight. We do it 'cause there's things  worth fighting for.
ANGEL: Those kids. Their parents.
BUFFY: Right. Their parents.
ANGEL: I know it's not much.
BUFFY: (deep in thought) No. It's a lot...
GILES: Session interrupted? Who said you could interrupt -- Stupid, useless fad -- That's right! I said fad! And I'll say it again.
XANDER: At that point I will become frightened.
OZ: Take heart. We found your books.
XANDER: Put the heart back. We can't get 'em. They're locked in City Hall.
XANDER: "Frisky Watcher's Chat Room."  Why, Giles...
XANDER: Buffy! Oz and I found out --
BUFFY: These kids. What do we know  about them?
GILES: What?
BUFFY: Facts. Details.
XANDER: Well... they were found in the park --
BUFFY: Where'd they go to school? Who are  their parents? What are their names?
BUFFY: We know everything about their deaths, but we don't even know  their names.
XANDER: Sure we do... uh... it's on the tip  of my tongue...
OZ: It's never come up. Ever.
BUFFY: And if no one know who they are,  how did they get these pictures?
GILES: I - I assumed that someone knew the  details. I never really...it's very strange.
BUFFY: (points to the computer) We need to get some information.
GILES: Could somebody else... This thing has  shut me out.
XANDER: Well if you didn't yell at it...
OZ: I can look around, but Willow really  knows the sites we'll need.
BUFFY: How - she's not even allowed to come  to the phone. The wrath of MOO.
OZ: We don't need a phone.
OZ: Okay. We're linked. If anyone's  ID'd the kids, she'll pull it up and  feed it here.
GILES: Two children, found dead. Mysterious  mark... No. These children were  found near Omaha in 1949,
XANDER: They aren't ours. Keep going.
BUFFY: Wait.
WILLOW: Those are...
BUFFY: The same kids.
GILES: Fifty years ago.
OZ: 1899. Utah... Two children... rural community torn apart by suspicion...
GILES: A hundred years. How is that possible?
OZ: No mention of who they were.
BUFFY: They've never been seen alive, just dead. A lot.
GILES: Let me see that.
GILES: From as far back as 1649.
GILES: Written by a cleric from a village near the Black Forest. He found  the bodies himself. Two children... Greta Strauss, age six. Hans  Strauss, eight.
XANDER: So they have names. That's new.
ROSENBERG: You're not minding me, Willow. I thought I made myself clear.
WILLOW: Mom -
ROSENBERG: I see what you're doing. You're  challenging me. But I will not have  you communicating with your cyber- coven or what have you-
WILLOW: Coven? What happened to me being  "delusional" and "acting out?"
ROSENBERG: That was before I talked in depth with Ms. Summers and her associates. It seems I've been rather closed-minded.
WILLOW: So - you believe me?
ROSENBERG: I believe you, dear. (then) Now all I can do is let you go  with love.
WILLOW: Let me go? What does that mean?
WILLOW: (perplexed) Mom?
OZ: We lost Willow.
GILES: Greta Strauss. Hans Strauss.
GILES: There's a fringe theory held by a few  folklorists that some regional stories  have actual, very literal antecedents...
BUFFY: And in some language that's English?
OZ: (still typing) Fairy tales are real.
BUFFY: Hans and Greta. (light bulb) Hansel and Gretel.
XANDER: Wait. Hansel and Gretel? Breadcrumbs,  ovens, Gingerbread house?
GILES: Of course... it makes sense now...
BUFFY: Yeah, it's all falling into place.  Of course, that place is nowhere  near this place...
GILES: There are demons that thrive on  fostering persecution and hatred among the mortal animals. Not on  destroying men, but on watching them destroy each other. They feed us our darkest fear, and turn peaceful communities into vigilantes.
BUFFY: Hansel and Gretel go home and tell on the mean old witch --
GILES: And she and probably dozens of other  are punished by a righteous mob. It's happened throughout history. It happened in Salem, not surprisingly.
XANDER: I'm still spinning on the whole fairy tales are real thing.
OZ: What do we do?
XANDER: I don't know about you, but I'm going  to go trade my cow for some beans. (off their looks) No one else is seeing the funny here?
BUFFY: Giles, we have to talk to Mom. If  she know the truth she can defuse this whole thing --
XANDER: What happened?
MICHAEL: I was attacked.
XANDER: Officially not funny.
BUFFY: By who?
MICHAEL: Dad. His friends. They're taking people from their homes. And something about a trial at city hall... They got Amy.
OZ: Willow.
MICHAEL: Tell her to get out of her house.
BUFFY: Michael, stay here and hide. Giles, we'll go find my mom. Oz, you and  Xander --
OZ: We're already gone.
WILLOW: Mom. We really need to-
ROSENBERG: It's time to go. (mom-like) Get your coat. It's chilly out.
WILLOW: Go? Go where-
ROSENBERG: (harder again) I said - get your coat, witch.
JOYCE: Buffy. Mr. Giles? Has something happened?
BUFFY: Oh. Um. Mom? Can we talk to you?
JOYCE: Of course, Honey. (to her guests) You go on without me.
BUFFY: (to Joyce) Mom, we have to talk alone. There's  more going on than you --
JOYCE: You were right. That was easy.
GIRL: I told you.
BOY: It gets even easier.
GIRL: But I'm still scared of the bad girls.
BOY: You have to stop them. You have to make them go away. Forever.
ROSENBERG: (to Willow) Stand still. Be a good girl.
WILLOW: No! Why are you doing this to me? Mom?
ROSENBERG: There's no cure but the fire.
AMY: Buffy! Wake up!
WILLOW: Mom, this is crazy!
AMY: Buffy!
GILES: Cordelia?
CORDELIA: Took you long enough to wake up.  My hand hurts.
GILES: Pity... Why are you here?
CORDELIA: Things are way out of control, Giles.  First the thing at school, and then my mom confiscates all my black clothes and scented candles. I came over to tell Buffy to stop this craziness and I found you all unconscious again. How many times have you been knocked out, anyway? I swear, one of these times you're  going to wake up in a coma.
GILES: Wake up in-- Never mind. We have to go save Buffy from Hansel and Gretel.
CORDELIA: Now let's be clear, the brain damage happened before I hit you.
XANDER: What's with the grim? We're here  to join you guys.
XANDER: Really. Why should you guys have  all the fun? We want to be part of  the hate.
OZ: Just so we're clear - you know you're nuts, right?
WILLOW: Buffy!
JOYCE: Good morning, sleepy-head.
BUFFY: (still groggy) You don't want this.
JOYCE: Since when does it matter what I  want? I wanted a normal, happy daughter and instead I got a slayer.
ROSENBERG: (to Joyce/pleasantly) Torch?
JOYCE: Thanks. (then) This has been so trying -- but you've  been a champ.
ROSENBERG: You too, Joyce.
JOYCE: We should stay close. Have lunch.
ROSENBERG: How nice. I'd love to.
AMY: Oh, you can't be serious...
BUFFY: Mom, don't!
AMY: All right! You want to fry a witch!? I'll give you a witch!
AMY: "Goddess Hecate, work thy will..."
BUFFY: Uh oh.
AMY: "Before thee let the unclean thing craw!"
BUFFY: She couldn't do us first?
WILLOW: Do not dare! You see what we can do -- another step and you will all  feel my power!
BUFFY: (sotto voce) What are you gonna do, float a pencil at 'em?
WILLOW: It's a really big power...
BUFFY: (getting into it) That's right! You will all be turned into vermin... and some of you will be fish... the people in the back will be fish...
MOOSTER: Maybe we should go...
BOY: But you promised...
GIRL: You have to kill the bad girls.
CORDELIA: I can't believe you had this stuff in your apartment. It smells foul.
GILES: Shred the Wolfsbane -- that's the  leafy stuff. Then crush the Satyrion root. (to himself) Luften sie den something. Schumer?  Shluter?
CORDELIA: God. This is killing my manicure. What are you muttering about?
GILES: It's part of an incantation I'm trying  to recall. It's in German and without my books...
CORDELIA: What's it mean?
GILES: It's about lifting a veil. It should  make the demons appear in their true form, which should negate their influence. Oh, and you need to drop a toadstone into the mixture.
CORDELIA: This? It doesn't look like a toad.
GILES: No reason it should. It's from inside the toad.
CORDELIA: I hate you.
GIRL: They hurt us.
BOY: Burn them.
BUFFY: Mom, dead people are talking to you. Do the math!
JOYCE: I'm sorry, Buffy
BUFFY: Mom! Look at me. You love me.  If you do this, you won't be able to  live with yourself.
JOYCE: You earned this. You toyed with unnatural forces... Buffy, what kind of mother would I be if I didn't punish you?
CORDELIA: Ow! You got hair with that!
CORDELIA: God, you really were the little youthful offender, weren't you? You must look back and just cringe.
OZ: We have to get inside.
WILLOW: No! Oh, God! Help!
OZ: Will.
XANDER: It sounds like she's right... above us?
WILLOW: Buffy... it's too hot. I can't take it.
BUFFY: I'm so sorry, Willow. If it wasn't  for me, you never would...
GILES: (shouting in German) Dämonen zeight euch. Ich beschwöre die Mächte der Hecate, Königin und Beschützerin der Hexen, die Masken wegzureissen. Das Böse soll das Gesicht des Bösen tragen... (English) Demons show yourselves. I call on the powers of Hecate, queen and protectress of witches, to strip away the masks. Let evil wear an evil face... 
JOYCE: Stop them!
WILLOW: Buffy! I'm on fire!
BUFFY: Cordelia, put out the fire!
GILES: Hecate ruft euch an. Hebt den Schleier auf. (Hecate implores you. Lift the veil)
GILES: Hebt den Schleier auf. Verbergt euch nicht hinter falschen Gesichtern. (Lift the veil. Hide not behind false faces.)
CORDELIA: Okay. I liked the two little ones better than the one big one.
DEMON: Protect us! Kill the bad girls!
BUFFY: You know what? Not as convincing in that outfit.
JOYCE: Oh my god, Buffy!
BUFFY: Did I get it? Did I get it?
OZ: We're here to save you.
BUFFY: Your mom doesn't mind us doing this in the house?
WILLOW: She doesn't know.
BUFFY: (sympathetically) Business as usual?
WILLOW: Sort of. She's doing that selective memory thing your mom used to be  so good at.
BUFFY: She forgot everything?
WILLOW: No, she remembered the part where I told her I was dating a musician. Oz  has to come for dinner. So that's  sort of like taking an interest...
BUFFY: So. You want to try this again?
WILLOW: Let's do it. I think we got the mix  of herbs right this time.
WILLOW: "Diana! Hecate! I hereby license  thee to depart. Goddess of creatures  great and small - I conjure thee to withdraw!"
BUFFY: Maybe we should get her one of those  wheel things.
