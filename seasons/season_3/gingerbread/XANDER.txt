Hey.
So. Burrito.
Damn straight.
Not with me. No sir. Ask anyone. Nooo.
Oh! Yeah. Good. I've been pondering the gift options--
Oh, come on. We just got a topic.
So, Buff, what's up?
Hear what?
Why was your mom there?
What a burn. Buff's mom was just  starting to accept the slayer thing. Now she's going to be double-freaked.
Buffy. Hi.
How can I convince you people that it's over?! You assume because I'm  here, she's here, or that I somehow mysteriously know where she is.
Yeah. She's in the bathroom.
But the fact that I know doesn't change that I have a genuine complaint here. I'm sick of the judgement. The innuendo. Is a man not innocent until proven guilty?!
But I'm talking about future guilt. Everyone expects me to mess up again. Like Oz. I see the way he is around me. You know, that steely gaze...  The pointed silence...
No. It's different now. It's a more verbal non-verbal. He says volumes  with his eyes.
(to Buffy) You're not going to make me feel better, are you?
Oh, man. It's Nazi Germany and I have Playboys in my locker.
Excuse me, Playboys. Can we work the sympathy thisaway?
At that point I will become frightened.
Put the heart back. We can't get 'em. They're locked in City Hall.
"Frisky Watcher's Chat Room."  Why, Giles...
Buffy! Oz and I found out --
Well... they were found in the park --
Sure we do... uh... it's on the tip  of my tongue...
Well if you didn't yell at it...
They aren't ours. Keep going.
So they have names. That's new.
Wait. Hansel and Gretel? Breadcrumbs,  ovens, Gingerbread house?
I'm still spinning on the whole fairy tales are real thing.
I don't know about you, but I'm going  to go trade my cow for some beans. (off their looks) No one else is seeing the funny here?
What happened?
Officially not funny.
What's with the grim? We're here  to join you guys.
Really. Why should you guys have  all the fun? We want to be part of  the hate.
It sounds like she's right... above us?
