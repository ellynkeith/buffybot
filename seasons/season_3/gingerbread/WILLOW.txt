(excited) The thing with the face! When he makes a point, the -- I always think  he's going to sneeze!
Hi Oz! Xander, hi.
Shh. 
Hi Buffy.
Oh no!
God... Your mom would actually  take the time to do that with you? (off their looks) That's really not the point of the  story, is it?
Hi, Mrs. Summers.
Sorry. Phlegm. Too much dairy.
Absolutely. That's me. I'm a dabbler.
(glances at Amy) Makes me glad my mother doesn't know about my extra-curricular activities. (then/goes off) Or my curricular activities. Or, you know, the fact of my activeness in general...
At least your mom's making an effort. My mom's probably (sees her) standing right in front of me this second. Mom?
Mom -- what are you doing here?
Yeah, it's just a sudden whim that I  had... in August.
Yes. So strange. Witches!
Hey, Buff. What'cha looking for? You want to borrow something?
(nervous) A doodle. I do doodle. You too. You do doodle too.
(caught) Okay. Yeah. It is.
What?
It was? On the kids... Oh no, Buffy. I didn't know. No one told  me about that. I swear--
What?
Oh my god.
I have things. In my locker. Henbane, Hellibore, Mandrake root...
The next one's mine. (then, frantic) Buffy, I didn't do anything wrong. The symbol's harmless. I used it to make a protection spell for you, for your birthday. With Michael and Amy. Only, now it's broken, because you know about it. So Happy Birthday, and please, you have to believe me.
Principal Snyder talked to you.
Mom. I know what it looks like, but I can totally-
Why not?
Oh. Is that what it is.
Mom, I'm not an age group. I'm me. Willow group.
No you don't. It's probably hard to  accept, but I can do stuff. Nothing bad or dangerous. But I can do spells-
Mom. How would you know what I can do? The last time we had a conversation  over three minutes it was about the  patriarchal bias of the Mr. Rodgers show.
Mom, you're not paying attention!
Grounded? This is the first time -  ever - I do something you don't like and I'm grounded? I'm supposed to  mess up. I'm a teenager, remember?
Hear this, Ma! I'm a rebel. I'm having a rebellion-
Mom! I'm not acting out - I'm a  WITCH. I make pencils float. I summon the four elements! Well -  two elements - but four soon! (then) And I'm dating a musician!
I worship Beelzebub! I do his bidding. Do you see any goats  around? No! Because I sacrificed them! All bow before SATAN!
Prince of darkness - I summon you!  Come fill me with your black,  naughty evil!
Those are...
Mom -
Coven? What happened to me being  "delusional" and "acting out?"
So - you believe me?
Let me go? What does that mean?
(perplexed) Mom?
Mom. We really need to-
Go? Go where-
No! Why are you doing this to me? Mom?
Mom, this is crazy!
Buffy!
Do not dare! You see what we can do -- another step and you will all  feel my power!
It's a really big power...
No! Oh, God! Help!
Buffy... it's too hot. I can't take it.
Buffy! I'm on fire!
She doesn't know.
Sort of. She's doing that selective memory thing your mom used to be  so good at.
No, she remembered the part where I told her I was dating a musician. Oz  has to come for dinner. So that's  sort of like taking an interest...
Let's do it. I think we got the mix  of herbs right this time.
"Diana! Hecate! I hereby license  thee to depart. Goddess of creatures  great and small - I conjure thee to withdraw!"
