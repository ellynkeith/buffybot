I brought you a snack. I thought it  was about time I came out to watch, you know, the Slaying.
But it's such a big part of your life,  and I'd like to understand it. It's  something we could share.
Good, Honey! Kill it!
Buffy! He's over there!
(stunned as she gets a good look at him) Oh my God. It's Mr. Sanderson from the bank!
Are you sure you have to kill him? He opened my IRA.
(cutting her off) Getting away!
They were little kids. Did you see them? So tiny.
Who would do something like this?  I never--
How?
I guess. It's just, you can't, you can't  make it right.
Who's wigging?
It's so awful. I had bad dreams about it all night.
Hello everybody. (then) Buffy, did you talk to Mr. Giles yet about who could've done this?
(appalled) Occult? Like witches? It's witches?
Oh, I know you kids think that stuff is cool. Buffy told me you dabble...
But anybody who could do this isn't  cool. Anybody who could do this would have to be a monster.
(as she's pulled away) Nice to see you kids...
Are your friends gonna help with the  investigation too?
You're embarrassed to be seen hanging  out with your mother. (in her own defense) I didn't hug you...
I know. You have no mother, you hatched full-grown out of a giant egg. It's just, I keep thinking about who could have done such a thing. I want to help.
I called everyone I know in town. Told them about the dead children. They're all just as upset as I am.
And they called all their friends. And guess what? We're setting up  a vigil tonight, at City Hall. The  Mayor's even going to be there.  Now we'll get some action.
Oh. Right. Well, I'm sure it won't  be all that many people.
Sheila. I'm glad you could come.
It wasn't just me. But, thank you. (then) Well - it's been a while.
(to Buffy) He'll do something about this. You'll see.
Mr. Mayor, you're dead wrong.
This is not a good town. How many of us have lost someone who just... disappeared, or got skinned, or  suffered "neck rupture"?! And how many of us have been too afraid to  speak out? I was supposed to lead us  in a moment of silence. But silence  is this town's disease.
For too long, it's been plagued by unnatural evils. It's not our town  anymore. It belongs to the monsters, to the witches and Slayers.
I say - it's time for the grown ups to take Sunnydale back. I say - we start by finding the people who did this and making them pay.
I don't want you seeing that Willow  anymore. I've spoken with her mother.  I had no idea her forays into the occult had gone so far.
Honey, they opened a few lockers.
He'll get most of them back. MOO  just wants to weed out the offensive material. Everything else will be returned to Mr. Giles soon.
Sweetie, those books had no business in a public school library. Especially  now. Any student could waltz in there  and get all sorts of ideas. Do you  understand how that terrifies me?
But is it really? You patrol. You slay. Evil pops up, you undo it. And that's great. But has Sunnydale gotten any better? Are they running  out of vampires?
It's not your fault. You don't have a plan. You just... react to things. It's bound to be kind of fruitless.
Buffy--
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put down--
I'm just trying to make things better.
Buffy. Mr. Giles? Has something happened?
Of course, Honey. (to her guests) You go on without me.
You were right. That was easy.
Good morning, sleepy-head.
Since when does it matter what I  want? I wanted a normal, happy daughter and instead I got a slayer.
Thanks. (then) This has been so trying -- but you've  been a champ.
We should stay close. Have lunch.
I'm sorry, Buffy
You earned this. You toyed with unnatural forces... Buffy, what kind of mother would I be if I didn't punish you?
Stop them!
Oh my god, Buffy!
