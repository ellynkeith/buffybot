Hey.
This is a burrito.
Amy.
(to Will) I haven't seen you around. Where've  you been?
Hey, Buffy's birthday's next week.
Hey.
Kids.
They just took three kids away.
Take heart. We found your books.
It's never come up. Ever.
I can look around, but Willow really  knows the sites we'll need.
We don't need a phone.
Okay. We're linked. If anyone's  ID'd the kids, she'll pull it up and  feed it here.
1899. Utah... Two children... rural community torn apart by suspicion...
No mention of who they were.
We lost Willow.
(still typing) Fairy tales are real.
What do we do?
Willow.
We're already gone.
Just so we're clear - you know you're nuts, right?
We have to get inside.
Will.
We're here to save you.
