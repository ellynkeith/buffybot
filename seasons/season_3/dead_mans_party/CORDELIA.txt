(struggling) Hello? This would be dust time!
(mild surprise) Oh. Buffy. Hey-
Okay - were you, like, living in a box or what?
Yeah, but our outfits suck. That Rambo thing is so over. I'm thinking sporty. Hilfiger, maybe.
You wish.
Nice pet, Giles. Don't you like anything  regular? Golf or USA Today or anything?
I'm the dip!
What? Onion dip. Stirring. Not cooking.  That's what I bring.
What's the difference?
I know. It smells like Giles' cat.
Totally. (to Xander) Except - you were kinda turning me on with that whole "boy slayer" look.
You bet - "Nighthawk..."
Time out, Xand. I mean, put yourself in Buffy's shoes for a minute. I'm Buffy - freak of nature - right? Naturally,  I pick a freak for a boyfriend...  Then he's Mister Killing Spree, which  is pretty much my fault, and --
I'm just trying to help. If you haven't  noticed, Buffy, people aren't exactly  lining up to give you props-
How do we know it's really you and not zombie Giles?
That's him.
Mask? They're here to exfoliate?
Worse than a Zombie.
