(enthusiastic) Still - we're getting good. I mean, we dust, like, 9 out of 10!
(with equal enthusiasm) 6 out of 10!
Tomorrow? I...
Okay. I had some school stuff, but... I guess I can change my plans.
Hey - what about Buffy's Welcome home dinner tonight? I told her mom we'd help out. Bring stuff.
Xander-
Buffy did say she wanted to loosen up. Have some kid time. (to Oz) Hey. Aren't you guys rehearsing tonight? Why don't you play at the party.
All the more reason to make her feel welcome. And a big party says, Welcome Buffy!
Hey!
You like?
Sorry - what!?
What? This isn't avoiding. See? Here you are. Here I am.
Way. That's why - with the party. 'Cause we're all glad you're back.
Okay. Good.
You're leaving again? What, you just stopped by to pick up your lint brush and now you're ready to go?
Oh, no, go ahead. Have a great time, don't forget to not write.
Wow, and it looks so much like giving up!
For who?
We did the best we could! We didn't have much choice in the matter.
Well, I'd like to.
Maybe I don't need to understand. Maybe I just need you to talk to me.
This isn't easy, Buffy. I know you're  going through stuff but so am I.
I don't just mean that. I mean my life. I have all sorts of -- I'm dating,  I'm having serious dating... with a  werewolf, and I've been studying  witchcraft and killing vampires, and  you were my best friend, I didn't have  anyone to talk to about all this scary  life stuff. Then you come back and you  didn't even ask about me. You just  worried about whether I was mad at you.
She was running away again.
Buffy, you never --
Let them go, Oz. Talking about it isn't helping; we might as well try some violence!
I was being sarcastic!
Buffy! Heads up!
He just keeps coming!
She's...
I mean I'm not like a full fledged witch,  that takes years. I just did a couple of  pagan blessings and teeny glamour to  hide a zit.
It has. I tried to communicate with the spirit world and I so wasn't ready for that. It was like being pulled apart inside. Plus I blew the power for our whole block. Big scare.
Me too. I really freaked out.
It's okay. Really, I understand you having to bail and I can forgive that.  I have to make allowances for what  you're going through and just be a  grown up about it.
It's like a drug.
All right, I'll stop giving you a hard time. (beat) Runaway.
I'm sorry. (beat) Quitter.
Bailer.
Delinquent.
