Would you show me your hands, please?
Your hands.
I think they could be cleaner.
After every meal, and under the fingernails. Dirt gets trapped  there. And germs. And mayonnaise.
My dear mother said that cleanliness was next to godliness and I believed her. She never caught a cold. (closing the folder) I'd like these two to be put under surveillance. And I'd like to know  if any other colorful characters have come to town.
You have all my faith.
Hello. It's nice to meet you.
In my office. I'm Richard Wilkins, I'm the Mayor of Sunnydale. And you're Mr. Trick. Please sit down.
That's an exciting suit.
As I understand it you're not a man exactly. Mr. Trick, I've been mayor for quite some time. I like things to run smoothly. You see, this is a very important year for me.
(smiling) Something like that.
Do you have children?
Children are the heart of a community. They have to be looked after. Controlled. The more rebellious element needs to be dealt with.
The children are our future. We need them. I need them.
So I've heard. Very enterprising idea of yours, SlayerFest. That's the kind of initiative I need on my team.
Oh no, that won't be an issue. You and I are going to get along very well.
