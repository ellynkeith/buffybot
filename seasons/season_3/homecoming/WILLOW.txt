That sounds like fun.
And it is our last Homecoming dance, maybe we should make a big deal.
A private limo... (links her arm through Oz's) ...it is pretty...cuddlesome. (to Buffy) If we all split the cost...
Why wouldn't you? You bought your tickets already. I mean unless you didn't have a da -- (almost says date) -- ay or two to think it over. We should all think it over.
You have to help me pick an outfit. I want to wear something that'll make Oz go "ooh".
Where's Buffy? She's going to miss the yearbook pictures.
What do you think of this?
It's my first big dance, you know, where there's a boy and a band and not just me alone in my room  pretending there's a boy and a band, so I want it to be...
I thought you borrowed it from your cousin Rigby.
What do you think of this?
I was just... remember the eighth grade cotillion? You had that clip-on...
And now here we are, it's Homecoming.
That is none of your business, Alexander Harris.
You don't know that, what about you and Cordelia?
Since when did you become a --
-- gentleman.
I know. "Nice".
Really? (he nods) You, too. In a guy way.
So is Cordelia -- in a girl way.
I don't know if I can dance in this. (thinks) I don't know if I can dance...
Yeah, it shouldn't be a... (they get even closer) ...problem.
No. I mean it did but it didn't.
I wouldn't ever, either. It's the clothes. It's a fluke.
Not ever.
Right now!
Me, either!
Didn't Cordelia tell you?
But they were killed by zombies.
Uh... it's... just about done.
(to Buffy) It's just... she needs it so much more than you do.
Oh hi. How are you? You good? You look good. And what else is new with you? Did I mention you look --
No, I'm not a friend, I'm a rabid dog who should be shot, but there are forces at work here, dark incompressible forces...
(tiny voice) What do you want?
(tinier voice) 'Kay.
This is just --
-- the worst thing that's ever happened.
I'm talking about Buffy and Cordelia.
What are we gonna do? We have to do something. This is all our fault.
Because, we felt so guilty about the fluke we went overboard helping Cordelia -- and spun the whole group dynamic out of orbit -- we're a  meteor storm heading for earth!
Sometimes when you're falling apart your mouth does the sweetest thing.
What are we gonna do?
I'm talking about us.
(verge of tears) He wrote this song for me.
I'm scared, too.
We did one fine thing.
They're gonna announce the Queen, where are they? What's taking them so long?
