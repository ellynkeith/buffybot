BUFFY: Well.
ANGEL: Well.
BUFFY: That was... well it was very artistic.
ANGEL: Yeah...
BUFFY: Not quite what I'd expected... I'd never  actually seen - well from the title I  thought it was about food.
ANGEL: There was food...
BUFFY: (remembering) Right. The scene with the... food. Do  you feel like getting some hot  chocolate? Or some cold shower?
ANGEL: I'm sorry. I wanted to take you out  somewhere fun. It's been awhile since I've been to the movies. They've changed.
BUFFY: Little scary. (Angel nods) And a little not, which is also scary.
ANGEL: Buffy, you don't have to worry about me.
BUFFY: I just don't like to rub your nose in it.  (perplexed) Suddenly wondering where that phrase  comes from...
ANGEL: (smiling) I don't need to see movies to get  worked up. Just being around you does  that just fine. It doesn't mean I'm  gonna lose control. Or that I'm only  frustrated around you. It feels nice just  to feel.
BUFFY: It doesn't drive you crazy? Even when  we're... close?
ANGEL: Watch this.
FAITH: Check out the lust-bunnies.
BUFFY: Patrol?
ANGEL: The council has you back on active duty?
FAITH: Finally. (to Buffy) They want us down by Mercer.
BUFFY: Okay. (to Angel) G'night...
ANGEL: I'll see you soon.
FAITH: (to Angel) Don't worry, big guy. Just keeping her  warm for you.
FAITH: Gotta tell you, B., with the willpower  thing - nice job.
BUFFY: Thanks, and... huh?
FAITH: The close but no cigar deal with Angel.  I don't know if I could handle, you  know, the way you're... not handling it?
BUFFY: Faith, when it comes to Angel, do me a favor?
SKYLER: Ow! What are you, nuts? Going around  punching people.
BUFFY: People?
SKYLER: So, what, I'm a demon that makes it  okay?
FAITH: Talk fast. My partner's crazy. Don't  know how long I can hold her back.
SKYLER: How'd you like to get your hands on  the Books of Ascension?
BUFFY: Never heard of 'em.
SKYLER: Books of Ascension. Very powerful  works, and I am not talking about the prose. (more) They deal with some dark stuff, and the  Mayor would hate it if someone got  ahold of them before he... you know.
BUFFY: No, I don't know. Before the Mayor what?
SKYLER: Hey, read 'em and weep. That's all I  got to say. Tomorrow I get the books.  Meet me here. If the price is right, I  give the Books to you.
BUFFY: I'm not looking to trade with a demon.
SKYLER: And if this were still a barter economy,  that would be a problem. I want cash,  princess. Five large, for the whole set.
FAITH: So you can buy... and I'm guessing  here, skin care products?
SKYLER: Plane ticket out of the Hellmouth before  it's adios, Slayer Loco. So. Five Gs.  What do you say?
FAITH: I think "Die, fiend" kind of sums it up. (to Buffy) Wouldn't you say?
BUFFY: Let him walk. I don't think he falls in  the 'deadly threat to humanity'  category.
FAITH: Demon's a demon.
BUFFY: I wouldn't mind knowing about this  Ascension thing. Anything that can pin  the Mayor down would be cool.
FAITH: Yeah. It'd be cool.
MAYOR: And what exactly did this demon look like?
FAITH: Demonic.
MAYOR: And you say he has the Books of  Ascension, or will soon, and he was  willing to... sell them?
FAITH: That's what I said.
MAYOR: Hmm. You know what I wish? I wish  that you would pull your hair back.
FAITH: Yeah, sure, whatever. It's just a matter  of time before this demon guy spills.  Then Buffy and the Super Friends are  gonna...
MAYOR: You worry too much for a girl your age.  That's unnecessary stress. Luckily, I  have just the thing.
FAITH: And if Buffy gets to him first?
MAYOR: Oh. Well, frankly, I don't like to think  about that. I like good, positive, "up"  thoughts. If you failed me in that way...
FAITH: I don't do milk.
MAYOR: No? Oh. I know what you want.
WESLEY: And you say this demon wanted cash?  That's very unusual.
GILES: Demons after money. Whatever  happened to the still-beating heart of a virgin? No one has standards anymore...
BUFFY: He said the books were worth the price.
XANDER: So what's this Ascension mean?
GILES: I'm not sure...
WESLEY: Not really a common term in  demonology...
WILLOW: Ooh! Ooh! The Merenshtadt Text! I  think the section on genocide has  something about ascension.
BUFFY: Wow. We have a winner.
XANDER: (re: Watchers) And more importantly, two losers.
GILES: Where did you find that volume?
WILLOW: In the top of your book cabinet, with  the stuff you try to keep hidden.
XANDER: Hidden? Any engravings I should know  about? Frolicking nymphs of some  kind?
WILLOW: No, just magic secrets Giles doesn't  think I'm ready for.
BUFFY: Anything?
GILES: Yes, quite. There's reference here to the  journal of Desmond Kane, pastor of a  town called Sharpsville. "May 26th,  1723. Tomorrow is the ascension. God  help us all." That was last anyone  heard.
WESLEY: Of Kane?
GILES: Of Sharpsville. The town more or less  disappeared, it seems.
BUFFY: So, ascension possibly not a love-in.
GILES: I think you'll want to meet with this  demon, Buffy.
BUFFY: Yeah. Anybody got five thousand  dollars?
CORDELIA: (to Wesley) Can I ask something important?
XANDER: Cordelia? Important? Let's starts  calculating those odds, people.
CORDELIA: (to Wesley) What are you doing Friday night?
WESLEY: As always, my sacred duty as Watcher  prevents me from... why?
CORDELIA: I have to write a paper. For English.  And you're English, so I thought...
XANDER: And on the day the words "flimsy  excuse," were redefined, we stood in  awe, and watched.
WESLEY: Right. Books of Ascension. Mayor.  Slaughter. Bad. Tell you what: Why  don't we try to find this demon sooner  rather than later. Perhaps persuade him  to lend us his books free of charge.
BUFFY: I think Faith might be useful in the  persuading part.
WESLEY: I imagine so. Where is Faith, anyway?
SKYLER: Hey! Slayer! I wasn't expecting  company, give me a minute and I'll  have the place tidied up for...
FAITH: You got the books?
SKYLER: Depends. You got my money?
FAITH: Books of Ascension?
SKYLER: Original editions and everything. Great  condition: A little worn on the spine,  slight foxing, otherwise perfect.
FAITH: I don't like to haggle.
ANGEL: Faith.
FAITH: Angel. (beat) I got nowhere else to go.
ANGEL: It's okay.
FAITH: Nah, it's... a couple of county lines  over from okay, believe me.
ANGEL: I believe you.
FAITH: Mind if I skip past the "Mom never  loved me" part and get right to it? I'm  scaring myself.
ANGEL: I know the feeling.
FAITH: That's why I came to you. I don't want  to get all twelve-steppy, but remember,  you told me that killing people'd make  me feel like some kind of God?
ANGEL: Faith. You need help. And you can't do it alone.
FAITH: I know. For real now, I'm scared.  Scared of what I am, what I'm turning  into. Cold blooded, straight-up killer.  Like you.
ANGEL: No. You're not like me. I didn't have  the choice.
FAITH: Hey, believe me. I don't want to end up  the way everybody said I would - dead  or alone or a loser.
ANGEL: You don't have to.
FAITH: But, I don't know, maybe it's too late for me.
ANGEL: It's not.
FAITH: Angel I'm so scared...
ANGEL: Whoa. Faith, no. I can be here for you...
FAITH: Buffy. Yeah. I didn't mean it like that.  Maybe I did, but I wouldn't press it. I  got my flaws, I'm aware, but... that  ain't one of them.
ANGEL: I love her.
FAITH: Good for you. She's my friend too, you  know. Might not have guessed it just  now, but it's true. The two of you -  you're lucky. We friends?
ANGEL: We're friends.
FAITH: Then I'm lucky, too. I better go.
ANGEL: Where?
FAITH: I need to cool down, spend some time  alone. Don't worry about me. You've  been a big help. Just knowing someone cares...
ANGEL: We'll never know.
FAITH: Right. How could we?
ANGEL: Take care of yourself.
FAITH: Lifetime of practice.
MAYOR: There's no need to convince me. I'm  sure you gave it your level best. I just  don't understand what that boy could  be thinking.
FAITH: Try Buffy Summers. Like in the big fat  one-track way.
MAYOR: Don't be discouraged. You're a bright,  young, energetic girl with a whole life  ahead of her and I won't tolerate  brooding. So you couldn't give him  one moment of true happiness.
FAITH: I was thinking more along the lines of a  long weekend, but okay.
MAYOR: And he spurned your advances. So be  it. There's more than one way to skin a  cat, and I happen to know that's  factually true. We want to take Angel's  soul away.
WESLEY: Find anything?
GILES: A six course banquet of nothing. With a  scoop of sod all as a palette cleanser.
WESLEY: I've had no better luck. There must be something about this Ascension  somewhere.
GILES: Perhaps I should contact the Council,  run a search through the main branch -
WESLEY: No, I don't - It should be I that... The  council isn't entirely aware that I'm  letting you work for me. (off his look) With me. I don't think they'd be very  happy with the idea of the two of us  collaborating.
GILES: I'm not about to burst into glorious  song about it myself. But why don't  you give them a call.
WESLEY: I think the most expedient plan -
BUFFY: I'll go back to the scene, see if I can  track him.
WESLEY: Wait for Faith.
BUFFY: That could be hours. The girl makes  Godot look punctual. I'll just -
WESLEY: Buffy, this is a job that requires the  both of you. This demon could be  anywhere, and if these books are as  important as he says he has good reason  to hide. Finding him is going to be  extremely difficult.
XANDER: Found your demon.
BUFFY: Fashion tip, Wes? The mouth looks  better closed.
XANDER: Got the address. Beat it out of Willy  the Snitch personally.
BUFFY: You beat up Willy?
XANDER: Sure. Well, actually, let's just say I  applied some pressure. Or, more  accurately, that I asked politely. And  then, okay, I bribed him.
BUFFY: How much?
XANDER: Twenty-eight bucks. (to Giles) Does the Council reimburse for that stuff?
GILES: Did you get a receipt?
XANDER: Damn.
BUFFY: I know this. It's down by the bus  station. Not the nicest part of town.
GILES: Again, you see? No standards. Any self- respecting demon should be living in a  pit of filth or a nice crypt.
BUFFY: I'll be sure to mention that.
FAITH: Where are we going, girlfriend?
BUFFY: (slips her arm out) Think I can handle this one solo.
FAITH: Why should you get all the fun? Share  share, that's fair.
BUFFY: Right. We found our demon.
FAITH: Oh. Well, let's go look him up.
XANDER: Is it me, or did it just get really cold in here?
BUFFY: Faith. Careful.
FAITH: Right.
BUFFY: Missed you last night.
FAITH: Yeah, well, I was uh, patrolling. No  shortage of scum you gotta watch in  Sunnydale, right?
BUFFY: So I've heard. Hold up.
FAITH: Bettin' they got the Books, too. Some hit.
BUFFY: This wasn't just a hit. This was  someone's idea of a party.
FAITH: Maybe the guy put up a fight.
BUFFY: Could be...
FAITH: We gotta get gone. Come on. Nothing  we can do here now.
MAYOR: Mint?
SHAMAN: You have risked great danger in calling  on me. The deadliest Magicks are  needed to rob this creature of its soul.
MAYOR: Big job, all right.
SHAMAN: And so it shall be done.
MAYOR: That's just swell. Say, sure you don't, uh...
WILLOW: Are you okay?
BUFFY: Huh? Yeah. I can't stop thinking about  that demon.
WILLOW: 'Cause of him being chopped up into  little bits and all?
BUFFY: Yeah, Will, let's keeping bringing up visuals.
WILLOW: Are you sure that's all?
BUFFY: It really was plenty...
WILLOW: Yeah, but you seem a little on edge  lately. Is anything...
BUFFY: It's nothing.
WILOW: What about her?
BUFFY: It's just... I went to Angel's last night  and Faith was there. They seemed kind  of... intimate.
WILLOW: No way. I know what you're thinking  and no way.
BUFFY: You're right. Faith wouldn't do that.
WILLOW: Faith would totally do that! Faith was  built to do that! She's the do that girl!
BUFFY: (almost hyperventilating) Uh, comfort, remember to comfort...
WILLOW: Please! Does Angel come up to Faith's  standards for a guy? Let's see... is he breathing?
BUFFY: Actually, no.
WILLOW: Wow, she doesn't even have that  standard. But Buffy: Angel. There's no  way he'd do that. You're the only thing  in the world to him.
BUFFY: Sometimes I wonder... I guess he and  Faith have a lot in common. There's so  much he doesn't tell me.
WILLOW: Oh, but it's so clear. The way he feels...  Buffy, I too know the love of a taciturn  man. You gotta look at their actions.
BUFFY: I was.
WILLOW: Well, what did he say?
BUFFY: (sheepishly) Say? You mean when I  straightforwardly asked him what was  going on?
WILLOW: So ya bailed?
BUFFY: I just couldn't deal... not right there,  what if...
WILLOW: Enough. Stop with the crazy, go talk to Angel.
BUFFY: But I -
WILLOW: Go! I give you leave to go.
BUFFY: Thanks.
ANGEL: Faith.
FAITH: Hey. Sorry to bust in uninvited.
ANGEL: What do you want?
FAITH: Look, I'm not so good at apologies.  Mostly 'cause I think the world's out to  screw me, so I'm generally more owed  than owing, you know?
ANGEL: All right.
FAITH: No, it's not all right. Yeah, I was  freaked, and needed somebody, but  you're with Buffy. I should  know better.
ANGEL: Okay.
FAITH: You don't trust me.
ANGEL: It's not that.
FAITH: Hey, no problem. Join the club.
ANGEL: Faith. I know what you're going  through. And how hard it can be. It's  important to have someone who's been  where you are, who understands what  you're going through.
FAITH: Chump.
SHAMAN: (Arabic; transliterated) Yaa shayTann, inna nafsak Laa tatba'uk ba'd. Yaa Rufukayl al-'aZim, shattit Nafsah fii anHaa'I 'I- 'aalam al-arba'a. (English) Demon, your soul no longer belongs to you, Mighty Rofocale, scatter his soul to the four corners of the world.
ANGEL: Faith... !
FAITH: I wanted to do this the old-fashioned  way, but hey. Your loss. Luckily, I got  some tricks Buffy don't know yet.
ANGEL: You don't have to do this.
FAITH: I know, but it's fun. Relax. It'll be over soon.
ANGEL: No...
SHAMAN: (Arabic; transliterated) Yaa ruuh idhhabii! Yaa Nafs idhhabii! Utrukii Ayyaah wa-'trukiih MaHruuman wa-najisan! (English) Spirit, depart! Soul depart! Leave this one and leave him bereft and unclean!
ANGEL: Thanks so much.
FAITH: I've got my reasons.
ANGEL: Let me guess. You summoned back the true Angelus 'cause... you need a  new Boy Toy? Sorry. Doesn't work that way.
FAITH: You want to be smart? You listen to me.
ANGEL: Funny thing about vampires, Faith. We  don't establish meaningful dialogues  with Slayers.
FAITH: Not how Buffy tells it.
ANGEL: (laughing) Should have known you'd like it on top.
FAITH: You wanna listen or you wanna die?
ANGEL: Long as you're there, I mostly want you  to wriggle. But I'm listening.
FAITH: Last time you got like this, Buffy  kicked your ass all the way back to Hell. Want to do better this  time?
ANGEL: Very.
FAITH: Then get ready to meet the new boss.
WESLEY: Our enemy has us at a disadvantage. We  seem consistently to be one step behind  him. Now he has the Books of  Ascension. We need to take definitive  action.
CORDELIA: You have the greatest voice. Have you  ever though about doing books on tape?
XANDER: Way to focus, CC.
WESLEY: Yes, let's, let's stay on track. We'll  need everyone working together here.  Where is Angel?
BUFFY: I don't know. I went to the Mansion, he  wasn't there.
WESLEY: And Faith?
BUFFY: She's missing too.
WILLOW: (Pointedly, to Buffy) Which means nothing. Two  unconnected events.
BUFFY: What do we do?
GILES: Buffy, I think you should try to retrieve  the Books of Ascension. Try the  Mayor's office, but be damned careful.  Don't confront the Mayor; we don't  know a thing about him.
BUFFY: I'll go home and stock up on weapons.  Slip into something break-and-enterish.
CORDELIA: Excuse me, I believe Wesley is running  this meeting.
WESLEY: That's quite all right. Willow?
WILLOW: It's all bad news. By the time I got  through the encryptions the files were  empty. He musta seen me coming.
OZ: What about the Hall of Records? Go to  the source.
WESLEY: Good idea. There must be information  on the Mayor there.
GILES: Wesley, why don't you take the group  there and start looking.
WESLEY: Right.
CORDELIA: I'm in Wesley's group!
GILES: There's just the one group.
CORDELIA: Yes, and I'm in it.
XANDER: Anyone mind if I skip the trip? I'd  rather cruise town, keep my ear to the  ground. And I think five's a crowd.
CORDELIA: It really is.
GILES: Anyone finds out anything, they check  in with me.
OZ: I'll drive.
WILLOW: (proudly, to Oz) They all liked your plan.
GILES: Be careful.
FAITH: So? Can I keep him?
MAYOR: Let's just take things step-by step for  the moment. Now then. Angelus. May I  call you "Angel?"
ANGEL: Actually, I was thinking more along the  lines of you calling me "Master."
MAYOR: You know, Angelus, "attitude" may get  you attention, but courtesy wins  respect. I am the one responsible for  your new attitude.
ANGEL: That's why I'm here.
MAYOR: No trouble with the transition? No side effects?
ANGEL: (shrugs) Had a soul, now I'm free.
MAYOR: That's terrific. Poetic, too. Not that I  read much poetry. Except those little  ones in Reader's Digest. Some are quite catchy.
ANGEL: Hey I don't mean to rush things here,  but are you getting to anything like a point?
MAYOR: Kids today. Rush, rush, rush. The  point, Angel, is that you're a powerful  young man. Good for Faith. And there just may be a future for you here in Sunnydale. (beat) I see you're admiring my letter-opener.
ANGEL: Actually, I was thinking of stabbing  you through the heart with it.
MAYOR: Please do.
ANGEL: (re: Wet Wipe) Can't be killed, but you don't like germs?
MAYOR: (shivers) Eeugh, awful things. Unsanitary. But my question is, now that Faith has  brought you back, what are your  intentions?
ANGEL: Well, gee sir, I thought I'd find that  Slayer who's giving you so much  trouble and torture, maim,  and kill her.
MAYOR: Fine! Nice to hear you're not one of  those "slacker" types running around  today. Torture Buffy. Killing her's fine,  but make it a slow one.
ANGEL: My favorite kind.
MAYOR: Wonderful. We don't want a  replacement Slayer anytime soon. They  can't all turn out like my girl Faith.  Have fun!
FAITH: Let's do it.
MAYOR: Try to have her home by eleven.
XANDER: (Cordy-esque) "I love you when you talk, Wesley, I  love when you sing, Wesley, can you  say the word 'jailbait,' Wesley?" Limey bastard... (stops) Hey - Guys!
ANGEL: (deadpan) That guy just bugs me.
JOYCE: Faith. Angel.
ANGEL: Hi Joyce. Nice to see you. Buffy home?
JOYCE: Upstairs. And please tell me it's not  some vampire thing.
ANGEL: Only vampire here's me, Joyce. Say.  You... change your hair?
JOYCE: Highlights.
ANGEL: Nice.
FAITH: Knock knock.
BUFFY: Where've you guys been?
ANGEL: Looking for you. Good thing we found  you before you left.
FAITH: We got the Books.
ANGEL: They're at the Mansion.
FAITH: We'd take 'em to Giles ourselves, but I  think strength in numbers is the way to  go. Come on.
ANGEL: I can take those for you.
JOYCE: Sure you don't need a sweater?
BUFFY: Mom.
ANGEL: Don't worry, Joyce. We'll have her back  before you know it.
BUFFY: Okay. Let's get the books somewhere  safe. Where you keeping them?
ANGEL: Actually, there's been a slight change in  plan, Buf.
BUFFY: "Buf?" Did you just call me... Angel,  what's the matter with you?
ANGEL: Nothing. Matter of fact...
BUFFY: Angel?!?
ANGEL: You know, I never properly thanked  you. For sending me to Hell.
BUFFY: No...
ANGEL: Yeah. And I'm just wondering. Where do I start? A card? Fruit basket? Evisceration?
BUFFY: Angel...
ANGEL: I know what you're thinking. Maybe  there's still some good, deep down  inside of me, that still remembers, and  loves you, if only you could reach me.  Then again... we have reality.
BUFFY: I'll kill you before I let you touch me.
FAITH: Speak for yourself, B. Me? I like it here.
ANGEL: One thing I learned about Buffy...
CORDELIA: Hey! I know a way to make  investigating the Mayor even more  boring.
OZ: Hey.
WILLOW: Whoa. Big hey whoa. Guys. Check this out.
OZ: How about "like exact same guy like  exact same guy"?
WESLEY: Mayor Wilkins is over one hundred  years old. He's not human.
WILLOW: Xander! What happened to you?
XANDER: You know how some people hate to say  "I told you so?" (shakes his head) Not me. I told you so. Angel is back.  In the really bad sense. And I told you so.
WESLEY: Angelus has turned? Xander this is  terribly serious. Are you sure?
XANDER: Gee, let me think. Kinda hard to tell,  the last thing I saw was his fist.
WESLEY: We must contact Giles immediately.
XANDER: Good thinking! Let's waste time with a  lively debate, leave Buffy alone and see  how dead she gets!
CORDELIA: Slow down, Xander. This isn't  Wesley's fault.
XANDER: Actually, it is.  (to Wesley) Faith was your responsibility. And  guess who's Angel's new playmate.
WILLOW: Faith and Angel - together?
XANDER: Imagine the possibilities.
BUFFY: Angel?
ANGEL: Morning, sleepyhead. You know what I  just can't believe? All our time  together, and we never tried chains.
FAITH: Bondage looks good on you, B. The  outfit's all wrong, but hey.
BUFFY: Faith, you don't know what you're doing.
FAITH: Really? Weird. 'Cause something about  all this just feels so right. Maybe it's one of those unhappy  childhood things.
BUFFY: Faith, listen very closely. Angel is a  killer. When he's done with me, he'll  turn on you.
ANGEL: She's right, I probably will.
FAITH: Yeah? Huh. Guess we'll just have to  keep you around awhile, then.
BUFFY: Why, Faith? What's in it for you?
FAITH: What isn't? You know, I come to  Sunnydale, I'm a Slayer, I do my job  kicking ass better than anyone, and  what do I hear about, everywhere I go?
BUFFY: That's not my fault.
FAITH: Everybody asks, "why can't you be  more like Buffy," but did anyone ever  ask if you could be more like me?
ANGEL: I know I didn't.
FAITH: You get the Watcher, you get the mom,  you get your little Scooby Gang, what  do I get? Jack squat! This was supposed  to be my town!
BUFFY: Faith. Listen to me...
FAITH: Why? So you can impart some special  Buffy wisdom? That it? You think  you're better than me? Do you? Say it!  You think you're better than me!
BUFFY: I am.
FAITH: Uh... maybe you didn't notice - Angel's  with me.
BUFFY: And how'd you get him, Faith? Magic?  You cast some kind of spell, because in  the real world, Angel would never touch  you, and you know it.
FAITH: Uh-uh - you're just trying to make me  mad so I'll kill you - but I'm too smart  for that. Stick around.
FAITH: You can't.
BUFFY: I will.
FAITH: Keep dreaming. No one can stop the  Ascension! Mayor's got it wired, B. He  built this town for the demons to feed  on and come Graduation day, he's  getting paid. I'll be sitting at his right  hand - assuming he has hands after the  transformation, I'm not too clear on that  - and all your lame ass friends'll be  kibbles and bits. Think about that while  your boyfriend's cutting into you.
BUFFY: I never knew you had so much rage in you.
FAITH: What can I say? I'm the world's best actor.
ANGEL: Second best.
BUFFY: (to Angel) Graduation day. Think she left anything out?
ANGEL: I think we know everything she knows.
BUFFY: (to Faith) Can I say one thing? (drops her chains) Psyche.
FAITH: You played me? You played me?!?
XANDER: Buffy - Faith's bad!
FAITH: Yeah, and you're annoying.
WILLOW: Are you all right?
SHAMAN: The task is finished.
GILES: Yes. Thank you for coming to me. And for that rather effective light show  you put on.
SHAMAN: This restores the balance between us,  Rupert Giles. My debt to you is repaid  now in full. Do not call upon me again.
GILES: I shan't. Peace with you.
SHAMAN: And with you.
WILLOW: (awed) His debt to you is repaid? What did you do?
GILES: I introduced him to his wife.
WESLEY: Well I for one protest. You pitted  Slayer against Slayer in a dangerous  charade that could have gotten both  killed. Without informing me. (petulant) I'm telling the Council.
GILES: Yes, I think you should. We have a  rogue slayer on our hands. I can't think  of anything more dangerous.
BUFFY: At least now we know...
GILES: And we know a little more about the Ascension.
WILLOW: Graduation Day... That's a big scary un- fun, but at least Angel's not bad. And  that's good, right?
XANDER: Yes, I feel so much better knowing he  broke my face in the "good" way. It's a  "good" bruise!
BUFFY: (quietly to herself) He was only acting, Xander.
MAYOR: From where I'm sitting, it's batting  average that counts. So, you lost some friends.
FAITH: Wouldn't exactly call them friends.
MAYOR: So then what are you worried about?  Chin up. You don't see me looking  disappointed, do you? Heck no. Know why?
ANGEL: How you doing?
BUFFY: Been better.
ANGEL: Not hard to believe. You were a real  soldier last night, Buffy.
BUFFY: That's me. Just one of the troops.
ANGEL: I know how hard it was for you.
BUFFY: I doubt that.
ANGEL: If there's anything I can do to make it better...
BUFFY: Angel. I know you only did what I  asked you to. And we got what we  wanted.
ANGEL: I never wanted it to go that far.
BUFFY: I know. It's not even a question. But  after all that... I just need a little break.
ANGEL: You still my girl?
BUFFY: Always.
