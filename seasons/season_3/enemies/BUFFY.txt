Well.
That was... well it was very artistic.
Not quite what I'd expected... I'd never  actually seen - well from the title I  thought it was about food.
(remembering) Right. The scene with the... food. Do  you feel like getting some hot  chocolate? Or some cold shower?
Little scary. (Angel nods) And a little not, which is also scary.
I just don't like to rub your nose in it.  (perplexed) Suddenly wondering where that phrase  comes from...
It doesn't drive you crazy? Even when  we're... close?
Patrol?
Okay. (to Angel) G'night...
Thanks, and... huh?
Faith, when it comes to Angel, do me a favor?
People?
Never heard of 'em.
No, I don't know. Before the Mayor what?
I'm not looking to trade with a demon.
Let him walk. I don't think he falls in  the 'deadly threat to humanity'  category.
I wouldn't mind knowing about this  Ascension thing. Anything that can pin  the Mayor down would be cool.
He said the books were worth the price.
Wow. We have a winner.
Anything?
So, ascension possibly not a love-in.
Yeah. Anybody got five thousand  dollars?
I think Faith might be useful in the  persuading part.
I'll go back to the scene, see if I can  track him.
That could be hours. The girl makes  Godot look punctual. I'll just -
Fashion tip, Wes? The mouth looks  better closed.
You beat up Willy?
How much?
I know this. It's down by the bus  station. Not the nicest part of town.
I'll be sure to mention that.
(slips her arm out) Think I can handle this one solo.
Right. We found our demon.
Faith. Careful.
Missed you last night.
So I've heard. Hold up.
This wasn't just a hit. This was  someone's idea of a party.
Could be...
Huh? Yeah. I can't stop thinking about  that demon.
Yeah, Will, let's keeping bringing up visuals.
It really was plenty...
It's nothing.
It's just... I went to Angel's last night  and Faith was there. They seemed kind  of... intimate.
You're right. Faith wouldn't do that.
(almost hyperventilating) Uh, comfort, remember to comfort...
Actually, no.
Sometimes I wonder... I guess he and  Faith have a lot in common. There's so  much he doesn't tell me.
I was.
(sheepishly) Say? You mean when I  straightforwardly asked him what was  going on?
I just couldn't deal... not right there,  what if...
But I -
Thanks.
I don't know. I went to the Mansion, he  wasn't there.
She's missing too.
What do we do?
I'll go home and stock up on weapons.  Slip into something break-and-enterish.
Where've you guys been?
Mom.
Okay. Let's get the books somewhere  safe. Where you keeping them?
"Buf?" Did you just call me... Angel,  what's the matter with you?
Angel?!?
No...
Angel...
I'll kill you before I let you touch me.
Angel?
Faith, you don't know what you're doing.
Faith, listen very closely. Angel is a  killer. When he's done with me, he'll  turn on you.
Why, Faith? What's in it for you?
That's not my fault.
Faith. Listen to me...
I am.
And how'd you get him, Faith? Magic?  You cast some kind of spell, because in  the real world, Angel would never touch  you, and you know it.
I will.
I never knew you had so much rage in you.
(to Angel) Graduation day. Think she left anything out?
(to Faith) Can I say one thing? (drops her chains) Psyche.
At least now we know...
(quietly to herself) He was only acting, Xander.
Been better.
That's me. Just one of the troops.
I doubt that.
Angel. I know you only did what I  asked you to. And we got what we  wanted.
I know. It's not even a question. But  after all that... I just need a little break.
Always.
