Well.
Yeah...
There was food...
I'm sorry. I wanted to take you out  somewhere fun. It's been awhile since I've been to the movies. They've changed.
Buffy, you don't have to worry about me.
(smiling) I don't need to see movies to get  worked up. Just being around you does  that just fine. It doesn't mean I'm  gonna lose control. Or that I'm only  frustrated around you. It feels nice just  to feel.
Watch this.
The council has you back on active duty?
I'll see you soon.
Faith.
It's okay.
I believe you.
I know the feeling.
Faith. You need help. And you can't do it alone.
No. You're not like me. I didn't have  the choice.
You don't have to.
It's not.
Whoa. Faith, no. I can be here for you...
I love her.
We're friends.
Where?
We'll never know.
Take care of yourself.
Faith.
What do you want?
All right.
Okay.
It's not that.
Faith. I know what you're going  through. And how hard it can be. It's  important to have someone who's been  where you are, who understands what  you're going through.
Faith... !
You don't have to do this.
No...
Thanks so much.
Let me guess. You summoned back the true Angelus 'cause... you need a  new Boy Toy? Sorry. Doesn't work that way.
Funny thing about vampires, Faith. We  don't establish meaningful dialogues  with Slayers.
(laughing) Should have known you'd like it on top.
Long as you're there, I mostly want you  to wriggle. But I'm listening.
Very.
Actually, I was thinking more along the  lines of you calling me "Master."
That's why I'm here.
(shrugs) Had a soul, now I'm free.
Hey I don't mean to rush things here,  but are you getting to anything like a point?
Actually, I was thinking of stabbing  you through the heart with it.
(re: Wet Wipe) Can't be killed, but you don't like germs?
Well, gee sir, I thought I'd find that  Slayer who's giving you so much  trouble and torture, maim,  and kill her.
My favorite kind.
(deadpan) That guy just bugs me.
Hi Joyce. Nice to see you. Buffy home?
Only vampire here's me, Joyce. Say.  You... change your hair?
Nice.
Looking for you. Good thing we found  you before you left.
They're at the Mansion.
I can take those for you.
Don't worry, Joyce. We'll have her back  before you know it.
Actually, there's been a slight change in  plan, Buf.
Nothing. Matter of fact...
You know, I never properly thanked  you. For sending me to Hell.
Yeah. And I'm just wondering. Where do I start? A card? Fruit basket? Evisceration?
I know what you're thinking. Maybe  there's still some good, deep down  inside of me, that still remembers, and  loves you, if only you could reach me.  Then again... we have reality.
One thing I learned about Buffy...
Morning, sleepyhead. You know what I  just can't believe? All our time  together, and we never tried chains.
She's right, I probably will.
I know I didn't.
Second best.
I think we know everything she knows.
How you doing?
Not hard to believe. You were a real  soldier last night, Buffy.
I know how hard it was for you.
If there's anything I can do to make it better...
I never wanted it to go that far.
You still my girl?
