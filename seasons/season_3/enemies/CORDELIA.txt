(to Wesley) Can I ask something important?
(to Wesley) What are you doing Friday night?
I have to write a paper. For English.  And you're English, so I thought...
You have the greatest voice. Have you  ever though about doing books on tape?
Excuse me, I believe Wesley is running  this meeting.
I'm in Wesley's group!
Yes, and I'm in it.
It really is.
Hey! I know a way to make  investigating the Mayor even more  boring.
Slow down, Xander. This isn't  Wesley's fault.
