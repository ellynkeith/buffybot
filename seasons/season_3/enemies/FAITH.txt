Check out the lust-bunnies.
Finally. (to Buffy) They want us down by Mercer.
(to Angel) Don't worry, big guy. Just keeping her  warm for you.
Gotta tell you, B., with the willpower  thing - nice job.
The close but no cigar deal with Angel.  I don't know if I could handle, you  know, the way you're... not handling it?
Talk fast. My partner's crazy. Don't  know how long I can hold her back.
So you can buy... and I'm guessing  here, skin care products?
I think "Die, fiend" kind of sums it up. (to Buffy) Wouldn't you say?
Demon's a demon.
Yeah. It'd be cool.
Demonic.
That's what I said.
Yeah, sure, whatever. It's just a matter  of time before this demon guy spills.  Then Buffy and the Super Friends are  gonna...
And if Buffy gets to him first?
I don't do milk.
You got the books?
Books of Ascension?
I don't like to haggle.
Angel. (beat) I got nowhere else to go.
Nah, it's... a couple of county lines  over from okay, believe me.
Mind if I skip past the "Mom never  loved me" part and get right to it? I'm  scaring myself.
That's why I came to you. I don't want  to get all twelve-steppy, but remember,  you told me that killing people'd make  me feel like some kind of God?
I know. For real now, I'm scared.  Scared of what I am, what I'm turning  into. Cold blooded, straight-up killer.  Like you.
Hey, believe me. I don't want to end up  the way everybody said I would - dead  or alone or a loser.
But, I don't know, maybe it's too late for me.
Angel I'm so scared...
Buffy. Yeah. I didn't mean it like that.  Maybe I did, but I wouldn't press it. I  got my flaws, I'm aware, but... that  ain't one of them.
Good for you. She's my friend too, you  know. Might not have guessed it just  now, but it's true. The two of you -  you're lucky. We friends?
Then I'm lucky, too. I better go.
I need to cool down, spend some time  alone. Don't worry about me. You've  been a big help. Just knowing someone cares...
Right. How could we?
Lifetime of practice.
Try Buffy Summers. Like in the big fat  one-track way.
I was thinking more along the lines of a  long weekend, but okay.
Where are we going, girlfriend?
Why should you get all the fun? Share  share, that's fair.
Oh. Well, let's go look him up.
Right.
Yeah, well, I was uh, patrolling. No  shortage of scum you gotta watch in  Sunnydale, right?
Bettin' they got the Books, too. Some hit.
Maybe the guy put up a fight.
We gotta get gone. Come on. Nothing  we can do here now.
Hey. Sorry to bust in uninvited.
Look, I'm not so good at apologies.  Mostly 'cause I think the world's out to  screw me, so I'm generally more owed  than owing, you know?
No, it's not all right. Yeah, I was  freaked, and needed somebody, but  you're with Buffy. I should  know better.
You don't trust me.
Hey, no problem. Join the club.
Chump.
I wanted to do this the old-fashioned  way, but hey. Your loss. Luckily, I got  some tricks Buffy don't know yet.
I know, but it's fun. Relax. It'll be over soon.
I've got my reasons.
You want to be smart? You listen to me.
Not how Buffy tells it.
You wanna listen or you wanna die?
Last time you got like this, Buffy  kicked your ass all the way back to Hell. Want to do better this  time?
Then get ready to meet the new boss.
So? Can I keep him?
Let's do it.
Knock knock.
We got the Books.
We'd take 'em to Giles ourselves, but I  think strength in numbers is the way to  go. Come on.
Speak for yourself, B. Me? I like it here.
Bondage looks good on you, B. The  outfit's all wrong, but hey.
Really? Weird. 'Cause something about  all this just feels so right. Maybe it's one of those unhappy  childhood things.
Yeah? Huh. Guess we'll just have to  keep you around awhile, then.
What isn't? You know, I come to  Sunnydale, I'm a Slayer, I do my job  kicking ass better than anyone, and  what do I hear about, everywhere I go?
Everybody asks, "why can't you be  more like Buffy," but did anyone ever  ask if you could be more like me?
You get the Watcher, you get the mom,  you get your little Scooby Gang, what  do I get? Jack squat! This was supposed  to be my town!
Why? So you can impart some special  Buffy wisdom? That it? You think  you're better than me? Do you? Say it!  You think you're better than me!
Uh... maybe you didn't notice - Angel's  with me.
Uh-uh - you're just trying to make me  mad so I'll kill you - but I'm too smart  for that. Stick around.
You can't.
Keep dreaming. No one can stop the  Ascension! Mayor's got it wired, B. He  built this town for the demons to feed  on and come Graduation day, he's  getting paid. I'll be sitting at his right  hand - assuming he has hands after the  transformation, I'm not too clear on that  - and all your lame ass friends'll be  kibbles and bits. Think about that while  your boyfriend's cutting into you.
What can I say? I'm the world's best actor.
You played me? You played me?!?
Yeah, and you're annoying.
Wouldn't exactly call them friends.
