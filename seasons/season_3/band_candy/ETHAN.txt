(shaken) Okay. Um . . . how did you know he'd taken some.
(into phone) I've been out there. The town's wide open. You guys are good to go any time . . .

I would like to point out that this wasn't my idea.
I'm subcontracting. It's Trick you want. I'm just helping him collect a tribute. For a demon.
I don't remember.
Lurconis. Demon called Lurconis. They wanted a way they could get the tribute away from people.
More than a diversion. They said the tribute was big. So big that people would never let them take it. People had to be out of it, and later on, when the candy wears off, they would blame themselves.
I don't know exactly. Delivering the tribute.
