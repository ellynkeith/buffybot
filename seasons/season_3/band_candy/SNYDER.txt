It's band candy.
You will sell it. To raise money for the marching band. They need new uniforms.
And if I had just handed you a trombone, that would be a problem, Summers. It's candy. Sell it.
Look, the big pinhead librarian didn't show up and I don't want to do it. You do it.
(to himself) Everyone expects me to do everything around here 'cause I'm the principal and it's not fair . . .
(continuing) This place is fun city, huh?
Call me Snyder. Just a last name. Like Barbarino. Whoo! I'm stoked! Did you see Ms. Barton? I think she's wasted. I'm gonna put that on her next performance review because I'm the principal.
I got a commendation. For being principal. From the mayor. He shook my hand twice.
Ooh. There's some <u>foxy</u> ladies here tonight!
(to Oz) You've got great hair.
Fight! Fight!
Where are we going?
You guys aren't trying to ditch me, are you?
Hey, I <u>said</u> "wait up"!
Whoa, Summers, you drive like a spaz.
This is great! Let's go do doughnuts  on the football field.
Buffy, your mom's gonna kill you.
Hey! Give it!
That guy took my candy!
(scared) A curse? I've got a curse?
I don't know. It came to me through the school board, and if you knew that crowd . . .
Neat. Hey Brit-face, wait up.
It smells all chocolatey.
Uh-huh.
So, are you two, like, going steady?
She whupped you good, huh? Pow-ka- pow. I can do that, too. I took Tae Kwon Do at the Y.
(shaken) I think that's so wrong.
Is that what happens now?
Good. You guys go there and do that thing with the demon. I'll stay here in case the babies, you know, find their way back.
If you want to go splash around in poo, you're the filthy one.
I can do that.
That's <u>Principal</u> Snyder.
You look like four young people with too much time on your hands.
Good, because it seems we had some vandalism Friday, on school property, and I was just looking for some volunteers to help clean up.
Let's get you some paint remover.
