GILES: ". . . and on that tragic day, an era came to its inevitable end." That's all there is. Are you ready?
BUFFY: Hit me.
GILES: Which of the following best expresses the theme of the passage? A: "violence breeds violence." B: "all things must end."
GILES: C --
BUFFY: I'm putting "B". There hasn't been a "B" in forever.
GILES: This is the S.A.T.s, Buffy, not "connect-the-dots". Please pay attention. A low score could seriously harm your chances of getting into college.
BUFFY: Oh, that takes the pressure right off.
GILES: This isn't supposed to be easy, you know. It's a rite of passage.
BUFFY: Is it too late to join a tribe where they just pierce something, or cut something off?
GILES: Buffy, please. Concentrate.
BUFFY: Roll!
BUFFY: Broke my number two pencil. Sorry. We'll have to do this again some--
GILES: C: "all systems tend toward chaos".
BUFFY: I just know us and the undead are the only people in Sunnydale working at this hour.
MAYOR: . . . for you . . . but I think you'll  agree this matter is urgent. Also delicate.
TRICK: Well, I'm a very delicate person.
MAYOR: So you feel you can handle this?
TRICK: It's a little out of my element, but I can get you what you need. I know a beast who knows a guy.
MAYOR: Are you sure subcontracting is the way to go here?
TRICK: I believe this guy's worked in your town before. If he lives up to his rep, the place'll be in flames.
MAYOR: I've made certain deals to get where I am today. This demon requires his tribute. You see, that's what separates me from other politicians, Mr. Trick . . .
MAYOR: . . . I keep my campaign promises.
MAYOR: Now, where did I put the scotch?
BUFFY: And then I was getting chased by an improperly filled-in answer bubble yelling "none of the above"!
WILLOW: Wow. I hope that wasn't one of your prophecy dreams. (then) Probably not.
OZ: You know, Willow and I both took it last year. We could help you get ready. There's this whole trick to antonyms but . . . (looking around, whispering) this isn't the place.
WILLOW: Oz is the highest scoring person ever to fail to graduate.
BUFFY: (to Oz) Isn't she cute when she's proud?
OZ: She's always cute.
WILLOW: We could work on it tonight.
XANDER: Work on what tonight?
CORDELIA: Oh god, are we killing something again?
BUFFY: Only my carefree spirit.
OZ: Buffy S.A.T.-prep.
WILLOW: Oz is helping. He's the highest scoring person--
CORDELIA: We know. We did the impressed thing already.
XANDER: I hate they make us take that thing. It's totally fascist, and personally, I think it discriminates against the uninformed.
CORDELIA: Actually, I'm looking forward to it. I do well on standardized tests. (off their looks) What? I can't have layers?
WILLOW: So Buffy, study, tonight?
BUFFY: Um . . . yes on the study, no on  tonight. Putting in Mom-time. She's been like, drastic ever since I got back. And Giles is even worse. Between the two of them I'm  supervised twenty-four seven. It's like living in the Real World house, only real.
WILLOW: (pleased) Chocolate bars. Lots of 'em!
XANDER: Principal Snyder, thank you! You weren't visited by the ghost of Christmas past by any chance?
SNYDER: It's band candy.
BUFFY: Let's hear it for the band, huh? Very generous.
SNYDER: You will sell it. To raise money for the marching band. They need new uniforms.
XANDER: Those tall fuzzy hats ain't cheap, huh?
OZ: But they go with everything.
BUFFY: Um, as much as I'm sure we all love the idea of going all Willy Loman . . . we're not in the band.
SNYDER: And if I had just handed you a trombone, that would be a problem, Summers. It's candy. Sell it.
JOYCE: You're not in the band.
BUFFY: And yet.
JOYCE: Buffy, what would I do with forty  chocolate bars?
BUFFY: You could give them out at the gallery. Buy something Pre- Columbian, get a free cavity.
JOYCE: Twenty.
BUFFY: You're a good mom.
JOYCE: I'm the best.
BUFFY: (playful) Oh, I'm pretty sure the <u>best</u> moms let  their daughters drive.
JOYCE: And yet.
BUFFY: Come on --
JOYCE: Oh, let's not have this conversation.
BUFFY: I took the class. And I watched all the filmstrips with the blood and the  death and the corpses -- I'm prepped!
JOYCE: Honey, you failed the written test. They wouldn't even let you take the road test.
BUFFY: That was a year ago. And I don't  test well. She said, two days before the S.A.T.s.
JOYCE: I spend enough time not knowing where you are. I don't want to add the possibility that you're on the highway to Chicago.
BUFFY: I can't believe you. I'm not going to take off again. And if I was, I could just get on a bus--
JOYCE: Stop. Don't. I just . . . don't want you driving, okay? I want you here.
BUFFY: Okay, I'm here. See me being here.
BUFFY: Gotta go.
JOYCE: What? You're going out?
BUFFY: Giles. Slay-study double feature. Could be late.
JOYCE: Again? Honey, don't you think Mr. Giles is monopolizing an awful lot of your time?
BUFFY: And does he ever say he's sorry?
BUFFY: Ow!
GILES: Sorry.
BUFFY: Why do I put up with this?
GILES: Because it is your destiny and because I just bought twenty "cocorific" candy bars.
BUFFY: Okay, now you're just doing this to take funny pictures of me.
GILES: I'm testing your awareness of an opponent's location during a fight in total darkness. You're to wait five seconds, then throw me the ball.
BUFFY: You ran out of training ideas about a week ago, didn't you? Okay. Five, four, three-two-one.
GILES: Not so simple, is--
GILES: Ow. Ah. Well done.
BUFFY: Thanks.
GILES: Wait, you're not going? We have to patrol.
BUFFY: Can't. I told you, Mom's in hyperdrive. She wants me home tonight.
GILES: Oh. But--
BUFFY: I know. She's out of control. Enjoy the candy!
ANGEL: Buffy.
BUFFY: I didn't know you could do that.
ANGEL: I'm doing better . . .
BUFFY: Angel!
ANGEL: It's late. How did you get away?
BUFFY: Easy. Started a fire in the prison laundry, rode out in the garbage truck.
ANGEL: Oh.
BUFFY: Joking. No garbage. Smell me.
ANGEL: How is . . . Scott?
BUFFY: Oh, Scott, Boyfriend Scott, actually he's not -- He's fine.
BUFFY: I brought more . . . for you. From the butcher's.
ANGEL: Thank you.
ANGEL: You're being careful, right?
BUFFY: With Scott?
ANGEL: The slaying.
BUFFY: Oh, of course. Yeah, sure I am. I'm full of carefulness.
ANGEL: I worry about you.
BUFFY: Likewise.
ANGEL: I'm getting stronger.
BUFFY: Yeah. Soon you won't need me.
ANGEL: That'll be better.
BUFFY: (no it won't) Yeah.
BUFFY: Hi. Sorry I'm late, but you know Giles. All slay, all the time.
GILES: Hello, Buffy.
BUFFY: Hi. Um . . . you guys want to watch TV? I hear Nightline's very insightful.
JOYCE: You <u>lied</u> to us, Buffy. And you made us into your alibis. That's playing us against each other and that's not fair.
GILES: I called Willow. You lied to her about your whereabouts also. We were all concerned.
GILES: (to Joyce) Thank you.
BUFFY: I'm sorry. It's just, I had to go--
JOYCE: Were you at the Bronze? What was happening there that was so important?
BUFFY: Oh. Um . . . Bronze things. Things of Bronze.
JOYCE: You're acting really immature, Buffy.
GILES: I know I'm not your parent, but I do have to look after you. Your mom's right.
BUFFY: Okay, so I'm acting like a child. Maybe that's 'cause you're both <u>treating</u> me like a child.
JOYCE: Buffy!
BUFFY: No. Listen. You're both scheduling me twenty-four hours a day, and between the two of you, that's . . . forty-eight hours, and I just want to make some decisions on my own.
JOYCE: The last time you made a decision on your own you split.
BUFFY: And I took care of myself just fine. I don't need quite this much "active parenting", thank you very much.
JOYCE: You can't really be trying to use this summer as a reason you should be trusted!
BUFFY: Mom, you gotta back off some! I don't need to be baby-sat.
GILES: All right, come on. Let's not freak out.
BUFFY: Let's not what?
GILES: I think you should go to bed. We're all tired.
JOYCE: (to Giles) She drives me crazy. I just want to protect her.
GILES: All parents want that.
JOYCE: Yeah, but at least most parents know what to protect their children from.
GILES: Yeah, you and I have to be especially careful.
ETHAN: Trust me. You don't want to eat that.
CORDELIA: I heard there's this secret rule if a teacher is over ten minutes late, everyone can leave.
BUFFY: It's Giles' turn to lead study hall. He'll be here. He's allergic to late.
CORDELIA: The man <u>is</u> wrapped a little tight. I had this philosophy book out from the library for like a year and he made me pay the fine even though it was huge. I eventually had to return it, which was sad because it was perfect for starting conversations with college boys. Of course, that was B.X.
BUFFY: B.X.? Oh, Before Xander. Clever.
XANDER: I like chocolate. There's no bad here.
WILLOW: You still have some left? I went to like four houses and they were gone. It was like trick-or-treating in reverse.
XANDER: I know, they're selling like hot cakes. Which is ironic, 'cause the hot cakes really aren't moving.
WILLOW: (distracted) We're raising a lot of money for the band.
XANDER: (also distracted) Yeah. They're great. They march.
WILLOW: (not listening to herself) Like an army. With music instead of bullets and usually no one dies.
CORDELIA: I can't believe this!
CORDELIA: Where is Giles already? I'm bored and he's not here to give me credit for it.
SNYDER: Look, the big pinhead librarian didn't show up and I don't want to do it. You do it.
BARTON: All right. Fine. I'll do it.
SNYDER: (to himself) Everyone expects me to do everything around here 'cause I'm the principal and it's not fair . . .
BARTON: (very tough) Hey, hey!
BARTON: Look, we're all stuck here, okay? So let's just sit quietly . . . (lowering her voice) And pretend to read or something until we're sure Commandant Snyder is gone, and then we're all out of here.
XANDER: Anyone else want to marry Ms. Barton?
CORDELIA: Get in line.
WILLOW: I guess Giles isn't coming.
BUFFY: (concerned) I guess not.
GILES: Buffy!
JOYCE: Oh!
BUFFY: Sorry. I was worried, Giles. You were a big not-there in study hall and after your lecture on <u>me</u> not ducking out and what is my mother doing here?
GILES: We had an opportunity for a, you might say, a summit meeting. It took priority over study hall. I called in.
BUFFY: Oh.
JOYCE: We decided you made a good point. earlier, honey.
BUFFY: I did. Yes. And that was . . . ?
JOYCE: About us over-scheduling you.
GILES: Pulling you in two directions, as it were . . . your home life and your duties as a slayer.
BUFFY: Oh. That <u>was</u> a good point.
JOYCE: We're working out a coordinated schedule for you.
GILES: It will be tight, but I think we can fit in all your responsibilities.
BUFFY: (less enthused) Sounds nice 'n' structured.
JOYCE: We've got more work to do here, honey. Why don't you give us a little more time? Take the car. Mr. Giles can drive me home.
BUFFY: What? Excuse me, I meant: what?
JOYCE: Keys. Take them.
BUFFY: Hey, you don't have to tell me twice. Well, you did. But . . . bye.
JOYCE: Bye, honey. Drive careful.
JOYCE: You think she noticed anything?
GILES: No way.
WILLOW: Tell me again how it happened.
BUFFY: I told her I wanted to be treated more like a grown-up, and voila! Driviness.
WILLOW: Ooh.
BUFFY: Also, I think Mom might've wanted me, you know, otherwhere. Giles and her are planning my future and I guess it's easier to live my life if I'm  not actually there.
WILLOW: You know you've got the parking brake on?
BUFFY: Uh-huh.
WILLOW: Are you sure about the Bronze? The S.A.T.s are tomorrow.
BUFFY: I can study at the Bronze. A little dancing, a little cross-multiplying. Hey, you know what we need?
WILLOW: (terrified) Eyes on the road! Eyes on the road!
JOYCE: You've got good albums.
GILES: Yeah, they're all right.
JOYCE: Do you like Seals and Croft? (off his look) Me neither.
JOYCE: How come they call you Ripper?
GILES: Wouldn't <b>you</b> like to know.
GILES: Hey, listen to this bit. It rocks.
JOYCE: It's good.
GILES: Man. I gotta get a band together.
JOYCE: So, you wanna watch TV, Ripper? I know how to order pay-per-view.
GILES: Let's go out. Have some fun. Tear things up.
JOYCE: Okay. We could go to the Bronze.
GILES: Not bloody likely. That place is dead.
BUFFY: Whoa. Let's do the time warp again.
WILLOW: Maybe there's some kind of reunion in town or a Billy Joel tour or something.
BUFFY: Ms. Barton?
BARTON: Buffy? Whoa.
WILLOW: You okay, Ms. Barton?
BARTON: I'm cool, Willow. Willow. That's a tree. You're a tree. Do they have nachos here, little tree?
BUFFY: I think maybe you need some fresh air.
BARTON: Okay.
WILLOW: Okay, this is not normal. (off Buffy's look) Maybe that goes without saying.
SNYDER: (continuing) This place is fun city, huh?
BUFFY: Principal Snyder?
SNYDER: Call me Snyder. Just a last name. Like Barbarino. Whoo! I'm stoked! Did you see Ms. Barton? I think she's wasted. I'm gonna put that on her next performance review because I'm the principal.
WILLOW: I don't like this. They could have heart attacks.
BUFFY: Maybe there's a doctor here.
WILLOW: Actually, that <u>is</u> my doctor. He's usually less . . . topless.
SNYDER: I got a commendation. For being principal. From the mayor. He shook my hand twice.
SNYDER: Ooh. There's some <u>foxy</u> ladies here tonight!
WILLOW: (to Buffy) Buffy, what's happening?
BUFFY: I don't know, but it's happening to a whole lotta grownups.
WILLOW: They're acting like a bunch of . . .
BUFFY: They're acting like a bunch of us.
WILLOW: I don't act like this . . .
TRICK: Demand's high.
ETHAN: I thought it might be.
TRICK: That's why I love this country. You make a good product, and the people will come to you. Of course, a lot of them are gonna die, but, well, that's the other reason I love this country.
TRICK: Hey. No sampling the product.
WORKMAN: (terrified) I didn't --
ETHAN: (shaken) Okay. Um . . . how did you know he'd taken some.
TRICK: I don't. But I know no one else will. (looks at his watch) We're getting close. Keep it flowing. Time for me to get the goods.
BUFFY: Something's changing them.
WILLOW: A spell?
OZ: They're teenagers. Sobering mirror to look into, huh?
SNYDER: (to Oz) You've got great hair.
WILLOW: It just gets more upsetting.
BUFFY: No vampire has ever been <u>that</u> scary.
SNYDER: Fight! Fight!
BUFFY: We've gotta go find out what's going on. This has Hellmouth fingerprints all over it. Or, mouthprints . . .
SNYDER: Where are we going?
SNYDER: You guys aren't trying to ditch me, are you?
OZ: We should go find Giles, right? He'll figure out what's going on.
BUFFY: Sure, except for all we know he's sweet sixteen again.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) He's with your mom at his place.
SNYDER: Hey, I <u>said</u> "wait up"!
OZ: Um . . . Snyder . . .
BUFFY: No time. He's coming with us.
SNYDER: Whoa, Summers, you drive like a spaz.
SNYDER: This is great! Let's go do doughnuts  on the football field.
WILLOW: (convincing herself) It'll be okay when we get to Giles'.
OZ: Of course. I mean, even if he's sixteen, he's still Giles. Probably a pretty together guy.
WILLOW: Yeah, well.
OZ: What?
BUFFY: Giles at sixteen. Less "together guy", more "bad magic, hates the world, ticking time-bomb guy".
OZ: Oh. Well then, I guess your mom is in a lot of trouble.
JOYCE: It must be exciting, being from England.
GILES: It's all right. Hey, you're not cold or anything?
JOYCE: Nuh-uh. I feel . . . special. Like I'm just waking up, kind of.
GILES: How's that?
JOYCE: You know, like having a kid and getting married and everything was a dream and now things are back like they're supposed to be.
GILES: Yeah.
JOYCE: That's cool. Kind of Juice Newton.
GILES: You fancy it?
JOYCE: But the store's not open.
GILES: Here.
JOYCE: Oh, Ripper, wow. That was so brave.
WILLOW: Oh my god! Look out!
GILES: Oh, copper's got a gun. You'll never use it.
POLICEMAN: Will so.
JOYCE: Ripper, be careful!
GILES: Told him he'd never use it.
JOYCE: You are so cool. You're like Burt Reynolds.
WILLOW: Is anyone else all creeped out and trembly?
SNYDER: Buffy, your mom's gonna kill you.
BUFFY: (thoughtful) Something's weird.
OZ: Something's not?
BUFFY: No grown ups. No one's protecting their houses, people out wandering around--
WILLOW: (getting it) Defenseless.
SNYDER: Hey! Give it!
BUFFY: So where are all the vampires? Soup's on, but no one's grabbing a spoon.
OZ: Something's happening somewhere that's else.
BUFFY: I'm guessing something pretty big.
SNYDER: That guy took my candy!
BUFFY: What's with the candy? A curse?
SNYDER: (scared) A curse? I've got a curse?
WILLOW: Oh my god. Using candy for evil.
OZ: My parents ate a ton.
BUFFY: Who's behind the candy?
SNYDER: I don't know. It came to me through the school board, and if you knew that crowd . . .
BUFFY: Where is it? Where would you go for more? Do you know?
BUFFY: You two, get Xander and Cordelia, go to the library. Look it up.
OZ: Candy, curses . . .
WILLOW: Disturbing second childhood. Got it.
BUFFY: Ratboy and I are going to the source.
BUFFY: Giles? Mom?!
GILES: Go 'way. We're busy.
JOYCE: Hey!
BUFFY: Mom-- (notices) Where'd you get that coat? Never mind, listen to me--
BUFFY: Okay, Giles. Think. You really want to fight me? Or you want to let me talk to my mother?
BUFFY: Mom, look at me. Do you know who I am?
JOYCE: Of course. You're Buffy. They're giving away candy. Want some candy?
BUFFY: No. And you don't need any more either.
JOYCE: I'm fine. I can have more if I want.
BUFFY: You're not fine. Go home.
JOYCE: Screw you. I want candy.
BUFFY: Mom!
JOYCE: Hey look, you want to slay stuff and I'm not allowed to do anything about it? Well, this is what <u>I</u> want to do. So get off my back.
BUFFY: (genuinely upset) Mom. Please.
GILES: For god's sake, let your mum have the bleedin' candy. Come on, Joyce.
BUFFY: Wait. Look for one sec. Your car. The dent the size of New Brunswick? I did that.
JOYCE: Oh my god. What was I thinking when I bought the geek machine?
BUFFY: Take her home.
GILES: Hey. I'm the watcher. You have to do what I say. So bugger off.
MAN: Hey, what--
JOYCE: Hey!
GILES: What're you doing with her?
SNYDER: Neat. Hey Brit-face, wait up.
GILES: Hold it!
SNYDER: It smells all chocolatey.
GILES: Say. This is all right.
ETHAN: (into phone) I've been out there. The town's wide open. You guys are good to go any time . . .
BUFFY: Ethan Rayne.
ETHAN: (into phone) You may want to hurry.
CORDELIA: At first it was fun, you know. They seemed like they were in this really good mood. You know, not like parents. Then . . .
WILLOW: Badness?
CORDELIA: Mom started borrowing all my clothes. There should be an age limit on Lycra pants, I'm telling you. And dad just locked himself in the bathroom with a bunch of old copies of Esquire.
XANDER: I don't get this. The candy's supposed to make you all immature and stuff, but I ate a ton and I don't feel any dif-- never mind.
WILLOW: I'll take that one.
CORDELIA: Wanna swap?
WILLOW: What, swap, huh?
CORDELIA: Hello? Swap books with me? This one is thick, and I'm not sure it's in English.
GILES: Ethan?
JOYCE: (to Giles) You know him? Who is he?
GILES: Where--
BUFFY: That's what smoking'll do to you. Now be quiet.
GILES: Where'd the bastard go?
BUFFY: Shh.
BUFFY: Look, a box full of farm-fresh chicken.
JOYCE: You s'pose they're okay?
SNYDER: Uh-huh.
SNYDER: So, are you two, like, going steady?
BUFFY: So, Ethan. What are we playing? (he says nothing) We're pretty much into a 'talk or bleed' situation. Your call.
ETHAN: I would like to point out that this wasn't my idea.
BUFFY: Meaning?
ETHAN: I'm subcontracting. It's Trick you want. I'm just helping him collect a tribute. For a demon.
GILES: He's lying. Hit him!
BUFFY: I don't think he is. And shut up.
GILES: You're <u>my</u> slayer. Knock those capped teeth down his throat!
BUFFY: Giles. (to Ethan) What demon?
ETHAN: I don't remember.
GILES: 'bout time.
ETHAN: Lurconis. Demon called Lurconis. They wanted a way they could get the tribute away from people.
BUFFY: So you're just diversion guy?
ETHAN: More than a diversion. They said the tribute was big. So big that people would never let them take it. People had to be out of it, and later on, when the candy wears off, they would blame themselves.
BUFFY: Hence, Land of the Irresponsible. So where's Trick?
ETHAN: I don't know exactly. Delivering the tribute.
BUFFY: Which brings us to the bonus-round question and believe me when I say a wrong answer will cost you <b>all</b> your points . . . (in his face) <u>what's the tribute</u>?
BUFFY: (into phone) Right. "Lurconis".
WILLOW: (urgent) Lurconis. A demon. What's his deal?
WILLOW: A tribute? Like what?
SNYDER: She whupped you good, huh? Pow-ka- pow. I can do that, too. I took Tae Kwon Do at the Y.
BUFFY: (into the phone) No, definitely a demon. A big one.
GILES: I wouldn't.
BUFFY: (calmly) Giles. I need you to give me the gun.
JOYCE: (to Buffy, holding the phone) Willow wants you. Real bad.
WILLOW: (on phone) Oz just found it. The tribute to Lurconis is made every thirty years. It's a ritual feeding and this one's late, so it's probably, you know, a big meal.
WILLOW: Oh, and . . . oh . . . Lurconis eats babies.
BUFFY: Come on.
JOYCE: (re: Ethan) What about that man?
BUFFY: Look for something to tie him up.
JOYCE: Um . . .
BUFFY: (to Joyce) Never tell me.
JOYCE: Something's going to eat those babies?
SNYDER: (shaken) I think that's so wrong.
GILES: She never even saw who took them. Lazy cow.
BUFFY: I know who took them.
GILES: So, let's go do something, right? Find the demon, slash and slay.
SNYDER: Is that what happens now?
BUFFY: Yeah, if we knew where to go.
GILES: "Lurconis dwells beneath the city, filth to filth".
BUFFY: What?
GILES: I know this. I knew this. "Lurconis", it means "glutton", and . . . it'll be in the sewers.
JOYCE: The sewers?
BUFFY: (resigned) Okay. The sewers.
SNYDER: Good. You guys go there and do that thing with the demon. I'll stay here in case the babies, you know, find their way back.
JOYCE: The babies must be so scared.
GILES: You filthy ponce. Afraid of a little demon.
SNYDER: If you want to go splash around in poo, you're the filthy one.
BUFFY: All right, everybody stop it! Listen to me. Mom, I need help. Okay? Giles? I need grown ups. These children are going to die and we have to think clearly and act now if we're gonna save them. There's no room for mistakes. Besides which, you guys are just wigging me out.
GILES: Sorry.
JOYCE: We'll behave.
BUFFY: Good. Snyder, go home.
SNYDER: I can do that.
BUFFY: Giles, take us to the sewers. (re: holding hands) And don't do that.
MAYOR: (into phone) Carol, call Dave on the Public Works committee tomorrow about sewer maintenance and repair. I have some concerns re: exposed gas pipes, infrastructure, ventilation. And cancel my three o'clock.
TRICK: (softly) Come on, big guy. They're not getting any fresher.
BUFFY: Hi.
GILES: What the hell's that?
GILES: Good God.
BUFFY: Lurconis, I'm thinking.
TRICK: Ordinarily, I like other people to do my fighting, but I just have to see what you got.
BUFFY: Just tell me when it hurts.
BUFFY: Giles, no!
BUFFY: Giles! Get out of there!
BUFFY: I love that you guys love torches.
TRICK: You and me, girl. There's high times ahead.
BUFFY: They never just leave. They always gotta say something . . .
JOYCE: Can we go home now?
BUFFY: Yeah. Let's go home. I've got the S.A.T.s tomorrow.
JOYCE: Oh, blow them off. I'll write you a note.
BUFFY: No. That's okay.
MAYOR: And your friend?
TRICK: I paid him. Man did his job, no reason to burn that bridge.
MAYOR: This didn't turn out the way I had planned.
TRICK: Where's the downside? You just got one less demon to pay tribute to. Way I see it, I just did you a favor.
MAYOR: (smiling) I guess you did.
MAYOR: In the future, I'd be very careful how many favors you do for me.
XANDER: Hey, Snyder, heard you had some fun Friday night. You come down yet?
SNYDER: That's <u>Principal</u> Snyder.
XANDER: And that's a big "yep".
SNYDER: You look like four young people with too much time on your hands.
OZ: Not really.
CORDELIA: Busy like a bee, actually. Bee-like.
SNYDER: Good, because it seems we had some vandalism Friday, on school property, and I was just looking for some volunteers to help clean up.
WILLOW: Kiss rocks? Why would anyone want to kiss--? Oh, wait. I get it.
SNYDER: Let's get you some paint remover.
BUFFY: It was just too much to deal with. It's like nothing made sense anymore. The things I thought I understood were . . . gone. I felt so alone.
GILES: Was that the math or the verbal?
BUFFY: Mostly the math.
GILES: Well, if you didn't score well, you can take them again.
BUFFY: More S.A.T.s. Great. Is there really a point? I could die before I even apply to college.
GILES: And you very probably may not.
BUFFY: Well, let's keep hope alive . . .
GILES: Hello. Dear me, it certainly looks like your car had an adventure, doesn't it?
JOYCE: Buffy assures me it happened while battling evil, so I'm letting her pay for it on the installment plan.
BUFFY: Hey, the way things were going, be glad this is the worst thing that happened. At least I got to you two before you, you know, actually <b>did</b> anything.
JOYCE: Right.
GILES: Indeed.
JOYCE: Yes.
