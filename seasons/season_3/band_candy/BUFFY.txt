Hit me.
I'm putting "B". There hasn't been a "B" in forever.
Oh, that takes the pressure right off.
Is it too late to join a tribe where they just pierce something, or cut something off?
Roll!
Broke my number two pencil. Sorry. We'll have to do this again some--
I just know us and the undead are the only people in Sunnydale working at this hour.
And then I was getting chased by an improperly filled-in answer bubble yelling "none of the above"!
(to Oz) Isn't she cute when she's proud?
Only my carefree spirit.
Um . . . yes on the study, no on  tonight. Putting in Mom-time. She's been like, drastic ever since I got back. And Giles is even worse. Between the two of them I'm  supervised twenty-four seven. It's like living in the Real World house, only real.
Let's hear it for the band, huh? Very generous.
Um, as much as I'm sure we all love the idea of going all Willy Loman . . . we're not in the band.
And yet.
You could give them out at the gallery. Buy something Pre- Columbian, get a free cavity.
You're a good mom.
(playful) Oh, I'm pretty sure the <u>best</u> moms let  their daughters drive.
Come on --
I took the class. And I watched all the filmstrips with the blood and the  death and the corpses -- I'm prepped!
That was a year ago. And I don't  test well. She said, two days before the S.A.T.s.
I can't believe you. I'm not going to take off again. And if I was, I could just get on a bus--
Okay, I'm here. See me being here.
Gotta go.
Giles. Slay-study double feature. Could be late.
And does he ever say he's sorry?
Ow!
Why do I put up with this?
Okay, now you're just doing this to take funny pictures of me.
You ran out of training ideas about a week ago, didn't you? Okay. Five, four, three-two-one.
Thanks.
Can't. I told you, Mom's in hyperdrive. She wants me home tonight.
I know. She's out of control. Enjoy the candy!
I didn't know you could do that.
Angel!
Easy. Started a fire in the prison laundry, rode out in the garbage truck.
Joking. No garbage. Smell me.
Oh, Scott, Boyfriend Scott, actually he's not -- He's fine.
I brought more . . . for you. From the butcher's.
With Scott?
Oh, of course. Yeah, sure I am. I'm full of carefulness.
Likewise.
Yeah. Soon you won't need me.
(no it won't) Yeah.
Hi. Sorry I'm late, but you know Giles. All slay, all the time.
Hi. Um . . . you guys want to watch TV? I hear Nightline's very insightful.
I'm sorry. It's just, I had to go--
Oh. Um . . . Bronze things. Things of Bronze.
Okay, so I'm acting like a child. Maybe that's 'cause you're both <u>treating</u> me like a child.
No. Listen. You're both scheduling me twenty-four hours a day, and between the two of you, that's . . . forty-eight hours, and I just want to make some decisions on my own.
And I took care of myself just fine. I don't need quite this much "active parenting", thank you very much.
Mom, you gotta back off some! I don't need to be baby-sat.
Let's not what?
It's Giles' turn to lead study hall. He'll be here. He's allergic to late.
B.X.? Oh, Before Xander. Clever.
(concerned) I guess not.
Sorry. I was worried, Giles. You were a big not-there in study hall and after your lecture on <u>me</u> not ducking out and what is my mother doing here?
Oh.
I did. Yes. And that was . . . ?
Oh. That <u>was</u> a good point.
(less enthused) Sounds nice 'n' structured.
What? Excuse me, I meant: what?
Hey, you don't have to tell me twice. Well, you did. But . . . bye.
I told her I wanted to be treated more like a grown-up, and voila! Driviness.
Also, I think Mom might've wanted me, you know, otherwhere. Giles and her are planning my future and I guess it's easier to live my life if I'm  not actually there.
Uh-huh.
I can study at the Bronze. A little dancing, a little cross-multiplying. Hey, you know what we need?
Whoa. Let's do the time warp again.
Ms. Barton?
I think maybe you need some fresh air.
Principal Snyder?
Maybe there's a doctor here.
I don't know, but it's happening to a whole lotta grownups.
They're acting like a bunch of us.
Something's changing them.
No vampire has ever been <u>that</u> scary.
We've gotta go find out what's going on. This has Hellmouth fingerprints all over it. Or, mouthprints . . .
Sure, except for all we know he's sweet sixteen again.
No time. He's coming with us.
Giles at sixteen. Less "together guy", more "bad magic, hates the world, ticking time-bomb guy".
(thoughtful) Something's weird.
No grown ups. No one's protecting their houses, people out wandering around--
So where are all the vampires? Soup's on, but no one's grabbing a spoon.
I'm guessing something pretty big.
What's with the candy? A curse?
Who's behind the candy?
Where is it? Where would you go for more? Do you know?
You two, get Xander and Cordelia, go to the library. Look it up.
Ratboy and I are going to the source.
Giles? Mom?!
Mom-- (notices) Where'd you get that coat? Never mind, listen to me--
Okay, Giles. Think. You really want to fight me? Or you want to let me talk to my mother?
Mom, look at me. Do you know who I am?
No. And you don't need any more either.
You're not fine. Go home.
Mom!
(genuinely upset) Mom. Please.
Wait. Look for one sec. Your car. The dent the size of New Brunswick? I did that.
Take her home.
Ethan Rayne.
That's what smoking'll do to you. Now be quiet.
Shh.
Look, a box full of farm-fresh chicken.
So, Ethan. What are we playing? (he says nothing) We're pretty much into a 'talk or bleed' situation. Your call.
Meaning?
I don't think he is. And shut up.
Giles. (to Ethan) What demon?
So you're just diversion guy?
Hence, Land of the Irresponsible. So where's Trick?
Which brings us to the bonus-round question and believe me when I say a wrong answer will cost you <b>all</b> your points . . . (in his face) <u>what's the tribute</u>?
(into phone) Right. "Lurconis".
(into the phone) No, definitely a demon. A big one.
(calmly) Giles. I need you to give me the gun.
Come on.
Look for something to tie him up.
(to Joyce) Never tell me.
I know who took them.
Yeah, if we knew where to go.
What?
(resigned) Okay. The sewers.
All right, everybody stop it! Listen to me. Mom, I need help. Okay? Giles? I need grown ups. These children are going to die and we have to think clearly and act now if we're gonna save them. There's no room for mistakes. Besides which, you guys are just wigging me out.
Good. Snyder, go home.
Giles, take us to the sewers. (re: holding hands) And don't do that.
Hi.
Lurconis, I'm thinking.
Just tell me when it hurts.
Giles, no!
Giles! Get out of there!
I love that you guys love torches.
They never just leave. They always gotta say something . . .
Yeah. Let's go home. I've got the S.A.T.s tomorrow.
No. That's okay.
It was just too much to deal with. It's like nothing made sense anymore. The things I thought I understood were . . . gone. I felt so alone.
Mostly the math.
More S.A.T.s. Great. Is there really a point? I could die before I even apply to college.
Well, let's keep hope alive . . .
Hey, the way things were going, be glad this is the worst thing that happened. At least I got to you two before you, you know, actually <b>did</b> anything.
