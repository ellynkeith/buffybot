. . . for you . . . but I think you'll  agree this matter is urgent. Also delicate.
So you feel you can handle this?
Are you sure subcontracting is the way to go here?
I've made certain deals to get where I am today. This demon requires his tribute. You see, that's what separates me from other politicians, Mr. Trick . . .
. . . I keep my campaign promises.
Now, where did I put the scotch?
(into phone) Carol, call Dave on the Public Works committee tomorrow about sewer maintenance and repair. I have some concerns re: exposed gas pipes, infrastructure, ventilation. And cancel my three o'clock.
And your friend?
This didn't turn out the way I had planned.
(smiling) I guess you did.
In the future, I'd be very careful how many favors you do for me.
