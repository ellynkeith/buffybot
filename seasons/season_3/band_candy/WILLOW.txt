Wow. I hope that wasn't one of your prophecy dreams. (then) Probably not.
Oz is the highest scoring person ever to fail to graduate.
We could work on it tonight.
Oz is helping. He's the highest scoring person--
So Buffy, study, tonight?
(pleased) Chocolate bars. Lots of 'em!
You still have some left? I went to like four houses and they were gone. It was like trick-or-treating in reverse.
(distracted) We're raising a lot of money for the band.
(not listening to herself) Like an army. With music instead of bullets and usually no one dies.
I guess Giles isn't coming.
Tell me again how it happened.
Ooh.
You know you've got the parking brake on?
Are you sure about the Bronze? The S.A.T.s are tomorrow.
(terrified) Eyes on the road! Eyes on the road!
Maybe there's some kind of reunion in town or a Billy Joel tour or something.
You okay, Ms. Barton?
Okay, this is not normal. (off Buffy's look) Maybe that goes without saying.
I don't like this. They could have heart attacks.
Actually, that <u>is</u> my doctor. He's usually less . . . topless.
(to Buffy) Buffy, what's happening?
They're acting like a bunch of . . .
I don't act like this . . .
A spell?
It just gets more upsetting.
(to Buffy) He's with your mom at his place.
(convincing herself) It'll be okay when we get to Giles'.
Yeah, well.
Oh my god! Look out!
Is anyone else all creeped out and trembly?
(getting it) Defenseless.
Oh my god. Using candy for evil.
Disturbing second childhood. Got it.
Badness?
I'll take that one.
What, swap, huh?
(urgent) Lurconis. A demon. What's his deal?
A tribute? Like what?
(on phone) Oz just found it. The tribute to Lurconis is made every thirty years. It's a ritual feeding and this one's late, so it's probably, you know, a big meal.
Oh, and . . . oh . . . Lurconis eats babies.
Kiss rocks? Why would anyone want to kiss--? Oh, wait. I get it.
