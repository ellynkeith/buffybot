Not yet.
Thank you.
Tea is soothing. I wish to be tense.
Look through the Kippler volumes.  Any reference to the Demon Olvikan...  powers, weaknesses, hat size... there's  got to be something.
So far. But don't give up.
Shall I assay remorse?
Buffy has quit the Council. She'll not be  working with Wesley from now on.
Buffy no longer needs a watcher.
How is she?
You fed off her.
How much?
You'd best go, Angel. We can watch  over her.
The sun'll be up soon.
Let's see how Buffy's doing.
How do you feel?
Buffy, are you sure you're all right?
Let's not rule it out though.
I didn't say that. I might, but I haven't yet.
Buffy, all of this is dependant on your  being able to control the Mayor. How  do you plan to do that?
The Mayor's weakness.
Which is what?
Well, let us think.
I suppose it should be I. It's fitting, in  a grotesque fashion.
What about you?
How are you?
I'd imagine so. Quite a couple of days.
Understandable. Well, when it starts  working again, congratulate it on a  good campaign. You did very well.
(reaching into his pocket) I uh, I ferreted this out of the wreckage  for you. You may not have any interest, but...
Right. Sorry. I'd best check on Wesley,  see if he's still whimpering.
