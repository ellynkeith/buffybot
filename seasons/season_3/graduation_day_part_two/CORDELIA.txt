I demand an explanation.
Wesley!
So very funny. Any minute now I'm  sure to laugh. (to Giles) I just got off the phone with him.  He could hardy speak, he was so upset.  He said there'd been a fight, or  something and- (to Xander) TAHAHA what a witty comment- (to Giles, never missing a beat) -he said he was leaving the country.
Just tell me what's going on.
But he's her watcher!
Well, does he have to leave the country?  I mean, you got fired and you hang  around like a big loser, why can't he?
Sure.
Okay, well, I personally don't think it's  possible to come up with a crazier plan.
I stand corrected.
Thank you. My point, however, is crazy  or not, it's pretty much the only plan.  Besides, it's Buffy's and she's slay-gal,  you know. Miss Like-to-Fight, so...
Of course! That's it! We attack him  with germs!
No no, we get a canister of ebola virus,  and and, or it doesn't have to be real,  we could just have a box that says "ebola"  on it, and we could chase him... with the box...
Oh, you are SO classy. Isn't he  just so classy?
Yes?
Yes?
(crest fallen) I know.
I guess not.
No...
Needed...
Wanted...
That'd be neat.
Well, that was the most fun you can  have without having any fun.
I'm for it.
Pretty much.
