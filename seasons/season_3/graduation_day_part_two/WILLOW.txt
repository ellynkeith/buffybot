You're awake.
Well, we've been taking turns...
Oh. You mean you need Buffy?
Yes! Right. Good.
She'll be back soon...
He's delirious. He thought I was Buffy.
I hope she comes soon. I mean, she'd  better, if...
I feel so... I feel so guilty.
Well, things are just so terrible,  everything's coming apart, and I'm  just... in some ways it's the best night  of my life.
The best.
You didn't... she's not here?
We can keep looking for another cure.
We left her, she was fine? Did Faith --
Buffy!
Ready for what?
Well, "crazy's" a strong word --
Faith told you? Was that before or after  you put her in a coma?
Oh.
Fun with chemistry.
Percy --
You look great. You got a sec?
Just relax, have a good time.
I guess that's it. Won't be long now.
Only in a terrified way.
Are you sure?
Yeah...
Was that just a comforting way of not  answering the question?
Am I late? Did we fight?
Oh, man... just ascend, already!
Good luck.
What about the part where we kicked  demon ass? I didn't hate that.
Why do demons even come here anymore?  Don't they know how bad we are?
(to Buffy) You okay?
Yeah.
I was.
