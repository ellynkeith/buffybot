(shakes her head) How is he?
Why don't you guys... I'd like to be  with him.
Thanks.
It's me.
Angel, I can cure you.
Angel, listen to me. Sit up.
Drink.
It's the only --
It'll save you.
Maybe not, if you don't take all...
I won't let you die. I can't. The blood  of the Slayer is the only cure.
I tried to... I killed her.
No.  She moves to him. He shoves her aside and exits.
It's never over. I won't let you die. Drink.
Who's gonna look after him?
A higher power, guiding us?
There's something I'm supposed to  be doing.
Oh, great. Riddles.
What about you?
Is this your mind or mine?
How are you gonna fit all this stuff?
I can't use all this.
Where's Angel?
Get him. Get everyone.
(nods) I'm ready.
War.
That's the basic plan. So. Am I crazy?
(to Giles) You don't think it can be done.
Well, I need you all on board. Especially  you, Xander. You're kind of the key to  this figure here.
Do you still remember any of your  military training from when you became  soldier guy?
Rocket launcher's not gonna get it done.  Took a volcano to kill one of these things  last time.
Faith told me I'd have to play on his  human weakness. That's the way I'm  gonna get to him.
After.
Right.
(defensively) You know, I do all his planning, I'm in  charge even though I'm not feeling my  best, and now I'm supposed to come up  with every little detail...
Great. We'll get him cornered and then  you sneeze on him.
Faith. You think?
(wheels turning) Okay. Good. I can work that.
The Council isn't welcome here. I got  no time for orders. I need someone to  scream like a woman, I'll give you a call.
(pleased) It's a start.
There's plenty. Chores for everyone.  Okay, this is how it's going to lay out...
An eclipse.
Yes it does. I'll need you and Xander  working in sync here. Can you guys  handle that?
Right.
Oh, good, let's bicker! That'll work great. (off their shame) You're like little old ladies.
How are we on volcano detail?
Xander should be able to locate the materials.
Feel up to it?
Okay. (to the kids) You guys start reaching out.  (to Giles) Giles, weapons weapons weapons.
There's something I need to get.
I did.
I heal fast. Like you. Have you and  Xander worked out your timing?
My god... he's gonna do the whole speech.
Evil.
Come on...
NOW!
Fall back!
(to the students) Fall back! Get back! (to Willow) Go.
Xander! Take 'em down.
Hey!
Seems like we did.
Tired.
My brain hasn't processed everything yet.  It's not really functioning at the higher  levels; it's pretty much, "fire bad, tree  pretty". Anything more complex...
Thanks.
Fire bad. Tree pretty.
I think we've done pretty much everything  we can. You guys wanna take off?
Yeah. I'm okay. I just... I could use a  little sleep.
If somebody could just wake me up  when it's time to go to college, that'd  be great.
It was a hell of a battle.
When we blew it up?
Was that the school blew up?
I begin to find you troubling.
Well...
Yeah.
