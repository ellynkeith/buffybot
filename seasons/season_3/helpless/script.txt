BUFFY: Gotchya.
ANGEL: Right in the heart.
BUFFY: Satisfied?
ANGEL: I'm not sure that's the word...
BUFFY: Well, I didn't mean satisfied  like-
ANGEL: No, I wasn't trying to -
BUFFY: 'Cause we're not having satisfaction,  in the personal sense...
ANGEL: Of course.
BUFFY: (gathering her stuff) I should take off. Giles is -
ANGEL: Waiting for you. I know.
BUFFY: Thanks. For the work out.
ANGEL: Am I going to see you this weekend?  You probably have plans...
BUFFY: Birthday, right. Actually, yeah, I do  have a thing.
ANGEL: A thing? A date?
BUFFY: (smiling) Nice attempt at casual. It is a date.  Older man. Very handsome. Likes it  when I call him "Daddy."
ANGEL: (smiles) Your father. (sudden worry) It is your father...
BUFFY: He's taking me to the ice show. It's  great fun. And I could definitely use  a little more fun.
BUFFY: Amethyst.
GILES: Used for?
BUFFY: (stumped) Breath mint?
BUFFY: Okay, so: how do you know when your aura's dirty? Somebody come  by with a finger and write "wash me"  on it?
GILES: Buffy, I'm aware of your distaste for studying the vibratory stones, but as it's part of your training, I'd appreciate your glib-free attention.
BUFFY: Sorry. I just figure with Faith on one  of her unannounced walkabouts someone should be out patrolling.
GILES: Faith is not interested in proper  training, so I rely on you to keep up with yours.
BUFFY: I hate being the "good" one.
GILES: And as for patrolling, you'll be out there soon enough, why so anxious?
BUFFY: Let's just say I've got a lot of energy  to burn off.
GILES: Due time. For the present, if it's not entirely beyond your capabilities... try to concentrate.
BUFFY: Wow, that was really funny looking. Could you do that again?
VAMPIRE: I'll kill you for that!
BUFFY: For that? What were you trying to  kill me for before?
VAMPIRE: Let me know if I'm not doing this  right.
GILES: Bit early in the day...
BUFFY: Giles, something's wrong.
GILES: Wrong?
GILES: Ah. Maybe you shouldn't -
BUFFY: On top of that, I got a bad case of the  dizzies last night and almost let a vamp  stake me. With my own stake!  (throws again, wide) I am way off my game, my game's  left the country, it's in Cuernavaca,  what's going on here?
GILES: Well... probably you've just  contracted a flu-bug or something.
BUFFY: Oh, no. Not sick. I can't get sick.
GILES: Buffy, with precautions, there's no reason to think you'll end up in the hospital like last time.
BUFFY: No, my father's coming up to take  me to the ice show. We do it every year for my birthday. If I cancel on  him, it'll break his heart.
GILES: Perhaps you should take it easy for the next forty-eight hours. Forego any more patrolling until you're  feeling yourself again.
BUFFY: No, no - I think I need to spend a  little more time training...
BUFFY: I'm gone.
GILES: Thank you.
XANDER: (to Buffy)  An ice show. A show performed on ice. And how old are we, again?
WILLOW: I saw "Snoopy on Ice" once when  I was little. My dad took me backstage and I got scared and threw up on  Woodstock.
BUFFY: I know you all think it's just a big, dumb, girly thing, but it's not. Some of the skaters are Olympic  medal winners and my dad buys me  cotton candy, a different stuffed  animal wearing fuzzy skates every year and okay it is a big, dumb, girly thing, but I love it.
OZ: Not so girly. Ice is cool. It's water. But it's not.
WILLOW: I think it's sweet you and your dad have a tradition, 'specially now that he's not around so much. (beat) Ixnay on the caramel corn if you're goin' backstage...
XANDER: (to Buffy) Okay, but we're still talking party, right? I mean, some of us relish celebrating the birth of the Buf.
BUFFY: Maybe it's time to call a moratorium on parties in my honor. They tend to  go badly. Monsters crash, people die...
WILLOW: Eighteen is a big one, Buffy. You can vote now. You can be drafted. You can vote <u>not</u> to be drafted.
BUFFY: Still, I think maybe I'll just  celebrate this one with quiet reflection.
XANDER: Where's it written quiet reflection can't be combined with cake and  funny hats?
JOYCE: Buffy?
BUFFY: Present. (sees arrangement) Oo, presents!
JOYCE: (concerned) They're not... They're from your father.
JOYCE: His quarterly projections are  unraveling and he can't afford  to take off right now. He promises he'll make it up to you. It's all there  in the note...
JOYCE: If you want, I could ask someone  to cover for me at the gallery. I  mean, if you want me to take you...
JOYCE: Do you want me to go?
BUFFY: That's okay. Really. I was thinking earlier how nice it would be to have a quiet birthday.
TRAVERS: How much longer, Hobson?
HOBSON: Five, maybe six hours, sir.
TRAVERS: Once you've finished, you and Blair can get some rest... (a warning) ... but sleep in shifts.
TRAVERS: We're getting very close...
BUFFY: I mean, I know there's cartoon  characters but they also do pieces from ballets and operas... Brian  Boitano in Carmen, it's a life changer... He doesn't actually play Carmen... But a lot of sophisticated people go.
GILES: I thought we'd start with the  Grounding Crystal again.
BUFFY: ... it's the kind of thing fathers do with their daughters...
GILES: Now, look very carefully for the tiny  flaw at its core.
BUFFY: I mean if someone were free they'd  take their daughter or their... student... (still nothing from Giles; sotto) ... or their Slayer...
GILES: Buffy, I think we need to concentrate  now.
GILES: Look for the flaw at its center.
GILES: Buffy?
BUFFY: What? Did I zone on you? Sorry, must be this flu-bug I'm nursing.
GILES: Best take care of that. Why don't  you...
BUFFY: Call it a night. Good idea. See ya'.
GILES: Good night.
BUFFY: How goes it with Amy the rat?
WILLOW: Good. She really likes the new  exercise wheel. When she runs, her little nose wiggles so happily...
BUFFY: I meant, how goes it with changing  her back into a human being?
WILLOW: Oh. Still working on it. But I did get her the cutest little bell -
CORDELIA: Came to my senses. And the big deal is...?
GUY: You made me look like some  kind of dork in front of my posse.
CORDELIA: First of all, "posse?" Passe. Second, anyone with a teaspoon of brain would know not to take my flirting seriously. Especially, with my extenuating circumstances.
GUY: What circumstances?
CORDELIA: Rebound. Look it up.
CORDELIA: Hey!
GUY: I'm not through here.
BUFFY: I beg to differ.
CORDELIA: (to Guy) What is wrong with you?
GUY: The chick started it.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) Are you okay?
BUFFY: Okay, I just got swatted down by  some no-neck and rescued by Cordelia. What the hell is happening, Giles?
GILES: All right. Calm yourself.
BUFFY: Are you getting the big picture here? I have no strength. No coordination. I throw knives like... like...
GILES: A girl?
BUFFY: Like I'm not the Slayer.
GILES: Nasty bruise.
BUFFY: Should see the one farther south.
GILES: Buffy, I assure you, given time, we'll get to the bottom of whatever's causing this... anomaly.
BUFFY: Promise me?
GILES: I give you my word.
GILES: You know, I've always had nothing  but the utmost respect for the council. I've followed their dictates to the letter. But this...
TRAVERS: The Cruciamentum is not easy. For  slayer or watcher. But it's been done  this way for a dozen centuries.  Whenever a slayer turns eighteen. It's a time-honored rite of passage-
GILES: (cutting him off) It's an antiquated exercise in cruelty. Locking her in this tomb... weakened, defenseless... (re: Kralik's crate) unleashing <u>that </u>on her. (then) If any one of the council still had  actual contact with a slayer they'd see. But <u>I'm</u> the one in the thick of it.
TRAVERS: Which is why you're not qualified to make this decision. You're too close.
GILES: I'm not. No test is necessary of  her - especially not one as...  as perverse as this. (then) I'm appealing to you as a friend and colleague, Quentin. I know you can  put a stop to it.
TRAVERS: I'm sorry. A slayer must be more than physical prowess. She must have cunning, imagination... a  confidence derived from self-reliance. Believe me, once this is all over - your  Buffy will be stronger for it.
GILES: Or she'll be dead for it.
TRAVERS: Rupert...
TRAVERS: If this girl's everything you say, then you've nothing to worry about.
HOBSON: (to Travers) Sir, if you can spare me for a short spell, I'll need to make a run to the  hardware store. I just need -
TRAVERS: Take care of it.
TRAVERS: Come on! Come on!
BLAIR: Kralik. Your pills. Open your mouth.
TRAVERS: That's enough. Close it up.
BLAIR: Are you sure he's containable?
TRAVERS: I am. As long as we give him his medicine...
TRAVERS: And the opportunity to kill a slayer.
WILLOW: Aha! A curse on slayers - oh, no, wait. It's "lawyers."
XANDER: Maybe we're on the wrong track  with the spells, curses and whammies. Maybe what we should be looking for is something like slayer kryptonite.
OZ: Faulty metaphor. Kryptonite kills.
XANDER: (recovering comic book geek mode) You're assuming I meant green  kryptonite. I was referring, of course, to red kryptonite which drains Superman of his powers.
OZ: Wrong, gold kryptonite's the power- sucker. Red kryptonite's the one  that mutates Superman into weird -
BUFFY: Guys!
BUFFY: Reality.
WILLOW: Buffy, I know you're definitely, without a doubt, going to get your  powers back...
BUFFY: Thanks, Will.
WILLOW: But - what if you don't?
WILLOW: I mean, there's a slight, eensy  possibility and it just seems like, maybe, it's a good thing to get on out there and discuss. Just in case. Right?
BUFFY: Okay. If I don't' get my powers  back - I don't. I'll deal.
WILLOW: On the short side for a discussion. But okay.
BUFFY: I mean, there's a plus side to being a regular girl. The whole not-bleeding- and-killing-and-dying experience.
WILLOW: As for example.
BUFFY: Then there's the buying outfits without  worrying if they're good for bleeding- and-killing-and-dying in. There's a lot of good to it.
WILLOW: Actually, it could really open up-
BUFFY: Did you find out... anything?
GILES: Not yet.
HOBSON: It's your shift.
BLAIR: It's coming!
KRALIK: Pills!
BLAIR: Take them.
KRALIK: Pills!
BLAIR: They're right in front of you!
KRALIK: Where?
BLAIR: Here.
KRALIK: Can't see... Can't reach it...
BLAIR: Open your ey-
KRALIK: Shhh... Everything's okay now...
BUFFY: Angel. Thank you. It's beautiful.
ANGEL: You really like it?
BUFFY: Of course I do. It's thoughtful and sweet and, uh, full of neat words to learn and say like "wilt" and "henceforth..."
ANGEL: (kindly) Then why did you seem more excited last year when you got a severed arm in a box?
BUFFY: I'm sorry. Really - I love the book. And I love what you wrote. (then) It's just... Suddenly, there's this  chance that my calling could be a wrong number. I guess it's freaking me out a little.
ANGEL: That's understandable.
BUFFY: What if I have lost my powers, Angel? I mean, for good?
ANGEL: You lived a long time without them. You can do it again.
BUFFY: I guess. (then) But what if I can't? I've seen too  much now. I <u>know</u> what goes bump  in the night. Not being able to fight  it - what if I just hide under my bed, all scared and helpless... (worse thought) Or what if I just get pathetic? Hanging out at "The Old Slayer's  Home" - talking people's ears off about my glory days... showing them Mr. Pointy, the stake I had bronzed...
ANGEL: Buffy. You couldn't be helpless or boring.  Not even if you tried.
BUFFY: Oh, don't be so sure. Before I became the Slayer I was... well I don't want to say shallow, but... let's just say a  certain person who shall remain nameless, let's call her "Spordelia", looked like a  classical philosopher next to me. If I'm  not the Slayer, I mean... what do I have  to offer? (quietly) Why would you like me?
BUFFY: What?
ANGEL: I watched you, I saw you called. It was a bright afternoon, out in front of your school, you walked down the steps and I loved you.
BUFFY: Why?
ANGEL: Because I could see your heart. You held it before you for everyone to  see and I worried that it would be  bruised or torn. More than anything in my life I wanted to keep it safe, to warm it with my own.
BUFFY: That's beautiful.
BUFFY: Or, taken literally, incredibly gross.
ANGEL: I was just thinking that too.
KRALIK: You're up. I was afraid I drained you too much. I do that sometimes.
KRALIK: Ever have a tune that you can't get out of your head? Playing over and  over and over? Drives me nuts.
KRALIK: Thank you. That's much better.
KRALIK: It's a game, you know. We're not going to play by their rules... But that doesn't mean we're not going to play. Call in your friend... and  we'll discuss it over dinner.
GILES: (calling out) Quentin?
GILES: Hello? Quentin? Hob-
GUY: Hey, sweet girl... how much for a lapdance for me and my buddy?
BUFFY: (self-mocking) "Walk me home? Don't be silly, Angel. I can take care of myself."
BUFFY: Hummers - big turnoff. I like guys who remember the lyrics.
KRALIK: Wish I could. But my mind's not  what it used to be.
BUFFY: Let me go.
KRALIK: Didn't say please.
BUFFY: Help! Somebody help me!
BUFFY: Help me please!
BUFFY: Stop! Please! I need-
BUFFY: (pleading) Stop!!!
GILES: Hurry!
BUFFY: I... couldn't... couldn't fight them... I was...
GILES: Don't speak.
BUFFY: I was helpless...
BUFFY: I hit him... it felt like my arm was broken, it hurt so much... Giles, I can't be... just a person, I can't be helpless like that... We have to find out what's  happening to me.
GILES: It's an organic compound of muscle relaxants, adrenal suppressors... The effect is temporary. You'll be yourself again in a few days.
GILES: A mesmerizing crystal. Stare at it for more than a few seconds and  it puts one in a deep trance. While you were... under, I-
BUFFY: (in a stunned haze) You...
GILES: It's a test, Buffy. The Tento di  Cruciamentum. It's given to slayers when they reach - if they reach  their eighteenth birthday.
GILES: The Slayer is disabled then  entrapped with a vampire foe whom she's to defeat in order to pass. (pacing) The vampire you were to face  has escaped. His name is Zackary Kralik. As a human, he'd murdered, tortured, more than a dozen young  women before being committed to a sanitarium for the criminally insane when a vamp-
BUFFY: You bastard! All this time you saw what it was doing to me. All this time and you didn't say a word!
GILES: I wanted to...
BUFFY: Liar!
GILES: In matters of tradition and protocol, I have to answer to the Council.
GILES: My role in this was specific... I was to administer the injections, then direct you to the old boarding house on Prescott Lane-
BUFFY: I can't hear this, I can't...
GILES: Buffy, please -
BUFFY: Who are you? How could you do this to me?
GILES: (reaches for her arm) I'm deeply sorry, Buffy, you have to understand-
BUFFY: If you touch me I'll kill you.
GILES: You have to listen to me. Because I have told you this, the test is invalidated. You'll be safe, I promise. Whatever I have to do, to deal with  Kralik and to win back your trust -
BUFFY: You stuck a needle in me. You  poisoned me.
CORDELIA: What's going on?
CORDELIA: Oh god. Is the world ending? I have  to research a paper on Bosnia for  tomorrow but if the world's ending  I'm not gonna bother.
GILES: Buffy you can't walk home alone - It isn't safe!
BUFFY: I don't know you.
CORDELIA: Did something take her memory? (to Buffy) He's Giles. (pronouncing it) Ji-ylls. He hangs out here a lot.
BUFFY: Cordelia... could you please drive  me home?
CORDELIA: Of course.
CORDELIA: But if the world doesn't end, I'm gonna need a note.
JOYCE: (alarmed) Buffy...?
KRALIK: Mother.
BUFFY: (concerned) Mom?
GILES: I've been trying to reach you.
TRAVERS: I was on watch, by the boarding house.
GILES: Then you know what's happened.
TRAVERS: Yes.
GILES: He's killed Hobson. And made Blair  his own - your perfectly controlled  test has spun rather impressively out of control, don't you think?
TRAVERS: It changes nothing.
GILES: Then allow me. I've told Buffy everything.
TRAVERS: That is in direct opposition to the council's orders.
GILES: Yes - interestingly enough, I don't give a rat's ass about the council's  orders. There will be no test.
TRAVERS: The test has already begun.
TRAVERS: Your slayer entered the field of play  about ten minutes ago.
GILES: Why...?
TRAVERS: I don't know - I returned there just  as she entered.
TRAVERS: Giles, we have no business interfering -
GILES: This isn't business.
KRALIK: Why did you come to the dark of the wood...
KRALIK: ... to bring all these sweets to grandmother's house.
KRALIK: A little lower... there.
KRALIK: If you stray from the path you  will lose your way.
KRALIK: I won't take it all, I won't take it all...
JOYCE: Buffy?
JOYCE: Buffy, we have to get-
KRALIK: Where are they?! <b>Where are they?!?</b>
KRALIK: You almost got away little girl. I almost lay down and -
KRALIK: What did you... My pills...
BUFFY: If I had the Slayer's power... I'd  be punning right about now.
JOYCE: Buffy, thank God you're okay.  That man...
BUFFY: I can't get these. They're too tight.
BUFFY: Not right now. Maybe there's some clippers-
JOYCE: Buffy!
TRAVERS: You exhibited extraordinary courage and clearheadedness in battle. The  council is very pleased.
BUFFY: Do I get a gold star?
TRAVERS: I understand that you're upset -
BUFFY: You understand nothing. You set that  monster loose and he came after my  <b>mother</b>.
TRAVERS: You think the test was unfair?
BUFFY: I think you better get out of town  before I get my strength back.
TRAVERS: We're not in the business of 'fair', Miss Summers. We're fighting a war.
GILES: You're <b>waging</b> a war. She's fighting it. There is a difference.
TRAVERS: Mr. Giles, if you don't mind-
GILES: The test is done. We're finished.
TRAVERS: Not quite. She passed. You didn't.
TRAVERS: The Slayer isn't the only one who must perform in this situation. I have  recommended to the council, and they  have agreed, that you be relieved of  your duties as watcher effective  immediately. You're fired.
GILES: On what grounds?
TRAVERS: Your affection for your charge has  rendered you incapable of clear and  impartial judgment. You have a father's love for the child and that is useless to the cause.
TRAVERS: It would be best for you not to have further contact with the Slayer-
GILES: I'm not going anywhere.
TRAVERS: No, well, I didn't expect you to adhere to that. However, if you interfere with  the new watcher or try to countermand his authority in any way you will be dealt  with. Are we clear.
GILES: We're very clear.
TRAVERS: (to Buffy) Congratulations again.
BUFFY: Bite me.
TRAVERS: (turning to go) Yes. Well. Colorful girl.
BUFFY: Ow!
GILES: Let me see...
WILLOW: I just can't believe Giles was fired! How could Giles get fired?
OZ: So how did you manage to kill Kralik?
JOYCE: Oh, she was very clever. (off Buffy's look) You go ahead and tell it, dear. You tell  it better.
WILLOW: But when you say fired, you mean fired?
XANDER: You're not cruising past that concept anytime soon, are you?
WLLOW: It's just-he's been fired! He's  unemployed! He's between jobs!
BUFFY: Giles isn't going anywhere, Will. He's still librarian.
WILLOW: Okay, but I'm writing an angry letter.
BUFFY: Nothing's really gonna change. The important thing is, I kept up my  special birthday tradition of gut- wrenching misery and horror.
OZ: Bright side to everything.
BUFFY: Things won't ever be exactly the same, but once I... get back to... full...
XANDER: Give you a hand with that, little lady?
BUFFY: You're loving this far too much.
XANDER: Admit it. Sometimes you just need  a big strong...
