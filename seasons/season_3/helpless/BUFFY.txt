Gotchya.
Satisfied?
Well, I didn't mean satisfied  like-
'Cause we're not having satisfaction,  in the personal sense...
(gathering her stuff) I should take off. Giles is -
Thanks. For the work out.
Birthday, right. Actually, yeah, I do  have a thing.
(smiling) Nice attempt at casual. It is a date.  Older man. Very handsome. Likes it  when I call him "Daddy."
He's taking me to the ice show. It's  great fun. And I could definitely use  a little more fun.
Amethyst.
(stumped) Breath mint?
Okay, so: how do you know when your aura's dirty? Somebody come  by with a finger and write "wash me"  on it?
Sorry. I just figure with Faith on one  of her unannounced walkabouts someone should be out patrolling.
I hate being the "good" one.
Let's just say I've got a lot of energy  to burn off.
Wow, that was really funny looking. Could you do that again?
For that? What were you trying to  kill me for before?
Giles, something's wrong.
On top of that, I got a bad case of the  dizzies last night and almost let a vamp  stake me. With my own stake!  (throws again, wide) I am way off my game, my game's  left the country, it's in Cuernavaca,  what's going on here?
Oh, no. Not sick. I can't get sick.
No, my father's coming up to take  me to the ice show. We do it every year for my birthday. If I cancel on  him, it'll break his heart.
No, no - I think I need to spend a  little more time training...
I'm gone.
I know you all think it's just a big, dumb, girly thing, but it's not. Some of the skaters are Olympic  medal winners and my dad buys me  cotton candy, a different stuffed  animal wearing fuzzy skates every year and okay it is a big, dumb, girly thing, but I love it.
Maybe it's time to call a moratorium on parties in my honor. They tend to  go badly. Monsters crash, people die...
Still, I think maybe I'll just  celebrate this one with quiet reflection.
Present. (sees arrangement) Oo, presents!
That's okay. Really. I was thinking earlier how nice it would be to have a quiet birthday.
I mean, I know there's cartoon  characters but they also do pieces from ballets and operas... Brian  Boitano in Carmen, it's a life changer... He doesn't actually play Carmen... But a lot of sophisticated people go.
... it's the kind of thing fathers do with their daughters...
I mean if someone were free they'd  take their daughter or their... student... (still nothing from Giles; sotto) ... or their Slayer...
What? Did I zone on you? Sorry, must be this flu-bug I'm nursing.
Call it a night. Good idea. See ya'.
How goes it with Amy the rat?
I meant, how goes it with changing  her back into a human being?
I beg to differ.
Okay, I just got swatted down by  some no-neck and rescued by Cordelia. What the hell is happening, Giles?
Are you getting the big picture here? I have no strength. No coordination. I throw knives like... like...
Like I'm not the Slayer.
Should see the one farther south.
Promise me?
Guys!
Reality.
Thanks, Will.
Okay. If I don't' get my powers  back - I don't. I'll deal.
I mean, there's a plus side to being a regular girl. The whole not-bleeding- and-killing-and-dying experience.
Then there's the buying outfits without  worrying if they're good for bleeding- and-killing-and-dying in. There's a lot of good to it.
Did you find out... anything?
Angel. Thank you. It's beautiful.
Of course I do. It's thoughtful and sweet and, uh, full of neat words to learn and say like "wilt" and "henceforth..."
I'm sorry. Really - I love the book. And I love what you wrote. (then) It's just... Suddenly, there's this  chance that my calling could be a wrong number. I guess it's freaking me out a little.
What if I have lost my powers, Angel? I mean, for good?
I guess. (then) But what if I can't? I've seen too  much now. I <u>know</u> what goes bump  in the night. Not being able to fight  it - what if I just hide under my bed, all scared and helpless... (worse thought) Or what if I just get pathetic? Hanging out at "The Old Slayer's  Home" - talking people's ears off about my glory days... showing them Mr. Pointy, the stake I had bronzed...
Oh, don't be so sure. Before I became the Slayer I was... well I don't want to say shallow, but... let's just say a  certain person who shall remain nameless, let's call her "Spordelia", looked like a  classical philosopher next to me. If I'm  not the Slayer, I mean... what do I have  to offer? (quietly) Why would you like me?
What?
Why?
That's beautiful.
Or, taken literally, incredibly gross.
(self-mocking) "Walk me home? Don't be silly, Angel. I can take care of myself."
Hummers - big turnoff. I like guys who remember the lyrics.
Let me go.
Help! Somebody help me!
Help me please!
Stop! Please! I need-
(pleading) Stop!!!
I... couldn't... couldn't fight them... I was...
I was helpless...
I hit him... it felt like my arm was broken, it hurt so much... Giles, I can't be... just a person, I can't be helpless like that... We have to find out what's  happening to me.
(in a stunned haze) You...
You bastard! All this time you saw what it was doing to me. All this time and you didn't say a word!
Liar!
I can't hear this, I can't...
Who are you? How could you do this to me?
If you touch me I'll kill you.
You stuck a needle in me. You  poisoned me.
I don't know you.
Cordelia... could you please drive  me home?
(concerned) Mom?
If I had the Slayer's power... I'd  be punning right about now.
I can't get these. They're too tight.
Not right now. Maybe there's some clippers-
Do I get a gold star?
You understand nothing. You set that  monster loose and he came after my  <b>mother</b>.
I think you better get out of town  before I get my strength back.
Bite me.
Ow!
Giles isn't going anywhere, Will. He's still librarian.
Nothing's really gonna change. The important thing is, I kept up my  special birthday tradition of gut- wrenching misery and horror.
Things won't ever be exactly the same, but once I... get back to... full...
You're loving this far too much.
