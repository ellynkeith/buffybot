WILLOW: This is a nightmare. This is... my world is spinning.
XANDER: Will, it's not that bad. Really.
WILLOW: Seven-forty verbal? That's.. I'm pathetic. Illiterate! I'm Cletus the slack-jawed yokel.
XANDER: That's right. And the fact that your seven forty verbal closely resembles my combined scores in no way compromises your position as the village idiot.
WILLOW: I just... where did I go wrong?
XANDER: (softly) You did amazing, Willow. As usual.
CORDELIA: You guys get your scores?
XANDER: Cordelia! Willow is very sad. From her academic failure and how did you do?
XANDER: This is not good.
CORDELIA: What's not good?
XANDER: I'm just worried it may hurt my standing as campus stud when people find out I'm dating a BRAIN.
CORDELIA: Please. I have some experience in covering these things up.
OZ: Yeah, I can see why you'd be upset. (off their looks) That was my sarcastic voice.
XANDER: Sounds a lot like your regular voice.
OZ: I've been told that. But I'm thinking we should celebrate. Do something.
CORDELIA: Like, the four of us?
XANDER: Double date... Could have potential...
WILLOW: Buffy! Hey, did you get your SAT scores?
XANDER: And from the look on your face, I suspect that we'll be manning the drive-thru side by side.
BUFFY: These scores -- what do they really mean?
WILLOW: Fourteen-thirty combined?! Buffy, you kicked ass!
WILLOW: Okay, so academic achievement gets me a little excited.
XANDER: Buff, that's amazing!
CORDELIA: Let me see that.
OZ: Scores like that, you can apply pretty much anywhere you want.
WILLOW: This could, like, change your whole future.
BUFFY: That thought had occurred to me...
XANDER: Then why the long face?
BUFFY: I don't know. I guess... My future. Never really thought about it. Wasn't sure I was gonna have one.
CORDELIA: I think it's great. Now you can leave and never come back. (off looks) I mean in a positive way! Get out of Sunnydale, that's a good thing! I mean, what kind of moron would ever want to come back here?
SPIKE: Home sweet... home...
SPIKE: (sings) Mistakes... I've made a few... I ate it up... and spit it out... and did it my way...
SPIKE: Home...
SPIKE: Drusilla... I'm home...
SPIKE: Why'd you do it, baby? Why'd you leave me? We were happy here...
SPIKE: You stupid, worthless bitch! Look what you've done to me!
SPIKE: All right. Enough moping. Who can I kill?
XANDER: Come on, it'll be fun.
CORDELIA: I don't know. I thought we were gonna do something, you know, classy.
XANDER: What's classier than bowling?
CORDELIA: Apart from everything ever? Let's see...
XANDER: Oz and Willow are down. You're the swing vote. I guarantee fun.
XANDER: Hey. Those are from the pier.
CORDELIA: Yeah, I just got them developed.
XANDER: There's pictures. Of me. On your locker.
CORDELIA: So?
CORDELIA: I put them there because I want to see your face between classes, get it? So thinking of us together makes me... I don't know... HAPPY, okay? Is that such a big deal?
XANDER: For ME, big deal. Never knew I was locker door material.
CORDELIA: Well... just barely. Besides, I look really cute in those pictures.
WILLOW: Hey, guys!
OZ: What's the verdict? Do we bowl?
CORDELIA: We bowl.
WILLOW: A double bowling date! I'm on Oz's team.
XANDER: Yeah, well, prepare to be crushed. (to Cordy) Maybe we should practice...
WILLOW: They haven't got a prayer. I'm really good -- or I was when we had those inflatable things in the gutters... what's this?
OZ: Gift.
WILLOW: What's the occasion?
OZ: Pretty much you are.
WILLOW: It's a little witch Pez!
OZ: Kind of a theme present. Do you like it?
WILLOW: I like. I MORE than like... This... Oz, this might be the nicest... We need to find a Pez WEREWOLF. Then Pez witch can have a boyfriend!
OZ: Hmm. Never seen a werewolf Pez. Might have to settle for a wacky cartoon dog.
WILLOW: (starting to well up) This is so thoughtful...
OZ: Well, I think about you.
WILLOW: And I don't have anything to give you.
OZ: Yes you do.
GILES: Buffy. This is remarkable.
BUFFY: So is this... Where IS this retreat thing -- the Yukon?
GILES: It's quite nearby. The clearing at the top of Breaker's Woods. Site of some fascinating Druidic rituals.
BUFFY: Okay, but it's just a few days, right? You're not gonna settle there and grow crops or anything.
GILES: What? My gear? I'm only bringing the basic necessities.
BUFFY: Giles, you pack like me.
GILES: Here. I suspect your mother will want to put this on your refrigerator.
BUFFY: Oh yeah. She saw these scores, her head spun around and exploded.
GILES: (wearily) I've been on this Hellmouth for too long. That was metaphorical, yes?
BUFFY: Yes. She was happy. Started up with all kinds of crazy talk about me going to college, maybe going somewhere... else...
BUFFY: I know, I told her you'd have a goat, I mean, responsibilities and all, I know the drill --
GILES: She may he right.
BUFFY: Yeah, I figured you'd -- (stops) Whoakay. Be kind, rewind. May be right?
GILES: With scores like these, you could get a first rate education. Buffy, I'm not going to ask you to ignore your calling, but you do need to look to your future. And with Faith here, it may be that you could move on, at least for a time.
BUFFY: Wow.
GILES: We'll discuss it when I get back. While I'm gone I'll expect you to keep up on your training. And don't do anything rash.
BUFFY: Anything rash meaning...?
GILES: (a little uncomfortable) Are you planning to see Angel?
BUFFY: (gets his meaning) Well, yeah, but Giles, there's not gonna be any rash. Anywhere. We're friends, and that's all either of us wants. Nothing's gonna happen.
WILLOW: Something's gonna happen.
XANDER: Like what?
WILLOW: It's a mistake. It's a terrible, fatal mistake. I see that now.
XANDER: It's bowling.
WILLOW: It's bad bowling. It's a double date with all of us and they're gonna know!
XANDER: How are they gonna know?
WILLOW: It's a very intimate situation, it's all sexy with the smoke and the sweating and the shoe rental --
XANDER: You're turned on by rented shoes?
WILLOW: (looking down) That's not the issue.
XANDER: Okay, well, let me ask you this: what are they gonna know? That we're friends, old old friends and maybe we had one or two indiscretions but that's all past, we're just very good friends that like to hang out and can I kiss your earlobe?
WILLOW: No! Well, okay. No!
WILLOW: Pez!
XANDER: Bowling may be a bit too much to handle. Man. (lets go) I wish I wasn't so attracted to you. I wish we could just make it stop.
WILLOW: Any suggestions?
JOYCE: Carnegie Mellon has a wonderful design curriculum. And Brown University's history program is... You like history, right?
BUFFY: Couldn't we do this another time? This whole day, everyone's like, "Congratulations. Go away."
JOYCE: That's not it. It's just -- You should be at a good old-fashioned college, with keg parties and boys. Not here, with Hellmouths and vampires.
BUFFY: Not really seeing a huge distinction there...
JOYCE: You're always talking about how you wish you could lead a more normal life. Well, this is your chance.
BUFFY: It's not that simple, Mom. I have responsibilities.
JOYCE: I know, I know. But I spoke with Mr. Giles, and he said --
BUFFY: That Faith could be Miss Sunnydale in the Slayer pageant. I know.
JOYCE: It's time to think about the future, Buffy. About your whole life. I mean honestly, is there anything keeping you here?
SPIKE: Yeah, you... you think I'm afraid of you? We were happy, you brainwashed her... I can just --
SPIKE: Yeah. I'll show you who's... cool guy. You're going down.
SPIKE: Ack! Blahng!
SPIKE: This is just too much.
CLERK: I know you'll enjoy that.
CLERK: Oh! Did you come in through the back?
SPIKE: Yeah. I need a curse.
CLERK: A what?
SPIKE: A curse! Something nasty -- boils. I wanna give him boils. All over his face, dripping pustules, let's really go for the gusto here.
CLERK: I'm hearing a lot of negative energy and I'll bet --
SPIKE: Leprosy! A spell that makes his parts fall off, that sounds proper.
CLERK: We don't, uh, carry leprosy. Would you excuse me a moment?
CLERK: Blessed be. Anything in particular I can help you find?
WILLOW: Yeah. It's all on here. Let's see, skink root, essence of rose thorn, a couple canary feathers...
CLERK: Ah-hah. A lust spell. I'll need to see some I.D.
CLERK: (laughing) Just kidding, just kidding. Love spell. Want that old lover to come back to you. You sure you know what you're doing, hon?
WILLOW: No! I mean... yes. I mean, I know how to do a love spell... but this is for an ANTI-love spell. Kind of a delusting. I guess, the supplies are basically the same, huh?
CLERK: Basically. Though raven feathers tend to breed more discontent than the canary.
WILLOW: Oh. Okay.
CLERK: Let me just grab some of these things...
CLERK: Fifteen eighty three for the lot. Oh! The raven feathers. Well, I'll throw them in for free.
WILLOW: Thank you.
CLERK: Now, an anti-attraction spell is just as difficult as a love spell. You be careful.
WILLOW: I will.
CLERK: Blessed be!
WILLOW: Blessed... yeah. You too.
CLERK: So, did you find a spell book?
SPIKE: Forget the book.
SPIKE: I just got a better idea.
MAYOR: Look at that. Every time, cuts to the left. And it's not the carpet. It's me.
MAYOR: I swear, I would sell my soul for a decent short game. (chuckles) Of course, it's a little late for that... Don't suppose I could offer YOUR soul? Really help me on the green...
MAYOR: I'm just funnin'. So, we have a Spike problem, do we?
MAYOR: He's been spotted back in town. And there was an incident at a magic shop -- in broad daylight. The police had a hell of a time covering it up.
MAYOR: (fondly) Well, yes, he got up to all sorts of shenanigans last year. Had a world of fun just trying to guess what he'd do next! Funny guy.
MAYOR: I remember.
MAYOR: But I guess we're past that, now. This year is too important to let a loose cannon rock the boat.
MAYOR: Should I have Mr. Trick send a... committee to deal with this?
MAYOR: Loose cannon. Rock the boat. Now is that a mixed metaphor?
MAYOR: Uh, I don't know...
MAYOR: Boats did have cannons. And a loose one would cause it to rock... Honestly, I don't know where my mind goes sometimes. Why don't you take care of this Spike problem. A committee, like you said.
MAYOR: It's good as done.
MAYOR: That's swell. Fore!
ANGEL: College.
BUFFY: Higher education. Kind of an intense proposition.
ANGEL: Where do you want to go?
BUFFY: Oh, I don't even know. Mom's just so pumped, she grabbed all of these. She can't stop talking about it -- I had a really hard time coming up with an alibi to get over here.
ANGEL: (realizes) She doesn't know about me.
BUFFY: Big no. She's having enough trouble dealing with the Slayer issue; I don't think she's ready to process the information about us being... friends again.
BUFFY: I think the whole college jones is kind of her reacting to the Slayer thing.
ANGEL: She wants you to get out.
BUFFY: Somewhere a little less hellmouthy. And she has a point... but there's reasons to stay, too.
ANGEL: What are they?
BUFFY: Well, uh, you know, Slayer duties, and... what do you think I should do?
ANGEL: As a friend... I think you should leave. This is a good opportunity.
BUFFY: Yeah. Well, 'cause there really isn't any great reason to stay, I guess.
BUFFY: Thanks for the advice. Another perspective to weigh in there. I better get back.
ANGEL: It's early.
BUFFY: Yeah, but Mom... she starts worrying a lot earlier these days. I'll stop by soon.
XANDER: Whoah. It smells like church in here. No, wait... EVIL church.
WILLOW: It's just chemistry stuff. An experiment.
XANDER: So you said when you called. Why do I have to be here?
WILLOW: It'll help you with the exam. You're WAY behind.
XANDER: But that's what you love about me, right? Academically dangerous.
WILLOW: Here. Hold this.
XANDER: Feather. And who will I be tickling?
WILLOW: Shush. (to herself) Okay... bring mixture to a boil...
XANDER: I assume all this won't make us late for our evening of bowling magic?
WILLOW: (mild panic) Magic? There's no magic! I mean... bowling. Yeah. Cordelia and Oz are going to meet us here later.
XANDER: Can't we turn on the lights? (then) Is that a spell book?
WILLOW: No, no, no. CHEMISTRY book.
XANDER: Wait a minute... we HAVE deja-vu... This is love spell stuff! Are you doing a love spell?
WILLOW: No! Of course not! This is a purely scientific... (the gig is up) De-lusting spell. For us. I thought it would go easier if you didn't know.
XANDER: Are you nuts? In case you've forgotten, I tend to have bad luck with these sorts of spells.
WILLOW: (guiltily) You SAID you wished these feelings could just go away.
XANDER: I wish lots of things. I told you I wished I was a fireman in sixth grade, but you never followed through on THAT!
WILLOW: I can't do this anymore Xander! This whole "us" thing is just... BLEAGHH!
XANDER: Fine! No more kissing. I'm with you.
WILLOW: It's not just the kissing. It's the groping and the squeezing and the panting, and EVERYTHING that feels really good... until I think about Oz and then it feels really bad. (holds up PEZ) He gave me PEZ, Xander! Even YOU never gave me Pez!
XANDER: Exactly. You've got Oz and Pez, I've got Cordy... and well, I've got Cordy. So do we really need to resort to the BLACK ARTS to keep our hormones in check?
WILLOW: At this moment? I'm thinking no.
XANDER: Where's the lights?
XANDER: We gotta clean this up before they get here and start asking questions.
WILLOW: Xander!
SPIKE: I need to borrow the little girl. You don't mind, do you?
SPIKE: (tipsiness showing) Are you threatening me? Not nice. We're all gonna be very best friends.
SPIKE: A spell. For me. You're gonna do a spell for me.
WILLOW: Um, what... kind of spell...?
SPIKE: (really bellows) A love spell! Are you brain dead?
SPIKE: I'm gonna get what's mine. What's MINE. Teach her to walk out on me... what are you staring at?
WILLOW: Nothing.
SPIKE: You can do it, right? Make Dru love me again? Make her crawl?
WILLOW: I... I can try...
SPIKE: What are you talking to me about trying? You'll do it!
WILLOW: Yes! I'll do it!
SPIKE: You lie to me, I'll shove this through your face! Do you want that? All the way through to your brain!
WILLOW: No... please... no...
SPIKE: She wouldn't even kill me.
SPIKE: She just left. She didn't even care enough to cut off my head, or light me on fire. Was that so much to ask? Some little sign that she cared?
SPIKE: It was that truce with Buffy that did it. Dru said I'd gone soft; wasn't demon enough for the likes of her. I said it didn't mean anything, I was thinking of her the whole time; she didn't care. We got to Brazil and she was just different, just... I gave her everything... jewels, beautiful dresses -- with beautiful girls in them, nothing made her happy. And she would flirt... I caught her on a park bench making out with a Chaos Demon -- have you ever seen a Chaos Demon? They're all slime and antlers, they're disgusting; she only did it to hurt me... I said I wasn't putting up with it anymore, she said fine, I said, yeah, I've got an unlife, you know... and she said... she said we could still be friends! Oh-God, I'm so unhappy!
WILLOW: There there...
SPIKE: (into her neck) Friends! How could she be so cruel?
SPIKE: Mmmmm... your neck, that smell...
SPIKE: I haven't had a woman in weeks --
WILLOW: Whoah! No! Hold it!
SPIKE: Well, unless you count that shopkeeper...
WILLOW: Now hold on! I'll do your spell, and, and, I'll get you Drusilla back but there's no bottles in the face and there's no "having"! Of any kind! With me. All right?
SPIKE: All right. Get started.
WILLOW: I'm not a real witch, you know. I'm not... sure it'll work right away.
SPIKE: Well, if at first you don't succeed, (re: Xander) I kill him and you try again.
WILLOW: This... isn't enough.
SPIKE: What?
WILLOW: There's other ingredients. And I need a book, a spell book. This isn't it.
SPIKE: You've got one, though? At home?
WILLOW: Not at home... I left it somewhere...
SPIKE: Where?
CORDELIA: Oh, thank god. You ARE here.
BUFFY: Not all of us have dates tonight.
OZ: Something's up.
CORDELIA: We were supposed to meet them here. I don't know what could have happened...
BUFFY: What is all this stuff? Cause I'm thinking WEIRD science.
CORDELIA: Was Willow messing with her magic tricks again? Maybe they disappeared. Maybe she turned Xander into something ishy!
BUFFY: Whatever happened, there was a fight.
OZ: There's no blood.
BUFFY: Either they ran, or they were taken, or...
CORDELIA: You're having too many "Or"s! Pick one!
BUFFY: I'm not sure. I need you guys to find Giles. I'll look around -- maybe they didn't go far.
CORDELIA: Where is Giles?
BUFFY: He's at some retreat up near the clearing in Breaker's woods.
OZ: I know the spot. But it's like a 45-minute drive.
BUFFY: So motor.
BUFFY: Giles?
BUFFY: Mom. No, I'm...
JOYCE: I admit I overreacted before. You don't HAVE to go all the way across the country. I picked up some brochures on some NEARBY schools, okay?
BUFFY: That's great, mom, but now's not really...
SPIKE: So I happen to walk by, and she's making out with a Chaos Demon! And I said, you know, I don't have to put up with this, and she said, fine, and I said, fine, do whatever you want! I thought we'd make up, you know...
JOYCE: Well, she sounds very unreasonable.
SPIKE: She is! She's out of her mind! That's what I miss most about her...
JOYCE: Well, Spike, sometimes, even when two people seem right for each other, their lives just take different paths. When Buffy's father and I started having trouble --
SPIKE: But this is different! Our love was eternal! Literally! You got any of those little marshmallows?
JOYCE: Let me look.
ANGEL: Spike.
JOYCE: Oh my god. Get away from here!
SPIKE: Yeah, you're not invited!
JOYCE: (to Spike) He's crazy. He'll kill us!
SPIKE: Not while I breathe! Well, actually I don't...
ANGEL: Joyce, listen to me!
JOYCE: You get away from this house! I'll stake you myself.
SPIKE: You're a very bad man.
ANGEL: Joyce, you can't trust him. Invite me in!
ANGEL: You touch her and I'll cut your head off.
SPIKE: Yah? You and what army?
BUFFY: That would be me.
BUFFY: (eyes on Spike) Angel. Why don't you come on in.
JOYCE: Oh. No.
BUFFY: You shouldn't have come back.
SPIKE: I do what I please.
JOYCE: Okay, I'm confused again...
SPIKE: Willow!
BUFFY: You took Willow.
SPIKE: You do me now, and you'll never find the little witch.
JOYCE: Willow's a witch?
BUFFY: (to Spike) And Xander?
SPIKE: Him too.
JOYCE: Xander's a witch?
ANGEL: Where are they?
SPIKE: Doesn't work like that, peaches, and when did you become all soul-having again? I thought you outgrew that. (to Buffy) Your friend's gonna work a little magic for me. She does my spell, I let them both go.
BUFFY: You're not famous for keeping promises.
SPIKE: You and your great poof here want to tag along, fine. But get in my way, and you kill your friends.
CORDELIA: What if they were kidnapped by Colombian DRUG LORDS? They could be cutting off Xander's ear right now... Or other parts!
CORDELIA: Oz? You missed the turn.
CORDELIA: Hello?
OZ: It's Willow. She's nearby
CORDELIA: What, you can smell her? She doesn't even wear perfume.
OZ: She's afraid...
CORDELIA: Oh my god. This is a residual werewolf thing, isn't it? I think that's very disturbing.
OZ: I really agree...
SPIKE: Just need a few supplies, then I'll take you -- ohhhh...
BUFFY: What's wrong, not that I care?
SPIKE: My head. I think I'm sobering up. It's horrible. Ugh. I wish I was dead.
BUFFY: (pulling out a stake) Well, if you close your eyes and wish real hard...
SPIKE: Back off!
ANGEL: Buffy we still need him to find the others.
BUFFY: (sulkily) "Need him." He's probably just got 'em locked up in the factory.
SPIKE: How thick do you think I am?
BUFFY: All right. Let's just get this done.
SPIKE: Oh, God.
ANGEL: What?
SPIKE: (welling up) We killed a homeless man on this bench. Me and Dru. Good times... (laughs affectionately) He begged for mercy, and that just made her bite harder...
BUFFY: I guess you had to be there.
BUFFY: Your work?
SPIKE: (ignoring her) Here's the list.
BUFFY: "Essence of violet" -- Angel?
ANGEL: Right.
BUFFY: "Cloves, set of runic tablets" -- and Spike, you can find the rats eyes.
SPIKE: I used to bring her rats... With the morning paper...
BUFFY: Oh, good, more moping. That's really gonna win her back, Spike.
SPIKE: The spell's gonna get her back.
ANGEL: Lot of trouble for someone who doesn't even care about you.
SPIKE: Shut your gob.
ANGEL: She's just kind of fickle...
SPIKE: Shut up!
SPIKE: What do you know? It's your fault, the both of you! She belongs with me. (maudlin again) I'm nothing without her.
BUFFY: That one I'm gonna back up. (goes back to looking around) It's just pathetic. You're not even a loser anymore. You're a shell of a loser.
SPIKE: Yeah, and you're one to talk.
BUFFY: Meaning what?
SPIKE: Last time I looked in on you, you two were fighting to the death. Now you're back to making googly eyes at each other like nothing happened. Makes me want to heave.
BUFFY: Excuse me! There's no eye googling here.
SPIKE: Oh, sure, you're just friends.
ANGEL: That's right.
SPIKE: You're not friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it kills you both. You'll fight, you'll shag, you'll hate each other till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Real love isn't brains, children, it's blood, it's blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.
SPIKE: Eye of rat.
WILLOW: Xander!
WILLOW: Are you okay?
XANDER: Dizzy. Kinda nauseous, too. Do I remember having a fight with Spike?
WILLOW: You do.
XANDER: I won, right? I kicked his ass.
WILLOW: You were real brave...
WILLOW: Do you need to barf?
XANDER: No... I'm okay. (looks around) Where are we?
WILLOW: The factory. We're locked in the basement.
XANDER: The factory where Spike lived? Burnt out place in the middle of nothing... So we're pretty much into a "scream all you want" scenario.
WILLOW: Pretty much.
XANDER: Why didn't he just kill us?
WILLOW: He wants me to do a love spell.
XANDER: What?
WILLOW: Drusilla broke up with him.
XANDER: Gee, and we'd all hoped those crazy kids were gonna make it work.
WILLOW: He's out of control. I mean, not that he was Joe Restraint in the old days...
XANDER: So what are our options?
WILLOW: Well, I figure either I refuse to do the spell and he kills us, or I do the spell, and he kills us.
XANDER: Give me a third option.
WILLOW: He's so drunk he forgets all about us and we starve to death. That's sort of the best one.
XANDER: Willow. We're not gonna die. If he's so drunk he'll get sloppy and I'll make my move. As long as my move doesn't involve standing up or using my limbs, we'll be okay.
WILLOW: We're not supposed to...
XANDER: Exemption for Impending Death Situations.
CORDELIA: Oh, God.
XANDER: Oh, God.
WILLOW: Oh, God... Oz...
OZ: (emotionless) We have to get out of here.
XANDER: Cordy, I...
XANDER: Cordy...
XANDER: Cordelia!
CORDELIA: (dazed) I fell...
BUFFY: We got the stuff. So where are they?
SPIKE: What's your hurry?
BUFFY: My hurry is my intense desire to get you out of my life. You tend to make trouble.
SPIKE: Well, I'll be out of your life in a few short hours. No trouble at all.
LENNY: Hello, Spike.
BUFFY: No trouble at all...
SPIKE: Lenny... how've you been?
LENNY: Better since you left. You should have stayed gone.
SPIKE: Is that right?
BUFFY: You know, he was just leaving... (to Spike) Don't you start something.
SPIKE: That pissant used to work for me!
BUFFY: My friends are in trouble. We cannot risk this.
ANGEL: I don't think we have a choice.
LENNY: You other two can walk away from this.
SPIKE: (to Buffy) I die, your chums die...
BUFFY: (to Lenny) I guess we're staying.
LENNY: Not for long.
BUFFY: The window!
SPIKE: This should be a kick...
BUFFY: I violently dislike you.
XANDER: Cordy? Don't move! Oz went for help! Oh, God....
WILLOW: Don't move! Don't even talk...
WILLOW: No! That's talking! DON'T talk!
XANDER: I'm going down there.
WILLOW: It's too unstable, Xander!
XANDER: Will, she needs someone with her.
BUFFY: We have to get out of here.
ANGEL: Can we get to the roof?
BUFFY: Angel!
LENNY: Yeah, I heard you'd gone soft. Sad to see it, man.
SPIKE: Soft?
LENNY: Like baby food.
SPIKE: Well, then. Let's give Baby a taste.
ANGEL: I'm all right.
BUFFY: You're not at full strength yet.
ANGEL: That window's about to go.
BUFFY: We'll get out the back --
ANGEL: Buffy.
BUFFY: Oh, my.
SPIKE: Baby like his supper? Baby like his supper?
SPIKE: Why doesn't baby have a nap?
BUFFY: Spike... Get down.
SPIKE: Now that was fun. (off their looks) Don't tell me that wasn't fun. GOD! It's been so long since I had a decent spot of violence! (smiles contemplatively) Really puts things in perspective.
BUFFY: I got you...
SPIKE: Oh yeah. You two. Just friends. No danger there.
BUFFY: Let's just do the damn spell, all right?
SPIKE: Oh, sod the spell. Your friends are in the factory. (off her surprised look) I'm glad I came here, you know? I been all wrongheaded about this. Weeping, crawling, blaming everybody else. I want Dru back, I just have to be the man I was. The man she loved. I'm gonna do what I shoulda done in the first place. I'll find her, wherever she is... and I'll tie her up and torture her until she likes me again.
SPIKE: Love's a funny thing...
XANDER: Just hold on. Please. Hold on...
CORDELIA: Xander...
XANDER: Cordy...
CORDELIA: I can't see you...
XANDER: Cordy...
BUFFY: So, Cordy's okay.
WILLOW: Yeah. She lost a lot of blood, but no vital stuff got punctured.
BUFFY: Has she talked to Xander?
WILLOW: (shaking her head) She couldn't have visitors at first. He's going today.
BUFFY: And Oz?
WILLOW: I didn't know there was anything inside me that could feel this bad.
WILLOW: For the longest time I couldn't figure out what I wanted. I wanted everything. (a tear runs out) Now I just want Oz to talk to me again.
BUFFY: Give it some time. And get ready to grovel.
WILLOW: I'm ready. I'm all over groveling.
BUFFY: Good. You know, sometimes that can really work.
XANDER: Can I come in?
XANDER: They wouldn't let me see you till now.
XANDER: Look, Cordy, I just need you to know that --
CORDELIA: (whispers) Xander?
XANDER: Yeah?
CORDELIA: (icy) Stay away from me.
ANGEL: I wondered when you were coming.
BUFFY: I'm not coming back.
BUFFY: We're not friends. Never were. I can fool Giles, I can fool my friends, but I can't fool myself. Or Spike, for some reason. What I want from you, I can never have. You don't need me to take care of you any more, so I'm gonna go.
ANGEL: I don't accept that.
BUFFY: You have to.
ANGEL: There must be some way we can still see each other.
BUFFY: There is. Just tell me you don't love me.
