You guys get your scores?
What's not good?
Please. I have some experience in covering these things up.
Like, the four of us?
Let me see that.
I think it's great. Now you can leave and never come back. (off looks) I mean in a positive way! Get out of Sunnydale, that's a good thing! I mean, what kind of moron would ever want to come back here?
I don't know. I thought we were gonna do something, you know, classy.
Apart from everything ever? Let's see...
Yeah, I just got them developed.
So?
I put them there because I want to see your face between classes, get it? So thinking of us together makes me... I don't know... HAPPY, okay? Is that such a big deal?
Well... just barely. Besides, I look really cute in those pictures.
We bowl.
Oh, thank god. You ARE here.
We were supposed to meet them here. I don't know what could have happened...
Was Willow messing with her magic tricks again? Maybe they disappeared. Maybe she turned Xander into something ishy!
You're having too many "Or"s! Pick one!
Where is Giles?
What if they were kidnapped by Colombian DRUG LORDS? They could be cutting off Xander's ear right now... Or other parts!
Oz? You missed the turn.
Hello?
What, you can smell her? She doesn't even wear perfume.
Oh my god. This is a residual werewolf thing, isn't it? I think that's very disturbing.
Oh, God.
(dazed) I fell...
Xander...
I can't see you...
(whispers) Xander?
(icy) Stay away from me.
