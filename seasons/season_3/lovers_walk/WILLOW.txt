This is a nightmare. This is... my world is spinning.
Seven-forty verbal? That's.. I'm pathetic. Illiterate! I'm Cletus the slack-jawed yokel.
I just... where did I go wrong?
Buffy! Hey, did you get your SAT scores?
Fourteen-thirty combined?! Buffy, you kicked ass!
Okay, so academic achievement gets me a little excited.
This could, like, change your whole future.
Hey, guys!
A double bowling date! I'm on Oz's team.
They haven't got a prayer. I'm really good -- or I was when we had those inflatable things in the gutters... what's this?
What's the occasion?
It's a little witch Pez!
I like. I MORE than like... This... Oz, this might be the nicest... We need to find a Pez WEREWOLF. Then Pez witch can have a boyfriend!
(starting to well up) This is so thoughtful...
And I don't have anything to give you.
Something's gonna happen.
It's a mistake. It's a terrible, fatal mistake. I see that now.
It's bad bowling. It's a double date with all of us and they're gonna know!
It's a very intimate situation, it's all sexy with the smoke and the sweating and the shoe rental --
(looking down) That's not the issue.
No! Well, okay. No!
Pez!
Any suggestions?
Yeah. It's all on here. Let's see, skink root, essence of rose thorn, a couple canary feathers...
No! I mean... yes. I mean, I know how to do a love spell... but this is for an ANTI-love spell. Kind of a delusting. I guess, the supplies are basically the same, huh?
Oh. Okay.
Thank you.
I will.
Blessed... yeah. You too.
It's just chemistry stuff. An experiment.
It'll help you with the exam. You're WAY behind.
Here. Hold this.
Shush. (to herself) Okay... bring mixture to a boil...
(mild panic) Magic? There's no magic! I mean... bowling. Yeah. Cordelia and Oz are going to meet us here later.
No, no, no. CHEMISTRY book.
No! Of course not! This is a purely scientific... (the gig is up) De-lusting spell. For us. I thought it would go easier if you didn't know.
(guiltily) You SAID you wished these feelings could just go away.
I can't do this anymore Xander! This whole "us" thing is just... BLEAGHH!
It's not just the kissing. It's the groping and the squeezing and the panting, and EVERYTHING that feels really good... until I think about Oz and then it feels really bad. (holds up PEZ) He gave me PEZ, Xander! Even YOU never gave me Pez!
At this moment? I'm thinking no.
Xander!
Um, what... kind of spell...?
Nothing.
I... I can try...
Yes! I'll do it!
No... please... no...
There there...
Whoah! No! Hold it!
Now hold on! I'll do your spell, and, and, I'll get you Drusilla back but there's no bottles in the face and there's no "having"! Of any kind! With me. All right?
I'm not a real witch, you know. I'm not... sure it'll work right away.
This... isn't enough.
There's other ingredients. And I need a book, a spell book. This isn't it.
Not at home... I left it somewhere...
Xander!
Are you okay?
You do.
You were real brave...
Do you need to barf?
The factory. We're locked in the basement.
Pretty much.
He wants me to do a love spell.
Drusilla broke up with him.
He's out of control. I mean, not that he was Joe Restraint in the old days...
Well, I figure either I refuse to do the spell and he kills us, or I do the spell, and he kills us.
He's so drunk he forgets all about us and we starve to death. That's sort of the best one.
We're not supposed to...
Oh, God... Oz...
Don't move! Don't even talk...
No! That's talking! DON'T talk!
It's too unstable, Xander!
Yeah. She lost a lot of blood, but no vital stuff got punctured.
(shaking her head) She couldn't have visitors at first. He's going today.
I didn't know there was anything inside me that could feel this bad.
For the longest time I couldn't figure out what I wanted. I wanted everything. (a tear runs out) Now I just want Oz to talk to me again.
I'm ready. I'm all over groveling.
