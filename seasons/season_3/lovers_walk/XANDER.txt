Will, it's not that bad. Really.
That's right. And the fact that your seven forty verbal closely resembles my combined scores in no way compromises your position as the village idiot.
(softly) You did amazing, Willow. As usual.
Cordelia! Willow is very sad. From her academic failure and how did you do?
This is not good.
I'm just worried it may hurt my standing as campus stud when people find out I'm dating a BRAIN.
Sounds a lot like your regular voice.
Double date... Could have potential...
And from the look on your face, I suspect that we'll be manning the drive-thru side by side.
Buff, that's amazing!
Then why the long face?
Come on, it'll be fun.
What's classier than bowling?
Oz and Willow are down. You're the swing vote. I guarantee fun.
Hey. Those are from the pier.
There's pictures. Of me. On your locker.
For ME, big deal. Never knew I was locker door material.
Yeah, well, prepare to be crushed. (to Cordy) Maybe we should practice...
Like what?
It's bowling.
How are they gonna know?
You're turned on by rented shoes?
Okay, well, let me ask you this: what are they gonna know? That we're friends, old old friends and maybe we had one or two indiscretions but that's all past, we're just very good friends that like to hang out and can I kiss your earlobe?
Bowling may be a bit too much to handle. Man. (lets go) I wish I wasn't so attracted to you. I wish we could just make it stop.
Whoah. It smells like church in here. No, wait... EVIL church.
So you said when you called. Why do I have to be here?
But that's what you love about me, right? Academically dangerous.
Feather. And who will I be tickling?
I assume all this won't make us late for our evening of bowling magic?
Can't we turn on the lights? (then) Is that a spell book?
Wait a minute... we HAVE deja-vu... This is love spell stuff! Are you doing a love spell?
Are you nuts? In case you've forgotten, I tend to have bad luck with these sorts of spells.
I wish lots of things. I told you I wished I was a fireman in sixth grade, but you never followed through on THAT!
Fine! No more kissing. I'm with you.
Exactly. You've got Oz and Pez, I've got Cordy... and well, I've got Cordy. So do we really need to resort to the BLACK ARTS to keep our hormones in check?
Where's the lights?
We gotta clean this up before they get here and start asking questions.
Dizzy. Kinda nauseous, too. Do I remember having a fight with Spike?
I won, right? I kicked his ass.
No... I'm okay. (looks around) Where are we?
The factory where Spike lived? Burnt out place in the middle of nothing... So we're pretty much into a "scream all you want" scenario.
Why didn't he just kill us?
What?
Gee, and we'd all hoped those crazy kids were gonna make it work.
So what are our options?
Give me a third option.
Willow. We're not gonna die. If he's so drunk he'll get sloppy and I'll make my move. As long as my move doesn't involve standing up or using my limbs, we'll be okay.
Exemption for Impending Death Situations.
Oh, God.
Cordy, I...
Cordy...
Cordelia!
Cordy? Don't move! Oz went for help! Oh, God....
I'm going down there.
Will, she needs someone with her.
Just hold on. Please. Hold on...
Cordy...
Cordy...
Can I come in?
They wouldn't let me see you till now.
Look, Cordy, I just need you to know that --
Yeah?
