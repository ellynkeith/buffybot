College.
Where do you want to go?
(realizes) She doesn't know about me.
She wants you to get out.
What are they?
As a friend... I think you should leave. This is a good opportunity.
It's early.
Spike.
Joyce, listen to me!
Joyce, you can't trust him. Invite me in!
You touch her and I'll cut your head off.
Where are they?
Buffy we still need him to find the others.
What?
Right.
Lot of trouble for someone who doesn't even care about you.
She's just kind of fickle...
That's right.
I don't think we have a choice.
Can we get to the roof?
I'm all right.
That window's about to go.
Buffy.
I wondered when you were coming.
I don't accept that.
There must be some way we can still see each other.
