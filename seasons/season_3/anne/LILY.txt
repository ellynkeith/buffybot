Can we get cake?
(good idea) That's better. That's got fruit.
We shouldn't have blown all our money.
Hey . . . do I know you?
Really? Where're you from?
Anne? Anne?
Buffy?
Don't be mad. I won't turn you in or nothing. I guess you don't recognize me.
I mean from before. I was calling myself Chantarelle then. I used to . . . I was in that cult that worshipped vampires. (rolls her eyes) So lame, I know . . .
You kind of saved us. I never thanked you or anything.
Oh, no! Not even Ricky. I was so surprised to see you here,  Waiting tables . . . but I wouldn't tell. I know how it is when  you gotta get lost.
There's a couple of places, they're abandoned and a lot of people  stay there. Ricky knows all those places, he can always find somewhere to crash. He's pretty smart. So how come you came up with Anne?
Lily's from a song. Ricky picked it. I'm always changing anyway. Chantarelle was part of my exotic phase.
It is? That's really embarrassing.
Well, before that I was following this loser Preacher and calling myself Sister Sunshine. There's nothing worse  than that.
It's cool for now. Hey, do you have any money?
I don't mean that like . . .  Well, I just mean, I know a guy,  he's having like a rave kind of thing, in this basement, it's  three dollars to get in and you have to know someone. We could go, I could show you if you had . . . 'cause I'm broke.
(hurt) Well, I didn't mean to bug you . . .
No, that's okay, forget about it.
That's not very polite.
Are you okay?
Maybe you shouldn't move . . .
Buf -- uh, Anne? Can I talk to you?
Rickie's gone. I mean, I haven't seen him for more than a day, he's never left for that long, I think something's happened. Maybe something's happened.
(shaking her head) Rickie's skipped on his parole, they'd just . . .
Can you help me?
But, but, that's who you are and stuff, right? I mean, you help people . . . and, you know . . .
You know how to do stuff . . .
(near tears) But . . . I don't know what to do . . .
We gave blood a lot of times 'cause you get a few bucks  and they have cookies.
It's nice.
Rickie T? We come in sometimes . . .
Can I come with you?
Sorry.
Okay.
Did you find Rickie?
I thought of, he likes to go to this movie house, you can get in the back --
But . . . he takes care of me . . .
We're gonna get a place, his cousin could get him a job at the car wash . . .
Well, that's not Rickie --
Do you mean, like a vampire?
I don't understand . . . maybe it's not Rickie, okay?
But he didn't do anything wrong, why would --
Is it 'cause of you?
You know about . . . monsters and stuff, you could have brought this with you . . .
You can't.
But . . . Rickie . . .
You've seen Rickie?
She said he was dead . . .
Okay.
I guess . . .
A cleansing is like a baptism, right?
And will I see Rickie after?
It looks kind of dirty . . .
What's going on?
I always knew I would come here . . . sooner or later . . . I knew I belonged here . . .
(looking at Buffy) Hell.
Rickie . . .
Years? But . . .
No one.
You're leaving me? But . . .
I'm sorry I said this was your fault before.
Well -- in case we die --
They'll be coming.
(weakly) Gandhi?
What do we do about --
It's really nice.
I never had a place, you know, that I wasn't sharing.
I'm not great at taking care of myself.
Hey . . .
Can I be Anne?
I don't think I'll fit in this.
