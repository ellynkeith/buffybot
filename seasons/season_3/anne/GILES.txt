So, no joy in the cemetery?
Well, for god's sake be careful. I appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire population down until Buffy returns but if any of you should be hurt or killed, I shall take it somewhat amiss.
Entirely.
Good. (re: the last book) You're going to love this.
Yes, thank you.
I have a lead. A friend in Oakland has a sketchy report of a girl fending off a group of vampires a week ago. There's a flight out in an hour.
Well, I believe there is a meal on this flight.
Well, one must try. In the meantime, you might want to take a slight vacation from your slaying.
I just don't want you getting into trouble while I'm away. I should go.
Hello. May I --
I've just come from Oakland. A friend of mine called with a lead. Stories about someone fighting vampires.
It didn't pan out, I'm afraid.
No vampires. Bunch of school kids in heavy mascara listening to extremely silly music.
Buffy is the most capable child I have ever known. She may  Be confused, unhappy, but I honestly believe she's in no danger.
Joyce, you mustn't blame yourself for Buffy's leaving.
I . . . I didn't make Buffy who she is.
