I got him! Go!
Any time now . . .
First of all, what was with the acrobatics? How did that happen?
That's right, he was! (calls out after Andrew) Cheater!
Okay, and the second problem I'm having . . . (turns to Willow) "Come and get it big boy"?
I was always amazed by the way Buffy fought, but . . .  in a way I think we all took her punning for granted.
Sorry. I just meant we in the past took it for granted and won't when she . . . when she comes back.
I can't wait to see Cordelia. I can't believe I can't wait to see Cordelia.
Yeah . . .
She can't just show up. She was kicked out.
Have you guys seen Cordelia?
I don't want to come on too geeky. But, okay, I'm psyched. There's gonna be some heat, if you know what I mean. You guys might want to duck and cover. I'm starting to be geeky. Okay, bye.
How --
Cool.
Hey.
Good summer?
Cool.
I'll see you.
And what makes this different from the last nine leads?
I don't mean to poop the party, it's just, you get hopes all up  and then it's a big fat raspberry and I feel bad.
Oh, yeah. Definitely.
I think he'll find her when she wants to be found.
Boy, I'm glad we showed up for "Depressing Night".
Oh, I know what she's doing. Gabbing to all her friends about her passionate affair with Pedro the cabana boy and laughing about me thinking she might still care about me. (off Willow's look) It's possible you were talking about Buffy.
The slaying isn't getting any easier, either.
We're losing half the vamps.
Let's hope.
Worth checking out.
Good. And this time we'll be ready for him. Take him out  before he does a Kerri Strug on your face.
No, I know what we need.
Next best thing. Bait.
He's already seen Willow. And could you complain louder,  so that all the vampires leave?
Yeah, like I needed <b>that</b> cleared up. Go away. This is my hiding spot.
You don't hide! You're bait! Go act baity.
The vampire attacks you.
The vampire kills you. We watch. We rejoice.
Let me just ask you one thing. How long did it take you to  forget me? Were you still taxiing on the runway, or was it actually in the cab?
