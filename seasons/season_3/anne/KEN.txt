Whoah! Where are you running to?
Maybe I should ask, where are you running <b>from</b>.
You're pretty new around here. You've got the look, though.
Like you had to grow up way too fast. What's your name?
I'm Ken. Go ahead and keep one of these.
Don't be shy about stopping by. I guess you're not starving, but we're not just interested in feeding the body. You might find something you're missing.
Then why are you here?
This isn't a good place for a kid to be. You get old fast here. The thing that does it, that drains the life out of them: despair. Kids come here, they got nothing to go home to and this is the last stop for a lot of them. Shouldn't have to be that way.
Are you okay?
Hey, it's okay. Maybe I can help.
I know you all think I'm a big square, handing out leaflets about hope. But hope is a real thing, just like despair.  Hope can fill up the part of you that's missing.
Rickie? Say, are you Lily? Right, he was talking about you.
Well, sure. Rickie's with us now.
Well, someone sure handed you a tall tale. Rickie's no more dead than I am. Why don't you come to Family Home. And we'll get you taken care of.
Well, don't you look nice.
Well you don't want to wear your own outfit for the cleansing.  It'll get soaked.
Not quite the same.
Of course. He's waiting for you. He's very excited.
We come to this station to wash away the past. Go ahead and kneel. We let the water run over the sin, and the pain, and the uncertainty.
This is a private moment, if you could just --
Do you really want to know?
My face . . . Ow, my face . . .
Do you have any idea how hard it is to <b>glue that thing on</b>?
Guards!
Welcome to my world. I hope you like it.
You're never leaving.
Isn't it?
What is Hell, but the total absence of Hope? The substance, the tactile proof of despair? You're right, Lily. This is where you've been heading all your life. You come from nothing, to become nothing.
Just like Rickie.
He forgot you. It took a long time - he remembered your name years after he'd forgotten his own. But in the end . . .
Time here moves more quickly than in your dimension. A hundred long years will pass here -- on Earth, just a day.
Very good. (to Lily) You see, Lily, you'll die of old age before anyone wonders where you went. Not that anyone will. That's why we chose you.
No, but I know you, "Anne". So afraid, so pathetically determined to run away from whatever you used to be. To disappear. Congratulations. You got your wish.
Humans don't fight back. <b>Humans don't fight back!  <u>THAT'S HOW THIS WORKS!!</u></b>
(to the guard) Get down there!
One of you fights . . . and you all die!
That . . . was not permitted.
You've got guts. I think I'd like to split you open and play with them. (to the assembled) Let everyone know, this is the price of rebell --
--llioOOAA<b>AHHHHGHSCHRRGH</b>!!
You . . . ruined . . . you . . .
