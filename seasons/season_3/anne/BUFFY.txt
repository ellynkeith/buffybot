How did you find me here?
Stay with me.
Pay at the counter.
Are you guys ready?
What'll you have?
Well . . .
We got peach pie. I can't guarantee there's a peach in it . . .
It's nice. It's nice and . . . permanent.
(abrupt) I don't think so.
I'll get your pie.
Can you cover my station for a while? I'm not feeling great.
Lily?
Oh, yeah . . .
Did you tell anyone who I was?
So, you live nearby?
It's my middle name.
It's nice. It's a mushroom.
It's an exotic mushroom, if that's any comfort.
Nothing springs to mind, it's true . . .  What about at home, what'd they call you?
Well, I like Lily.
I don't think so. I kind of want to be alone.
No, I just mean a lot of people would be too much. (digs into pocket) Here, why don't you go with Rickie, and I'll see you some time --
No, really, I --
Whoah!
Are you okay?
What?
It's okay . . .
I have to go . . .
I'm sorry . . .
The look.
Anne.
I'm all right.
We got kind of a rush here, is there another time --
Well, did you talk to the police?
Well, you could . . . I don't know, ask around and --
I can't.
I can't get into this now, I'm sorry . . .
I can't; not anymore . . .
I'm off at four.
You're a fan of the sugar rush, aren't you.
Oh, no. I mean, I can't. Needles. They make me woozy. Which is weird, 'cause I don't have a problem with battle axes, but needles . . . (recovers herself) We're looking for a friend.
Has he been in, do you know? In the last day or so?
This'll probably go faster if we split up.
Okay, when did I lose you on the whole splitting up thing?
We can both check out some of your hangouts and meet later.  At my place.
Thanks.
This is for the downstairs . . .
Oh, god . . .
Rickie . . .
Lily, I think . . . that he's dead.
I'm sorry . . .
Lily. Something's happening. The person I found was old,  he looked about eighty --
I'm sure it was. Lily, something drained the life out of him. Made him old. I don't know how, but . . . there could be something out there.
(thinking it through) They wouldn't accelerate the aging process, but maybe . . . maybe something in his blood . . . When was the last time you guys gave  blood together?
Lily. You have to deal with this.
That's not the point. These things happen, you can't close your eyes and hope they'll go away.
What?
(snapping) I didn't bring anything with me! And I didn't ask for you to come to me with your problems. I just wanted to be left alone. If you can't deal with what's happening, don't lay it off on me --
Lily --
Candidate for what?
(looking at the file) Breaking into your office and looking through your private files. Candidate for what?
You've got a whole bunch of candidates here. I wonder if any of these kids are missing like Rickie. Gosh I'll bet they are.
I don't want any trouble. I just want to be alone and quiet, you know, with a chair, and a fireplace, and a tea cozy.  I'm not even sure what a tea cozy is, but I want one. Instead, I get trouble. Which I am willing to share. What are you doing to these kids?
(steely eyed) Give them to who? (beat) Or, wait -- give them to <b>whom</b>? Or maybe it's who . . .
You know, I just looked in the mirror and thought, hey! What's with all the sin? I need to change. I'm dirty, I'm bad . . . with the sex, and the . . . envy, and that loud music we kids listen to nowadays . . .
I just suck at undercover. Where's Ken?
How do you make 'em old, Ken? You feed on youth, what's the deal?
Lily?
Lily?
Lily! Come on!
We got to find another exit, there's gotta be . . .
Lily . . . ?
Where?
This . . . isn't Hell . . .
Don't listen to him . . .
So you work us till we're too old, then spit us back out.
You didn't choose me.
I'm Buffy. The vampire slayer. And you are . . . ?
Anyone who's not having fun here, follow me.
There's no way we can get there without meeting new people.  Okay, Lily, when those guards leave, and they will, you take  these guys and get up there. Fast and quiet. Anybody else  wants to come along, fine, but you don't stop for anything. Clear?
Lily. You can handle this. 'Cause I say so.
Ooh, we've gone public. Get them out. Go!
This can wait!
GO!
Not yet, not yet . . .
Here's good.
Demons: not that bright.
Yeah, but it was fun . . .
Hold on . . .
Okay . . . this works the quads, and also the glutials . . .
Man, I'm gonna feel this for --
Hey Ken. Wanna see my impression of Gandhi?
Well, you know . . . if he was really pissed off.
It's closed. It's gone.
Let me give you the tour.
This concludes our tour.
The bathroom works a good part of the time. Don't bother to flip the mattress 'cause it doesn't get any better.
Well, it's paid up through the next three weeks.
I talked to Mitch at the diner and he said you could start on Thursday. He's kind of, well, repulsive . . . but he won't give you a hard time. I'll be checking up on you, see how you're doing.
It gets easier. Takes practice.
You could wear it as a hat . . .
