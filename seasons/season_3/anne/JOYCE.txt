Mr. Giles. Hello.
Of course. Come on in.
No Buffy.
Well, thank you for going. I can't even . . . I can hardly  leave the house. I'm so afraid that she'll call, that she'll . . .  need help . . .
I just wish I could talk to her. The last thing we did was fight . . .
I don't . . . (looking him in the eye) I blame you.
You've been this huge influence in her life, guiding her - you've had this whole relationship behind my back that I . . . I feel like you've taken her away from me.
And who exactly is she?
