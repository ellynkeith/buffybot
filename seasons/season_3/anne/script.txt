WILLOW: That's right, big boy . . .
WILLOW: Come and get it.
XANDER: I got him! Go!
XANDER: Any time now . . .
WILLOW: He's getting away. And, ow!
OZ: That really never works. (turns to the others) Are you guys all right?
WILLOW: I can't believe he got away.
XANDER: First of all, what was with the acrobatics? How did that happen?
OZ: Wasn't Andy Hoelich on the gymnastics team?
XANDER: That's right, he was! (calls out after Andrew) Cheater!
WILLOW: That wasn't in the obituary. I should have checked the school records.
XANDER: Okay, and the second problem I'm having . . . (turns to Willow) "Come and get it big boy"?
WILLOW: (defensively) Well, well, the <b>slayer</b> always says a pun or a witty play on words and I think it throws vampires off and makes them frightened that I'm wisecracking and okay, I didn't really have time to work on that one but <b>you</b> try it every time!
OZ: If I can suggest . . . "This time it's personal . . ."? I mean, there's a reason why it's a classic.
XANDER: I was always amazed by the way Buffy fought, but . . .  in a way I think we all took her punning for granted.
WILLOW: Xander. Past Tense Rule.
XANDER: Sorry. I just meant we in the past took it for granted and won't when she . . . when she comes back.
WILLOW: Do you think she knows school's starting tomorrow?
OZ: Tomorrow. Right. The big day.
WILLOW: (to comfort him) I'm gonna be busy a lot, but only till three and that's when you usually get up, so it's not bad.
OZ: (hiding something) Yeah . . .
XANDER: I can't wait to see Cordelia. I can't believe I can't wait to see Cordelia.
WILLOW: (excited) I wonder what our first homework assignment will be! (off Xander's look) Hey, you're excited about Cordelia, okay? We've all got issues.
OZ: I guess we should pack it in.
XANDER: Yeah . . .
WILLOW: Wouldn't it be great if Buffy just showed up tomorrow? Like nothing happened?
XANDER: She can't just show up. She was kicked out.
WILLOW: Well, yeah, but . . . I just wish . . . (softly) I wish we knew where she was.
BUFFY: How did you find me here?
ANGEL: (intimately) If I was blind, I would see you.
BUFFY: Stay with me.
ANGEL: Forever. That's the whole point. I'll never leave. (whispers) Not even if you kill me.
WAITRESS: Anything else?
ROUGHNECK: That'll do us, peaches.
BUFFY: Pay at the counter.
ROUGHNECK: (leering) Sure you don't want me to work it off?
BUFFY: Are you guys ready?
RICKIE: Yeah, I think we're good, um . . .
RICKIE: . . . Anne.
BUFFY: What'll you have?
RICKIE: Well, okay . . .
RICKIE: (counting the change) What can we get with this?
BUFFY: Well . . .
LILY: Can we get cake?
RICKIE: Don't be stupid! We gotta eat healthy. Can't have cake. (to Buffy) Can we get pie?
LILY: (good idea) That's better. That's got fruit.
BUFFY: We got peach pie. I can't guarantee there's a peach in it . . .
LILY: We shouldn't have blown all our money.
RICKIE: It was worth it. (to Buffy) Check this out.
BUFFY: It's nice. It's nice and . . . permanent.
RICKIE: Yeah, well, forever. That's the whole point.
LILY: Hey . . . do I know you?
BUFFY: (abrupt) I don't think so.
LILY: Really? Where're you from?
BUFFY: I'll get your pie.
BUFFY: Can you cover my station for a while? I'm not feeling great.
GILES: So, no joy in the cemetery?
WILLOW: No, he got away. We still have glitches in the system, like vampires getting away. But I think we're improving.
GILES: Well, for god's sake be careful. I appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire population down until Buffy returns but if any of you should be hurt or killed, I shall take it somewhat amiss.
WILLOW: You'd be cranky.
GILES: Entirely.
WILLOW: Well, we try not to get killed. That's part of our whole mission statement. Don't get killed.
GILES: Good. (re: the last book) You're going to love this.
WILLOW: Hi!
CORDELIA: Hey, Willow.
WILLOW: How was your summer?
CORDELIA: (putting her bag on the counter while she takes off her jacket) I can't believe you brought that up. Las Palmas was the <u>nightmare</u> resort. They order you around, they make you have organized (making quotemarks) "fun", and I make sarcastic quotemarks, plus the fact that there are cockroaches in Mexico big enough to own property. It was all about dread.
CORDELIA: So, how was your summer?
CORDELIA: Is Xander here?
WILLOW: Well, uh, yeah. Somewhere.
CORDELIA: (obviously excited) Good. Great. I haven't seen him yet. Do I look okay? How's my hair?
WILLOW: It's good.
CORDELIA: He didn't meet anybody over the summer, did he? No, this is Sunnydale, who could he meet except for monsters and stuff,  then again he's always kind of attracted to monsters . . .  How's my hair?
WILLOW: Still good. (looks off) Hi!
CORDELIA: (fear) Maybe he's forgotten me. (lust) Well, I'll make him remember. See ya.
WILLOW: You came to visit me! (puzzled) You came with books. (brightening) Are they books for me?
OZ: Actually, they're kind of for me.
WILLOW: I don't get it.
OZ: Well, it's sort of a funny story. (as they start up the hall) Remember when I didn't graduate?
WILLOW: Well, I know you had a lot of incompletes, but that's why you had summer school.
OZ: Yeah. Remember when I didn't go?
TEACHER: Slow down, people! Summer's over. Be somber.
WILLOW: But you never said anything. How am I supposed to react to this rather alarming news?
OZ: I was pretty much banking on you finding it cute.
WILLOW: Well, traditionally, repeating a grade is not a turn on. And you're practically a genius! You're Mister Test Scores! It's all a little weird.
OZ: So the cute thing is out?
XANDER: Have you guys seen Cordelia?
WILLOW: She's here somewhere --
XANDER: I don't want to come on too geeky. But, okay, I'm psyched. There's gonna be some heat, if you know what I mean. You guys might want to duck and cover. I'm starting to be geeky. Okay, bye.
XANDER: How --
WILLOW: Your hair's fine.
XANDER: Cool.
LARRY: This is our year, I'm telling you. Best football season ever.  I'm so in shape, I'm a rock - it's all about egg whites -  we got Garrity at running back, Dale at QB, if we can focus, keep discipline and not have quite as many mysterious  deaths, Sunnydale is gonna RULE.
WILLOW: I'm trying to get to cute, really, but I'm still sorta stuck on "strange".
OZ: Okay, well, I'd be willing to bargain down to "eccentric" with an option on "cool".
WILLOW: Let me sleep on it, you know, and we'll get back to you.
XANDER: Hey.
CORDELIA: Hey.
XANDER: Good summer?
CORDELIA: It was all right.
XANDER: Cool.
CORDELIA: Yeah.
XANDER: I'll see you.
CORDELIA: Yeah, whatever.
WOMAN: I'm no one . . . I'm no one . . .
GILES: Yes, thank you.
GILES: I have a lead. A friend in Oakland has a sketchy report of a girl fending off a group of vampires a week ago. There's a flight out in an hour.
XANDER: And what makes this different from the last nine leads?
GILES: Well, I believe there is a meal on this flight.
XANDER: I don't mean to poop the party, it's just, you get hopes all up  and then it's a big fat raspberry and I feel bad.
WILLOW: It's still good that you're looking, though. You shouldn't give up.
XANDER: Oh, yeah. Definitely.
GILES: Well, one must try. In the meantime, you might want to take a slight vacation from your slaying.
WILLOW: Hey, we're doing okay. (bitterly) Except that last guy totally threw off our stats . . .
GILES: I just don't want you getting into trouble while I'm away. I should go.
WILLOW: You don't think maybe he'll find her?
XANDER: I think he'll find her when she wants to be found.
LILY: Anne? Anne?
LILY: Buffy?
LILY: Don't be mad. I won't turn you in or nothing. I guess you don't recognize me.
BUFFY: Lily?
LILY: I mean from before. I was calling myself Chantarelle then. I used to . . . I was in that cult that worshipped vampires. (rolls her eyes) So lame, I know . . .
BUFFY: Oh, yeah . . .
LILY: You kind of saved us. I never thanked you or anything.
BUFFY: Did you tell anyone who I was?
LILY: Oh, no! Not even Ricky. I was so surprised to see you here,  Waiting tables . . . but I wouldn't tell. I know how it is when  you gotta get lost.
BUFFY: So, you live nearby?
LILY: There's a couple of places, they're abandoned and a lot of people  stay there. Ricky knows all those places, he can always find somewhere to crash. He's pretty smart. So how come you came up with Anne?
BUFFY: It's my middle name.
LILY: Lily's from a song. Ricky picked it. I'm always changing anyway. Chantarelle was part of my exotic phase.
BUFFY: It's nice. It's a mushroom.
LILY: It is? That's really embarrassing.
BUFFY: It's an exotic mushroom, if that's any comfort.
LILY: Well, before that I was following this loser Preacher and calling myself Sister Sunshine. There's nothing worse  than that.
BUFFY: Nothing springs to mind, it's true . . .  What about at home, what'd they call you?
BUFFY: Well, I like Lily.
LILY: It's cool for now. Hey, do you have any money?
LILY: I don't mean that like . . .  Well, I just mean, I know a guy,  he's having like a rave kind of thing, in this basement, it's  three dollars to get in and you have to know someone. We could go, I could show you if you had . . . 'cause I'm broke.
BUFFY: I don't think so. I kind of want to be alone.
LILY: (hurt) Well, I didn't mean to bug you . . .
BUFFY: No, I just mean a lot of people would be too much. (digs into pocket) Here, why don't you go with Rickie, and I'll see you some time --
LILY: No, that's okay, forget about it.
BUFFY: No, really, I --
BUFFY: Whoah!
LILY: That's not very polite.
BUFFY: Are you okay?
MAN: I'm no one . . .
BUFFY: What?
LILY: Are you okay?
GUY: Jeez, I didn't see you!
LILY: Maybe you shouldn't move . . .
GUY: Yeah, you should lie down. Somebody call an ambulance!
BUFFY: It's okay . . .
BUFFY: I have to go . . .
KEN: Whoah! Where are you running to?
BUFFY: I'm sorry . . .
KEN: Maybe I should ask, where are you running <b>from</b>.
KEN: You're pretty new around here. You've got the look, though.
BUFFY: The look.
KEN: Like you had to grow up way too fast. What's your name?
BUFFY: Anne.
KEN: I'm Ken. Go ahead and keep one of these.
KEN: Don't be shy about stopping by. I guess you're not starving, but we're not just interested in feeding the body. You might find something you're missing.
BUFFY: I'm all right.
KEN: Then why are you here?
KEN: This isn't a good place for a kid to be. You get old fast here. The thing that does it, that drains the life out of them: despair. Kids come here, they got nothing to go home to and this is the last stop for a lot of them. Shouldn't have to be that way.
XANDER: Boy, I'm glad we showed up for "Depressing Night".
WILLOW: I wonder what she's doing right now.
XANDER: Oh, I know what she's doing. Gabbing to all her friends about her passionate affair with Pedro the cabana boy and laughing about me thinking she might still care about me. (off Willow's look) It's possible you were talking about Buffy.
WILLOW: It's possible. (looking around) The Bronze just never seems the same without her.
XANDER: The slaying isn't getting any easier, either.
OZ: I think we're getting a rhythm down.
XANDER: We're losing half the vamps.
OZ: Yeah, but rhythmically.
WILLOW: Oh! That reminds me. (pulls out a folded up piece of paper) I asked around about Andrew Hoelich, our gymnastic vampire, and apparently, (looking at her notes) he used to like to hang out in Hammersmith Park and pick up grills! (looks closer) Or, okay, that could be "girls".
XANDER: Let's hope.
OZ: Are we thinking old habits die hard?
XANDER: Worth checking out.
WILLOW: Tomorrow night?
XANDER: Good. And this time we'll be ready for him. Take him out  before he does a Kerri Strug on your face.
WILLOW: We just need to work on our timing, I think.
XANDER: No, I know what we need.
OZ: A vampire slayer?
XANDER: Next best thing. Bait.
LILY: Buf -- uh, Anne? Can I talk to you?
BUFFY: We got kind of a rush here, is there another time --
LILY: Rickie's gone. I mean, I haven't seen him for more than a day, he's never left for that long, I think something's happened. Maybe something's happened.
BUFFY: Well, did you talk to the police?
LILY: (shaking her head) Rickie's skipped on his parole, they'd just . . .
BUFFY: Well, you could . . . I don't know, ask around and --
LILY: Can you help me?
BUFFY: I can't.
LILY: But, but, that's who you are and stuff, right? I mean, you help people . . . and, you know . . .
BUFFY: I can't get into this now, I'm sorry . . .
LILY: You know how to do stuff . . .
BUFFY: I can't; not anymore . . .
LILY: (near tears) But . . . I don't know what to do . . .
BUFFY: I'm off at four.
JOYCE: Mr. Giles. Hello.
GILES: Hello. May I --
JOYCE: Of course. Come on in.
GILES: I've just come from Oakland. A friend of mine called with a lead. Stories about someone fighting vampires.
GILES: It didn't pan out, I'm afraid.
JOYCE: No Buffy.
GILES: No vampires. Bunch of school kids in heavy mascara listening to extremely silly music.
JOYCE: Well, thank you for going. I can't even . . . I can hardly  leave the house. I'm so afraid that she'll call, that she'll . . .  need help . . .
GILES: Buffy is the most capable child I have ever known. She may  Be confused, unhappy, but I honestly believe she's in no danger.
JOYCE: I just wish I could talk to her. The last thing we did was fight . . .
GILES: Joyce, you mustn't blame yourself for Buffy's leaving.
JOYCE: I don't . . . (looking him in the eye) I blame you.
JOYCE: You've been this huge influence in her life, guiding her - you've had this whole relationship behind my back that I . . . I feel like you've taken her away from me.
GILES: I . . . I didn't make Buffy who she is.
JOYCE: And who exactly is she?
LILY: We gave blood a lot of times 'cause you get a few bucks  and they have cookies.
BUFFY: You're a fan of the sugar rush, aren't you.
LILY: It's nice.
JOAN: (crossing to them) Hi. Are you here to donate blood?
BUFFY: Oh, no. I mean, I can't. Needles. They make me woozy. Which is weird, 'cause I don't have a problem with battle axes, but needles . . . (recovers herself) We're looking for a friend.
LILY: Rickie T? We come in sometimes . . .
JOAN: Rickie, sure. He's not here . . .
BUFFY: Has he been in, do you know? In the last day or so?
JOAN: Let me check the sheet.
BUFFY: This'll probably go faster if we split up.
LILY: Can I come with you?
BUFFY: Okay, when did I lose you on the whole splitting up thing?
LILY: Sorry.
BUFFY: We can both check out some of your hangouts and meet later.  At my place.
LILY: Okay.
JOAN: (returning) Sorry, guys. He hasn't been here.
BUFFY: Thanks.
JOAN: I'll tell him you were looking . . .
BUFFY: This is for the downstairs . . .
BUFFY: Oh, god . . .
BUFFY: Rickie . . .
LILY: Did you find Rickie?
LILY: I thought of, he likes to go to this movie house, you can get in the back --
BUFFY: Lily, I think . . . that he's dead.
LILY: But . . . he takes care of me . . .
BUFFY: I'm sorry . . .
LILY: We're gonna get a place, his cousin could get him a job at the car wash . . .
BUFFY: Lily. Something's happening. The person I found was old,  he looked about eighty --
LILY: Well, that's not Rickie --
BUFFY: I'm sure it was. Lily, something drained the life out of him. Made him old. I don't know how, but . . . there could be something out there.
LILY: Do you mean, like a vampire?
BUFFY: (thinking it through) They wouldn't accelerate the aging process, but maybe . . . maybe something in his blood . . . When was the last time you guys gave  blood together?
LILY: I don't understand . . . maybe it's not Rickie, okay?
BUFFY: Lily. You have to deal with this.
LILY: But he didn't do anything wrong, why would --
BUFFY: That's not the point. These things happen, you can't close your eyes and hope they'll go away.
LILY: Is it 'cause of you?
BUFFY: What?
LILY: You know about . . . monsters and stuff, you could have brought this with you . . .
BUFFY: (snapping) I didn't bring anything with me! And I didn't ask for you to come to me with your problems. I just wanted to be left alone. If you can't deal with what's happening, don't lay it off on me --
BUFFY: Lily --
KEN: Are you okay?
KEN: Hey, it's okay. Maybe I can help.
LILY: You can't.
KEN: I know you all think I'm a big square, handing out leaflets about hope. But hope is a real thing, just like despair.  Hope can fill up the part of you that's missing.
LILY: But . . . Rickie . . .
KEN: Rickie? Say, are you Lily? Right, he was talking about you.
LILY: You've seen Rickie?
KEN: Well, sure. Rickie's with us now.
LILY: She said he was dead . . .
KEN: Well, someone sure handed you a tall tale. Rickie's no more dead than I am. Why don't you come to Family Home. And we'll get you taken care of.
LILY: Okay.
BUFFY: Candidate for what?
JOAN: What are you doing?
BUFFY: (looking at the file) Breaking into your office and looking through your private files. Candidate for what?
JOAN: I'm calling the police.
BUFFY: You've got a whole bunch of candidates here. I wonder if any of these kids are missing like Rickie. Gosh I'll bet they are.
JOAN: You're gonna get yourself in a lot of trouble.
BUFFY: I don't want any trouble. I just want to be alone and quiet, you know, with a chair, and a fireplace, and a tea cozy.  I'm not even sure what a tea cozy is, but I want one. Instead, I get trouble. Which I am willing to share. What are you doing to these kids?
JOAN: Nothing! I just . . . give him names. He likes to know who . . . I give him the names of the healthy ones.
BUFFY: (steely eyed) Give them to who? (beat) Or, wait -- give them to <b>whom</b>? Or maybe it's who . . .
KEN: Well, don't you look nice.
LILY: I guess . . .
KEN: Well you don't want to wear your own outfit for the cleansing.  It'll get soaked.
LILY: A cleansing is like a baptism, right?
KEN: Not quite the same.
LILY: And will I see Rickie after?
KEN: Of course. He's waiting for you. He's very excited.
CORDELIA: Why do I have to be bait? I'm always bait! Let Willow be bait.
XANDER: He's already seen Willow. And could you complain louder,  so that all the vampires leave?
OZ: I think this is a good spot. Is everybody packing?
OZ: Let's do it.
CORDELIA: I only offered to help for Buffy's sake. It had nothing to do with you.
XANDER: Yeah, like I needed <b>that</b> cleared up. Go away. This is my hiding spot.
CORDELIA: Well, where do I hide?
XANDER: You don't hide! You're bait! Go act baity.
CORDELIA: What's the plan?
XANDER: The vampire attacks you.
CORDELIA: And then what?
XANDER: The vampire kills you. We watch. We rejoice.
KEN: We come to this station to wash away the past. Go ahead and kneel. We let the water run over the sin, and the pain, and the uncertainty.
LILY: It looks kind of dirty . . .
BUFFY: You know, I just looked in the mirror and thought, hey! What's with all the sin? I need to change. I'm dirty, I'm bad . . . with the sex, and the . . . envy, and that loud music we kids listen to nowadays . . .
BUFFY: I just suck at undercover. Where's Ken?
KEN: This is a private moment, if you could just --
BUFFY: How do you make 'em old, Ken? You feed on youth, what's the deal?
KEN: Do you really want to know?
LILY: What's going on?
BUFFY: Lily?
BUFFY: Lily?
KEN: My face . . . Ow, my face . . .
KEN: Do you have any idea how hard it is to <b>glue that thing on</b>?
KEN: Guards!
BUFFY: Lily! Come on!
BUFFY: We got to find another exit, there's gotta be . . .
KEN: Welcome to my world. I hope you like it.
KEN: You're never leaving.
XANDER: Let me just ask you one thing. How long did it take you to  forget me? Were you still taxiing on the runway, or was it actually in the cab?
CORDELIA: Oh, yeah, like you were Mr. Faithful. Probably met some hot little inca mummy girl -- yeah, I heard about her --
CORDELIA: Xander!
BUFFY: Lily . . . ?
LILY: I always knew I would come here . . . sooner or later . . . I knew I belonged here . . .
BUFFY: Where?
LILY: (looking at Buffy) Hell.
BUFFY: This . . . isn't Hell . . .
KEN: Isn't it?
KEN: What is Hell, but the total absence of Hope? The substance, the tactile proof of despair? You're right, Lily. This is where you've been heading all your life. You come from nothing, to become nothing.
BUFFY: Don't listen to him . . .
KEN: Just like Rickie.
LILY: Rickie . . .
KEN: He forgot you. It took a long time - he remembered your name years after he'd forgotten his own. But in the end . . .
LILY: Years? But . . .
KEN: Time here moves more quickly than in your dimension. A hundred long years will pass here -- on Earth, just a day.
BUFFY: So you work us till we're too old, then spit us back out.
KEN: Very good. (to Lily) You see, Lily, you'll die of old age before anyone wonders where you went. Not that anyone will. That's why we chose you.
BUFFY: You didn't choose me.
KEN: No, but I know you, "Anne". So afraid, so pathetically determined to run away from whatever you used to be. To disappear. Congratulations. You got your wish.
GUARD: You work, and you live. That is all. You do not complain, or laugh, or do anything besides work. Whatever you thought, whatever you were, does not matter. You are no one now, you mean nothing.
GUARD: Who are you?
PRISONER: (terrified) Aaron . . .
GUARD: Who are you?
LILY: No one.
GUARD: Who are you?
PRISONER: No one.
GUARD: Who are you?
PRISONER: No one.
GUARD: Who are you?
BUFFY: I'm Buffy. The vampire slayer. And you are . . . ?
BUFFY: Anyone who's not having fun here, follow me.
BUFFY: There's no way we can get there without meeting new people.  Okay, Lily, when those guards leave, and they will, you take  these guys and get up there. Fast and quiet. Anybody else  wants to come along, fine, but you don't stop for anything. Clear?
LILY: You're leaving me? But . . .
BUFFY: Lily. You can handle this. 'Cause I say so.
BUFFY: Ooh, we've gone public. Get them out. Go!
LILY: I'm sorry I said this was your fault before.
BUFFY: This can wait!
LILY: Well -- in case we die --
BUFFY: GO!
BUFFY: Not yet, not yet . . .
BUFFY: Here's good.
KEN: Humans don't fight back. <b>Humans don't fight back!  <u>THAT'S HOW THIS WORKS!!</u></b>
KEN: (to the guard) Get down there!
BUFFY: Demons: not that bright.
KEN: One of you fights . . . and you all die!
KEN: That . . . was not permitted.
BUFFY: Yeah, but it was fun . . .
KEN: You've got guts. I think I'd like to split you open and play with them. (to the assembled) Let everyone know, this is the price of rebell --
KEN: --llioOOAA<b>AHHHHGHSCHRRGH</b>!!
LILY: They'll be coming.
BUFFY: Hold on . . .
BUFFY: Okay . . . this works the quads, and also the glutials . . .
BUFFY: Man, I'm gonna feel this for --
KEN: You . . . ruined . . . you . . .
BUFFY: Hey Ken. Wanna see my impression of Gandhi?
LILY: (weakly) Gandhi?
BUFFY: Well, you know . . . if he was really pissed off.
LILY: What do we do about --
BUFFY: It's closed. It's gone.
BUFFY: Let me give you the tour.
BUFFY: This concludes our tour.
LILY: It's really nice.
BUFFY: The bathroom works a good part of the time. Don't bother to flip the mattress 'cause it doesn't get any better.
LILY: I never had a place, you know, that I wasn't sharing.
BUFFY: Well, it's paid up through the next three weeks.
BUFFY: I talked to Mitch at the diner and he said you could start on Thursday. He's kind of, well, repulsive . . . but he won't give you a hard time. I'll be checking up on you, see how you're doing.
LILY: I'm not great at taking care of myself.
BUFFY: It gets easier. Takes practice.
LILY: Hey . . .
LILY: Can I be Anne?
LILY: I don't think I'll fit in this.
BUFFY: You could wear it as a hat . . .
