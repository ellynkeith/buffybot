It's not noise, it's music.
I'm aerobicizing. I must have the beat.
I'm on a beach. Not an American beach -- one of those island beaches where the water is way too blue. It's just before sunset, I'm lying on a towel and Gavin Rossdale is massaging my feet.
Very impressive. An eye for detail.
Just having a quick game of "Anywhere But Here."
He probably sat in math class thinking,  "There should be more math! This  could be mathier."
Are you kidding? His diapers were tweed.
Morning. Say, is that tweed?
Is it stuffy in here, or is it just you?
So, what's on tap tonight that's so important? Uprising? Prophesied ritual? Preordained death-fest?
Aha. Vampire meals-on-wheels.
And I'll bring the party mix.
Giles, have I ever let you down?
(to Xander) You've got a bit of schlub on your shoe, there.
Look at them.
"Don't be late." Sheesh.
Giles, why is your phone busy when you're supposed to be here?
Operator, can you check a line for me...
Never mind. Sorry.
All's well that ends with cute E.R. doctors I always say.
Since when do doctors take deliveries?
Angel!
How did you know about this?
Can you make sure the hospital gets the rest? (he nods) I'm worried about Giles. He was supposed to meet me here.
Giles? Who counts tardiness as the eighth deadly sin?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Giles, did you forget about the hospital?  Vampires? Bags of blood in handy carry  out packets?
No. I mean, my feelings a little. What's wrong?
(to Jenny) Actually I wanted to talk to you for a second.
I'm not sure...
Well, it's Giles.
I don't know. He didn't show up last night when he was supposed to, and then I went by his place and he was acting... well, very Anti-Giles.
He wouldn't let me in. He looked terrible. And I think he might have been... uh, I think he was drinking.
It wasn't tea, will.
He was alone.
None of you have noticed anything different about him lately?
Haven't seen anything weird?
And you waited until now to tell us because...?
I'm calling him right now.
I know you, you ran that costume shop.
You sold me that dress for Halloween and nearly got us all killed.
I'll let you know when we're even. (then) I'm going to ask you once again and then I'm pretty much going straight to the pummeling: what are you doing here?
Honesty. Nice touch.
I got a great idea...
...why don't I just call the police and have you arrested for breaking and entering and get back to my fun Saturday.
You know Giles?
Giles, it's me.
What's the Mark of Eyghon?
Giles?
I'm in your office with someone who claims to be an old friend of yours: Ethan Rayne.
I'm not going anywhere until you start giving me some answers --
(to Xander, re: Ethan) Don't let him get away!
You know him?
Uh, Cordelia, I did tell him to speak.
What dreams, what's going on?
Giles?
Giles, what's going on?
I don't care from private, I care from  dead guys attacking us, I care from  you Lost Weekending in your apartment.
Solution is good. Why don't we share?  What's the mark of Eyghon?
We have work to do. Willow, I want you to find out anything and everything you can about the mark  of Eyghon.
Thrill, as I ignore it completely. He needs our help and he's going to get it.
So we hit the books.
Xander, how do you feel about rifling through Giles' personal files, see if you can shed some light.
What?
Work with Xander.
Cordelia.
What about not temporary?
I still don't understand what this has to do with Giles.
Wait a minute. The dead guy. He's all puddly now.
No one dead...
Thank you, operator.
No answer at Ms. Calendar's and Giles' line is out of order. I'm getting over there.
Back off. Just stay back.
Are you all right?
Giles, how do we stop this thing?
Talk to me! Giles, you're scaring me.
(hurt anger) Don't be sorry! Be Giles! Come on, we fight monsters. They show up, they scare us, I beat them up, and they leave. This isn't any different.
Because you don't know how to stop it.
Eyghon.
You couldn't control it.
God...
Three down, two to go.
Then it's going after Ethan. I better  beat it there.
You're barely mobile and speed is of the serious essence.
I got the guys working on it. I'll try to contain her till we can figure something.
I know.
Ethan...
I'm not here to hurt you... I'm sorry to say. Giles told me everything. It's coming for you. We've got to stop it.
Don't worry, it's nothing personal: to protect Giles I have to protect you.
Because he's Giles.
Lucky you.
That's all right. I'm not big on running anyway.
One of us is. You're gonna hide till it's over.
Is there a way in through the back?
Well, we can set you up back there. Come on.
What fun?
You know what? I'm not real interested in joining your club.
I'm going to kill you. Will that blow  the whole karma thing?
Listen to me, Ethan. This is a BAD IDEA. You're dealing with something very dangerous.
I'm not talking about Eyghon.
No!
It's in Angel!
You knew that if the demon was in danger it would jump into the nearest dead guy.
Winner and still champion.
Darn. I really wanted to hit him till he bled.
The worst thing is, I was saving up for some very important shoes. Now I gotta blow my allowance getting this stupid tattoo removed. I just hope mom doesn't see it first.
But it did.
Maybe you should consider a career as a Watcher.
I don't think he has a choice.
How is she?
I'm sorry to hear that... I think...
Maybe you should.
I'm not gonna lie. It was scary. I'm used  to you being, you know, The Grown-up.  And then I find out that you're a person.
Who would've thought?
So after all this time it turns out we do have something in common. Which, apart from being a little weird... is kind of okay.
I think we're supposed to be training, right?
(holds up CD) I got the perfect music.
Go on, you know you want to say it.
There. Feel better?
(an "I don't know you" look) Oh, god...
