PHILIP: Rupert Giles. I need to see him...
CUSTODIAN: Mr. Giles, he's our librarian. Next building over, first door on your left.
CUSTODIAN: You're welcome.
PHILIP: Oh God...
PHILIP: ...Deirdre?
PHILIP: God, no! Help!
PHILIP: Help me...!
GILES: (shouts above music) Must we have such noise during your calisthenics?
BUFFY: It's not noise, it's music.
GILES: I know music. Music has notes. This is noise.
BUFFY: I'm aerobicizing. I must have the beat.
GILES: Wonderful. You work on your muscle tone while my brains dribble out my ears.
PHILIP: Somebody, please!
GILES: Ah. Very good. The rest is silence.
GUY: (English accent) Time to go to sleep.
BUFFY: I'm on a beach. Not an American beach -- one of those island beaches where the water is way too blue. It's just before sunset, I'm lying on a towel and Gavin Rossdale is massaging my feet.
WILLOW: That's good. Uh, i'm in Florence, Italy. I've rented a scooter which is parked outside. I'm in a little restaurant having ziti and there's no more tables so they have to seat this guy with me and it's John Cusack.
BUFFY: Very impressive. An eye for detail.
WILLOW: (excited) 'Cause, with the ziti.
XANDER: What are you guys up to?
BUFFY: Just having a quick game of "Anywhere But Here."
XANDER: Amy Yip at the waterslide park.
WILLOW: You never come up with anything new.
XANDER: I'm not fickle like you two, okay? I'm constant in my affections. Amy Yip at the waterslide park.
WILLOW: You think Giles ever played "Anywhere But Here" in school?
XANDER: Giles lived for school. He's still bitter  there were only twelve grades.
BUFFY: He probably sat in math class thinking,  "There should be more math! This  could be mathier."
WILLOW: You don't think he ever got restless when he was little?
BUFFY: Are you kidding? His diapers were tweed.
GILES: Ah. There you are.
BUFFY: Morning. Say, is that tweed?
GILES: What? Oh. Well, yes. Now, tonight is a very important --
GILES: As an educator, it behooves me to set myself apart from you students by my mode of dress and demeanor.
BUFFY: Is it stuffy in here, or is it just you?
GILES: Laugh all you want, but the problem with this culture is its disregard for  decorum, which I believe has led to  the current pursuit of feel-good nihilism.
XANDER: What have I been saying for years?
WILLOW: That you'll die a virgin? Oh. The nihilism thing. Sorry. Missed the funny there.
BUFFY: So, what's on tap tonight that's so important? Uprising? Prophesied ritual? Preordained death-fest?
XANDER: Ah, the old standards.
GILES: A transport vehicle is delivering a supply of blood to the hospital.
BUFFY: Aha. Vampire meals-on-wheels.
GILES: Well, hopefully not. We should meet in front of the hospital at 8:30 sharp.  I'll bring the weaponry.
BUFFY: And I'll bring the party mix.
GILES: (stern look) Just don't be late.
BUFFY: Giles, have I ever let you down?
GILES: Do you want me to answer that, or shall I just glare?
JENNY: (smiling) Morning, England.
GILES: Hello, Ms... Jenny.
WILLOW: (aside, to Xander) Feel the passion.
JENNY: Willow--
WILLOW: (coughs) Coughing, not speaking.
JENNY: --we're still on for tomorrow?
XANDER: What's tomorrow?
JENNY: I'm reviewing some computer basics with a couple of students who have fallen behind. Willow's helping for extra credit.
XANDER: Hah! Those poor schlubs. Having to give up their Saturday--
JENNY: Nine a.m. okay with you, Xander?
BUFFY: (to Xander) You've got a bit of schlub on your shoe, there.
JENNY: Cordelia is going to meet us.
XANDER: Hey, gang, did you hear that? A  bonus day of class, plus Cordelia!  A little rectal surgery and it would  be the best day ever!
JENNY: (to Giles) Walk me to class?
GILES: Pleasure.
JENNY: Nice coat.
GILES: (for Buffy's benefit) Tweed, you know.
BUFFY: Look at them.
XANDER: A twosome of cuteness.
WILLOW: Can't you just imagine them getting together?
JENNY: Oh! Thank you so much for loaning me the Forrester book. It's wonderful.
GILES: I'm glad you enjoyed it.
JENNY: it was so romantic, so evocative.
GILES: That edition was my father's. I must have read it 20 times.
JENNY: You know how you have to dog-ear  your favorite pages so you can go  back to them?
GILES: (alarmed) You have to what?
JENNY: Well, I practically folded back every page. So I underlined the passages I really wanted to discuss.
GILES: (queasy) Underlined?
JENNY: But then I spilled coffee on it and I couldn't even read it.
GILES: Coffee. On the first edition.
JENNY: (smiles) I'm lying, Rupert. The book's fine. I just love to see you squirm.
GILES: Oh. Well, I trust I gave good squirm.
JENNY: Did anyone ever tell you you're kind of a fuddy duddy?
GILES: Nobody ever seems to tell me anything else.
JENNY: Did anyone ever tell you you're kind of a sexy fuddy duddy?
GILES: That part usually gets left out. I can't  imagine why.
JENNY: This weekend --
GILES: Would you like to go out?
JENNY: I think I'd like to stay in.
GILES: This Saturday night, then?
JENNY: Saturday night. I'll see if I can make you squirm.
GILES: Oh! Yes. I'm... yes. Put me down for squirminess. (beat) A suave person would have just shut up and walked away right then, wouldn't he?
JENNY: (smiles) Possibly.
GILES: Well, why don't I try now.
WINSLOW: Rupert Giles?
GILES: Yes?
WINSLOW: (flashes her badge) Detective Winslow. You're going to have to come with me.
GILES: Why?
WINSLOW: There was a homicide on campus last night. The victim had no identification.  But he was carrying this slip of paper  with your name and address on it.
GILES: My name?
CORDELIA: Well, evil just compounds evil, doesn't it. First I'm sentenced to a computer tutorial on Saturday, now I have to read some computer book. They have books about computers? Isn't that the point of computers, to replace books?
GILES: Cordelia, I'm a little busy just now...
CORDELIA: Oh, great. Can you help me with a ticket? it's totally bogus, a one way street, I was going one way --
GILES: Cordelia!
CORDELIA: What? why does everybody always  yell my name? I'm not deaf. And I  can take a hint.
CORDELIA: What's the hint?
GILES: To come back later.
CORDELIA: Yeah, when you've visited decaf-land.
GILES: Where is it you want me to go?
ATTENDANT: Have you had breakfast?
GILES: No.
ATTENDANT: That was probably a good idea.
WINSLOW: Do you know him?
GILES: Yes. I mean, I did. His name is Philip  Henry. He was a friend of mine in London.  I haven't spoken to him in twenty years.
WINSLOW: Can you think of any reason he might have wanted to contact you?
GILES: No...
WINSLOW: Do you know what that is? The tattoo?
GILES: No. No, I don't.
BUFFY: "Don't be late." Sheesh.
BUFFY: Giles, why is your phone busy when you're supposed to be here?
BUFFY: Operator, can you check a line for me...
BUFFY: Never mind. Sorry.
BUFFY: All's well that ends with cute E.R. doctors I always say.
BUFFY: Since when do doctors take deliveries?
DRIVER: Hey, no sampling the product.
BUFFY: Angel!
ANGEL: Buffy! Look out!
ANGEL: Incoming!
BUFFY: How did you know about this?
ANGEL: It's delivery day. Everybody knows about this. (re: ice chest of blood bags) They only ruined one bag.
BUFFY: Can you make sure the hospital gets the rest? (he nods) I'm worried about Giles. He was supposed to meet me here.
ANGEL: Maybe he's late.
BUFFY: Giles? Who counts tardiness as the eighth deadly sin?
ANGEL: Right. Go.
GILES: Buffy. It's late, are you all right?
BUFFY: I was going to ask you the same thing.
GILES: Yes, fine. I'm afraid I'm rather busy.  I'll see you Monday at school --
BUFFY: Giles, did you forget about the hospital?  Vampires? Bags of blood in handy carry  out packets?
GILES: Oh. Are you all right? Were you hurt?
BUFFY: No. I mean, my feelings a little. What's wrong?
GILES: Nothing. Nothing's wrong, I'm in the middle of an extremely important matter and I'm sorry but I'm just going to have to say good night now.
GILES: (into phone) I'm sorry to disturb you, I realize it's five in the morning there but I'm trying to reach Deirdre Page. My name is Rupert Giles, she knows me, it's very important...
GILES: I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.. when did she pass away? Oh dear, that recently. We were friends when we were young... my condolences.
GILES: So... you're back.
CORDELIA: School on a Saturday? That throws off my internal clock.
XANDER: When are we going to have to use computers in real life, anyway?
JENNY: Let's see, there's home, school, work, games--
XANDER: Computers are on the way out. I think paper is about to make a big comeback.
WILLOW: And the abacus.
XANDER: Yeah. You don't see enough abaci.
JENNY: All right, the first thing we want to do is... (sees) ...Buffy.
XANDER: Huh? Did I fall asleep already?
WILLOW: Ahhh. You miss your friends.
XANDER: Sit here, Buffs. De-militarize the zone between me and Cordelia.
CORDELIA: And de-lice him while you're at it.
BUFFY: (to Jenny) Actually I wanted to talk to you for a second.
JENNY: Is something wrong?
XANDER: Is it some crisis that requires instant  action -- very far from here?
BUFFY: I'm not sure...
XANDER: Think, dammit! Buffy, don't make me beg.
BUFFY: Well, it's Giles.
XANDER: A loved one, good...
WILLOW: He's all right, isn't he?
BUFFY: I don't know. He didn't show up last night when he was supposed to, and then I went by his place and he was acting... well, very Anti-Giles.
WILLOW: You went by his place? He has a place? (off their looks) Of course he has a... I just never think of him living anywhere outside the library. So there was weirdness?
BUFFY: He wouldn't let me in. He looked terrible. And I think he might have been... uh, I think he was drinking.
JENNY: He was home alone drinking?
WILLOW: But... tea, right?
BUFFY: It wasn't tea, will.
XANDER: Yup. I knew this would happen. Nobody can be wound as straight and narrow as Giles without a dark side erupting. My Uncle Roary was the stodgiest taxidermist you ever met -- by day -- by night it was booze and whores and fur flying... were there any whores?
WILLOW: Xander.
BUFFY: He was alone.
XANDER: Give it time.
BUFFY: None of you have noticed anything different about him lately?
WILLOW: No.
JENNY: Not really.
BUFFY: Haven't seen anything weird?
XANDER: No.
CORDELIA: He was perfectly normal yesterday when I saw him talking to the police.
BUFFY: And you waited until now to tell us because...?
CORDELIA: I didn't think it was important.
XANDER: We understand. It wasn't about you.
JENNY: What were the police talking to him about?
CORDELIA: Don't tell me, I know this one... something about a... homicide.
BUFFY: I'm calling him right now.
BUFFY: I know you, you ran that costume shop.
ETHAN: I'm pleased you remember.
BUFFY: You sold me that dress for Halloween and nearly got us all killed.
ETHAN: But you looked great.
ETHAN: So now we're even?
BUFFY: I'll let you know when we're even. (then) I'm going to ask you once again and then I'm pretty much going straight to the pummeling: what are you doing here?
ETHAN: Snooping around.
BUFFY: Honesty. Nice touch.
ETHAN: It's one of my virtues. (then) Not really.
BUFFY: I got a great idea...
BUFFY: ...why don't I just call the police and have you arrested for breaking and entering and get back to my fun Saturday.
ETHAN: Yes, the police. They'll have so many questions -- they'll really need Rupert to answer them all.
BUFFY: You know Giles?
ETHAN: We go back. Way back. You wouldn't happen to know where he is, would you?
GUY: You're marked. I'll kill you for this!  I'll kill you all!
GILES: Hello?
BUFFY: Giles, it's me.
GILES: Buffy. Unless this is an emergency, I'll see you in school on Monday --
BUFFY: What's the Mark of Eyghon?
BUFFY: Giles?
ETHAN: Cat got his tongue?
BUFFY: I'm in your office with someone who claims to be an old friend of yours: Ethan Rayne.
GILES: He's there with you?
GILES: Buffy, listen to me. You're in great danger with Ethan there. I want you to put down the phone and get out of the library as quickly as possible.
BUFFY: I'm not going anywhere until you start giving me some answers --
GILES: Buffy!
BUFFY: (to Xander, re: Ethan) Don't let him get away!
XANDER: That'll teach you to mess with me when I've got a... girl.
WILLOW: I'm not getting close enough to feel his pulse, but I've gotta say he looks  pretty dead.
XANDER: Except for the walking around and attacking Buffy part.
ETHAN: He's dead. (to Phil) Sorry, Philip. Really I am.
BUFFY: You know him?
ETHAN: Knew him.
CORDELIA: Hey, you don't speak until we tell you to speak.
BUFFY: Uh, Cordelia, I did tell him to speak.
GILES: Is everyone all right?
CORDELIA: Super. I kicked a guy.
JENNY: We're okay.
XANDER: Dead guy there interrupted our tutorial. (to Philip) Been meaning to thank you for that.
GILES: It... can't be.
ETHAN: Oh yes it can. Hello, Ripper.
GILES: I thought I told you to leave town.
ETHAN: You did. I didn't. Shop's lease is paid  through the end of the month.
CORDELIA: Why'd he call him Ripper?
GILES: You should have left when I told you!
CORDELIA: Oh.
GILES: You've put these people in danger. These are people I care about.
CORDELIA: Wow, even me?
ETHAN: If you care so much about them why didn't you leave town. I know you've been having the dreams, I have, we both know what's coming.
BUFFY: What dreams, what's going on?
GILES: I...
ETHAN: Tell her, Ripper.
BUFFY: Giles?
GILES: Jenny!
ETHAN: Nooo!
WILLOW: That's something you don't see  every day.
CORDELIA: Oh my god! I'll be in therapy till I'm thirty!
GILES: Jenny?
JENNY: (holding her head) Ow...
GILES: Careful, careful. Can you stand?
JENNY: I think so.
CORDELIA: (sotto; to Xander) This is what happens when you have school on Saturday.
GILES: Here, lean on me.
GILES: It'll be all right...
JENNY: Promise?
GILES: I promise.
JENNY: I believe you.
GILES: How's your head?
JENNY: Throbbing.
BUFFY: Giles, what's going on?
GILES: It's... complicated, Buffy, and frankly  it's private.
BUFFY: I don't care from private, I care from  dead guys attacking us, I care from  you Lost Weekending in your apartment.
GILES: I wasn't... I just had to work out a solution.
BUFFY: Solution is good. Why don't we share?  What's the mark of Eyghon?
GILES: This is not your battle, and as your watcher, I'm telling you in no uncertain terms: stay out of it. I've got to get Jenny home.
JENNY: Home. That sounds so good right now.
BUFFY: We have work to do. Willow, I want you to find out anything and everything you can about the mark  of Eyghon.
WILLOW: So what Giles just said about staying out of it --
BUFFY: Thrill, as I ignore it completely. He needs our help and he's going to get it.
WILLOW: I can try the net, but the mark of Eyghon sounds like a Giles and his books kind of deal.
BUFFY: So we hit the books.
BUFFY: Xander, how do you feel about rifling through Giles' personal files, see if you can shed some light.
XANDER: I feel pretty good about it. Does that make me a sociopath?
BUFFY: What?
CORDELIA: What about me? I care about Giles.
BUFFY: Work with Xander.
CORDELIA: Well, when I say "care", I mean --
BUFFY: Cordelia.
CORDELIA: Okay, okay.
JENNY: Thanks for bringing me here. I'm not quite ready to be home alone just yet.
JENNY: It's strong. (drinks some more) It's helping.
GILES: You need it after what you've been through.
GILES: Jenny, I'm so sorry about this. I never  meant for you to get involved in any  of this.
JENNY: So I got involved. That's what happens  when two people... get involved.
GILES: I will have to get you home, soon. It's not -- I'm not a safe person to be around right now.
JENNY: Nothing's safe in this world, Rupert. Don't you know that by now?
WILLOW: Ah! Aha! It's not Egyptian it's Etruscan,  mistaken for Egyptian by the design  pattern but any fool can see it pre-dates  their iconology...
WILLOW: Look at this: the Mark Of Eyghon, worn by his initiates. (reads) "Eyghon, also called the Sleepwalker, can only exist in this reality by possessing an unconscious host. Temporary possession imbues the host with a euphoric feeling of power."
BUFFY: What about not temporary?
WILLOW: "Unless the proper rituals are observed,  the possession is permanent, and Eyghon  will be born from within the host."
CORDELIA: I'm guessing, "Eew."
WILLOW: Hey, listen. "Once called, Eyghon can also take possession of the dead, but its demonic energy soon disintegrates the host and it must jump to the nearest dead or unconscious person to continue living."
BUFFY: I still don't understand what this has to do with Giles.
WILLOW: (has been skimming) Well, I don't know about Giles, but ancient sects used to induce possession for bacchanals and orgies.
XANDER: Okay, "Giles" and "orgies" in the same  sentence. Coulda lived without that.
BUFFY: Wait a minute. The dead guy. He's all puddly now.
CORDELIA: So the demon is gone. There was no one dead to jump into. I mean, we're all not dead, right?
BUFFY: No one dead...
XANDER: But someone unconscious.
GILES: What was that?
JENNY: What was what?
GILES: I thought I heard something.
JENNY: I didn't. (takes tea) Thanks.
GILES: Drink it and then I'll take you home.
JENNY: You could take me home... (sets tea down) ...or you could take advantage of me in my weakened state.
BUFFY: Thank you, operator.
BUFFY: No answer at Ms. Calendar's and Giles' line is out of order. I'm getting over there.
GILES: Jenny, I am attracted to you...
JENNY: Good.
GILES: But this isn't the right time.
JENNY: There's never been a better time.
GILES: No, it's not right, I'd be taking advantage.
JENNY: God, you don't change, do you.
GILES: Uh...?
JENNY: "It's not right, wouldn't be proper..."
JENNY: (demon voice) "... people might get hurt."
GILES: What's...?
JENNY: (demon-voiced) "You're like a woman, Ripper, you cry at every funeral. You never had the strength for me, you don't deserve me. But guess what, you've got me -- UNDER YOUR SKIN!
JENNY: Was it good for you?
JENNY: You never had the stomach. But that's okay, I'm about to rip it out.
BUFFY: Back off. Just stay back.
JENNY: (laughs) Three down, two to go! Be seeing you.
BUFFY: Are you all right?
GILES: Jenny... Oh, God...
BUFFY: Giles, how do we stop this thing?
GILES: God, what have I done?
BUFFY: Talk to me! Giles, you're scaring me.
GILES: I'm sorry...
BUFFY: (hurt anger) Don't be sorry! Be Giles! Come on, we fight monsters. They show up, they scare us, I beat them up, and they leave. This isn't any different.
GILES: It is different.
BUFFY: Because you don't know how to stop it.
GILES: Because I created it.
WILLOW: Did you find anything?
XANDER: The most meticulous banking and phone records you've ever seen, and this.
XANDER: Apparently Giles wasn't always Giles.
WILLOW: That's Giles?
CORDELIA: Wow, was he like in a band?
XANDER: Once upon a time boys and girls, Giles was us.
GILES: Studying history at Oxford and of course the occult by night. I hated it. The boring grind of school, the pressure of my "destiny". So I dropped out. I went to London, fell in with the worst crowd that would have me. We practiced magicks. Small stuff, for pleasure or gain. And then Ethan and I discovered something a little bigger.
BUFFY: Eyghon.
GILES: Yes. We put one of us into a deep sleep and the others would summon him. It was an extraordinary high. God, we were fools.
BUFFY: You couldn't control it.
GILES: One of us, Randall, he lost control. Eyghon took him whole. We tried to exorcise the demon from Randall, but it killed him. We killed him.
BUFFY: God...
GILES: We thought we were free of the demon after that. But it's back. And one by one it will kill us all.
BUFFY: Three down, two to go.
BUFFY: Then it's going after Ethan. I better  beat it there.
GILES: We better.
BUFFY: You're barely mobile and speed is of the serious essence.
GILES: Buffy, I don't know how to stop it without... without killing Jenny.
BUFFY: I got the guys working on it. I'll try to contain her till we can figure something.
GILES: Buffy!
GILES: I'm sorry.
BUFFY: I know.
MAN: Whoa there, Spritzer. It's okay.
MAN: (to dog) Come on, there's nothing to be afraid of. (then, to unseen person) Spritzer's a friendly little guy. He really  likes people.
CALENDAR: I really like dogs.
MAN: Spritzer...
BUFFY: Ethan...
BUFFY: I'm not here to hurt you... I'm sorry to say. Giles told me everything. It's coming for you. We've got to stop it.
ETHAN: And you came to protect me. I'm touched.
BUFFY: Don't worry, it's nothing personal: to protect Giles I have to protect you.
ETHAN: How does Ripper inspire such goodness?
BUFFY: Because he's Giles.
ETHAN: And I'm not. Still, lucky me.
BUFFY: Lucky you.
ETHAN: Well, we can't run. Eyghon will find us. This mark might as well be a homing beacon.
BUFFY: That's all right. I'm not big on running anyway.
ETHAN: Aren't we manly.
BUFFY: One of us is. You're gonna hide till it's over.
ETHAN: Excellent plan.
BUFFY: Is there a way in through the back?
ETHAN: There's a door, but it's locked. I think  it's solid.
BUFFY: Well, we can set you up back there. Come on.
ETHAN: Oh, no...
ETHAN: ...ladies first.
ETHAN: Wakey, wakey. You don't want to miss the fun.
BUFFY: What fun?
ETHAN: Your initiation.
BUFFY: You know what? I'm not real interested in joining your club.
ETHAN: Too late. I already voted you in. I hope you appreciate this is nothing personal, Buffy. I actually kind of like you. It's just...
ETHAN: I like myself more. You know, if you look at it karmically, this is very big for your soul: you're taking my place with the demon, giving so that others may live.
BUFFY: I'm going to kill you. Will that blow  the whole karma thing?
ETHAN: Now, you might feel a slight sting at first. But that'll go away once the searing pain kicks in.
ETHAN: You can go ahead and scream.
WILLOW: We have to figure out how to kill this thing. And we have to do it fast.
XANDER: (re: book) Hot lava.
WILLOW: That's for a heretic.
XANDER: Oh, yeah. Okay, bury a potato. No, that's for warts. (looking at the cover) Who writes these things?
CORDELIA: Duhh. I've got the solution, right here. (points to her book) To kill a demon, cut its head off.
XANDER: Great work, Cor.
CORDELIA: You could have done it -- not really.
XANDER: Yeah, we'll just find Ms. Calendar and then we'll decapitate her. She can be the first headless computer teacher, think anyone'll notice?
CORDELIA: You know what you need, Xander -- besides a year's supply of acne cream -- a brain.
XANDER: That's it, twelve years of you, I'm snapping. I don't care you're a girl,  I'm throwing down. (gets in a fight stance) Come on.
CORDELIA: I've seen you fight, don't think I can't take you.
XANDER: Give it your best shot!
WILLOW: Heyyy! We don't have time for this. Our friends are in trouble. Now we have to put our heads together and get them out of it. And if you two aren't  with me a hundred and ten percent then  get the hell out of my library!
CORDELIA: We're sorry.
XANDER: We'll be good.
WILLOW: We've done the research, we've got to think how to use it.
XANDER: Okay, what if we find another dead body for the demon to jump into?
CORDELIA: (picking up on it) Yeah. At the cemetery.
WILLOW: That won't kill the demon; it'll just give it a change of scenery.
WILLOW: Oh! Oh! Oh! I've got it!
XANDER: She's good.
ETHAN: Perhaps I missed my calling as an artist.
BUFFY: Listen to me, Ethan. This is a BAD IDEA. You're dealing with something very dangerous.
ETHAN: But this'll throw Eyghon off my scent.
BUFFY: I'm not talking about Eyghon.
ETHAN: Gosh, you are spunky. Relax, I'm done with you. It's my turn now...
GILES: Ethan... Oh, no...
ETHAN: I hate to mutilate and run but...
JENNY: It is your time.
GILES: Take me.
GILES: Buffy, get out of here!
BUFFY: No!
CALENDAR: I've been waiting a long time to do this.
GILES: He's killing her.
WILLOW: Trust me. This is going to work...
CORDELIA: Did we kill it?
BUFFY: It's in Angel!
WILLOW: (much less confidently) This is going to work.
GILES: Jenny...?
JENNY: Rupert.
GILES: It's okay. I've got you.
BUFFY: You knew that if the demon was in danger it would jump into the nearest dead guy.
ANGEL: I put it in danger.
WILLOW: And it jumped.
ANGEL: But I've had a demon inside me for a couple hundred years just waiting for a good fight.
BUFFY: Winner and still champion.
XANDER: Uh, I think that Ethan guy disappeared.
BUFFY: Darn. I really wanted to hit him till he bled.
CORDELIA: Well, at least it's over.
BUFFY: The worst thing is, I was saving up for some very important shoes. Now I gotta blow my allowance getting this stupid tattoo removed. I just hope mom doesn't see it first.
XANDER: Putting the demon into Angel was pretty brill, Will.
WILLOW: I wasn't sure it would work.
BUFFY: But it did.
XANDER: Like a charm.
BUFFY: Maybe you should consider a career as a Watcher.
WILLOW: Oh no, I don't think I could take the stress.
XANDER: And the dental plan is crap.
WILLOW: I don't know how Giles does it.
BUFFY: I don't think he has a choice.
GILES: Jenny. Jenny --
JENNY: Rupert. Hi.
GILES: I tried to call you last night. See how you were.
JENNY: Yeah, I left the phone off the hook. I seem to need a lot of sleep lately.
GILES: But you're alright? Is there something  you need?
JENNY: (shakes her head) I'm fine. I mean, I'm not "running around, wind in my hair, the hills are alive with the Sound of Music" fine, but I'm coping.
GILES: I would like to help.
JENNY: I know.
GILES: Perhaps we could talk some time. Have dinner, or a drink -- when you're feeling stronger.
JENNY: Sure. Some time.
JENNY: Yeah, some time... I better get to class.
GILES: Of course.
BUFFY: How is she?
GILES: The hills are not alive.
