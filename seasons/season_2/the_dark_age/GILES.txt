(shouts above music) Must we have such noise during your calisthenics?
I know music. Music has notes. This is noise.
Wonderful. You work on your muscle tone while my brains dribble out my ears.
Ah. Very good. The rest is silence.
Ah. There you are.
What? Oh. Well, yes. Now, tonight is a very important --
As an educator, it behooves me to set myself apart from you students by my mode of dress and demeanor.
Laugh all you want, but the problem with this culture is its disregard for  decorum, which I believe has led to  the current pursuit of feel-good nihilism.
A transport vehicle is delivering a supply of blood to the hospital.
Well, hopefully not. We should meet in front of the hospital at 8:30 sharp.  I'll bring the weaponry.
(stern look) Just don't be late.
Do you want me to answer that, or shall I just glare?
Hello, Ms... Jenny.
Pleasure.
(for Buffy's benefit) Tweed, you know.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
That edition was my father's. I must have read it 20 times.
(alarmed) You have to what?
(queasy) Underlined?
Coffee. On the first edition.
Oh. Well, I trust I gave good squirm.
Nobody ever seems to tell me anything else.
That part usually gets left out. I can't  imagine why.
Would you like to go out?
This Saturday night, then?
Oh! Yes. I'm... yes. Put me down for squirminess. (beat) A suave person would have just shut up and walked away right then, wouldn't he?
Well, why don't I try now.
Yes?
Why?
My name?
Cordelia, I'm a little busy just now...
Cordelia!
To come back later.
Where is it you want me to go?
No.
Yes. I mean, I did. His name is Philip  Henry. He was a friend of mine in London.  I haven't spoken to him in twenty years.
No...
No. No, I don't.
Buffy. It's late, are you all right?
Yes, fine. I'm afraid I'm rather busy.  I'll see you Monday at school --
Oh. Are you all right? Were you hurt?
Nothing. Nothing's wrong, I'm in the middle of an extremely important matter and I'm sorry but I'm just going to have to say good night now.
(into phone) I'm sorry to disturb you, I realize it's five in the morning there but I'm trying to reach Deirdre Page. My name is Rupert Giles, she knows me, it's very important...
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.. when did she pass away? Oh dear, that recently. We were friends when we were young... my condolences.
So... you're back.
Hello?
Buffy. Unless this is an emergency, I'll see you in school on Monday --
He's there with you?
Buffy, listen to me. You're in great danger with Ethan there. I want you to put down the phone and get out of the library as quickly as possible.
Buffy!
Is everyone all right?
It... can't be.
I thought I told you to leave town.
You should have left when I told you!
You've put these people in danger. These are people I care about.
I...
Jenny!
Jenny?
Careful, careful. Can you stand?
Here, lean on me.
It'll be all right...
I promise.
How's your head?
It's... complicated, Buffy, and frankly  it's private.
I wasn't... I just had to work out a solution.
This is not your battle, and as your watcher, I'm telling you in no uncertain terms: stay out of it. I've got to get Jenny home.
You need it after what you've been through.
Jenny, I'm so sorry about this. I never  meant for you to get involved in any  of this.
I will have to get you home, soon. It's not -- I'm not a safe person to be around right now.
What was that?
I thought I heard something.
Drink it and then I'll take you home.
Jenny, I am attracted to you...
But this isn't the right time.
No, it's not right, I'd be taking advantage.
Uh...?
What's...?
Jenny... Oh, God...
God, what have I done?
I'm sorry...
It is different.
Because I created it.
Studying history at Oxford and of course the occult by night. I hated it. The boring grind of school, the pressure of my "destiny". So I dropped out. I went to London, fell in with the worst crowd that would have me. We practiced magicks. Small stuff, for pleasure or gain. And then Ethan and I discovered something a little bigger.
Yes. We put one of us into a deep sleep and the others would summon him. It was an extraordinary high. God, we were fools.
One of us, Randall, he lost control. Eyghon took him whole. We tried to exorcise the demon from Randall, but it killed him. We killed him.
We thought we were free of the demon after that. But it's back. And one by one it will kill us all.
We better.
Buffy, I don't know how to stop it without... without killing Jenny.
Buffy!
I'm sorry.
Ethan... Oh, no...
Take me.
Buffy, get out of here!
He's killing her.
Jenny...?
It's okay. I've got you.
Jenny. Jenny --
I tried to call you last night. See how you were.
But you're alright? Is there something  you need?
I would like to help.
Perhaps we could talk some time. Have dinner, or a drink -- when you're feeling stronger.
Of course.
The hills are not alive.
I don't imagine she'll ever really forgive me. Maybe she shouldn't.
I never wanted you to see that side of me.
Most grown-ups are.
Some of them are even very short- sighted, foolish people.
Uh, yes. Need to concentrate on your flexibility.
That isn't music, it's just meaningless sounds.
Yes, thank you.
The Bay City Rollers, now that's music.
