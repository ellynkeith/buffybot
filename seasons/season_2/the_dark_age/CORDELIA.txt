Well, evil just compounds evil, doesn't it. First I'm sentenced to a computer tutorial on Saturday, now I have to read some computer book. They have books about computers? Isn't that the point of computers, to replace books?
Oh, great. Can you help me with a ticket? it's totally bogus, a one way street, I was going one way --
What? why does everybody always  yell my name? I'm not deaf. And I  can take a hint.
What's the hint?
Yeah, when you've visited decaf-land.
School on a Saturday? That throws off my internal clock.
And de-lice him while you're at it.
He was perfectly normal yesterday when I saw him talking to the police.
I didn't think it was important.
Don't tell me, I know this one... something about a... homicide.
Hey, you don't speak until we tell you to speak.
Super. I kicked a guy.
Why'd he call him Ripper?
Oh.
Wow, even me?
Oh my god! I'll be in therapy till I'm thirty!
(sotto; to Xander) This is what happens when you have school on Saturday.
What about me? I care about Giles.
Well, when I say "care", I mean --
Okay, okay.
I'm guessing, "Eew."
So the demon is gone. There was no one dead to jump into. I mean, we're all not dead, right?
Wow, was he like in a band?
Duhh. I've got the solution, right here. (points to her book) To kill a demon, cut its head off.
You could have done it -- not really.
You know what you need, Xander -- besides a year's supply of acne cream -- a brain.
I've seen you fight, don't think I can't take you.
We're sorry.
(picking up on it) Yeah. At the cemetery.
Did we kill it?
Well, at least it's over.
