Rupert Giles?
(flashes her badge) Detective Winslow. You're going to have to come with me.
There was a homicide on campus last night. The victim had no identification.  But he was carrying this slip of paper  with your name and address on it.
Do you know him?
Can you think of any reason he might have wanted to contact you?
Do you know what that is? The tattoo?
