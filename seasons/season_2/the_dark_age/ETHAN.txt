I'm pleased you remember.
But you looked great.
So now we're even?
Snooping around.
It's one of my virtues. (then) Not really.
Yes, the police. They'll have so many questions -- they'll really need Rupert to answer them all.
We go back. Way back. You wouldn't happen to know where he is, would you?
Cat got his tongue?
He's dead. (to Phil) Sorry, Philip. Really I am.
Knew him.
Oh yes it can. Hello, Ripper.
You did. I didn't. Shop's lease is paid  through the end of the month.
If you care so much about them why didn't you leave town. I know you've been having the dreams, I have, we both know what's coming.

Nooo!
And you came to protect me. I'm touched.
How does Ripper inspire such goodness?
And I'm not. Still, lucky me.
Well, we can't run. Eyghon will find us. This mark might as well be a homing beacon.

Excellent plan.
There's a door, but it's locked. I think  it's solid.

Too late. I already voted you in. I hope you appreciate this is nothing personal, Buffy. I actually kind of like you. It's just...

Now, you might feel a slight sting at first. But that'll go away once the searing pain kicks in.
You can go ahead and scream.
Perhaps I missed my calling as an artist.
But this'll throw Eyghon off my scent.
Gosh, you are spunky. Relax, I'm done with you. It's my turn now...
I hate to mutilate and run but...
