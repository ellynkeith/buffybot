Home sweet home.
You were there? Oh please.
Would it kill ya', little mouthwash every couple hundred years?
Spike. You're that anointed guy. I read about you. And you got Slayer problems. You know what I find works real good with Slayers? Killing them.
A lot faster than fatboy here. (to Big Ugly, who chokes and grunts) Doncha' think? (more gagging: to the Anointed) He agrees. Where was I? Oh yeah, I did a couple Slayers in my time. Don't like to brag. Oh, who am I kidding, I love to brag. There was one Slayer, during the Boxer Rebellion -
We're getting along.
Yeah, he's a big noise in these parts. Anointed, and all that.
I got you.
That's what you are.
It's done, baby.
I'll chop her into pieces.
(to the Anointed One) So, how about this Slayer. Is she tough?
Go get something to eat.
Where's a phone. I need to call the police. There's some big guy out back trying to bite someone.
Nice work, baby.
You'll find out on Saturday.
I kill you.
Who do you want me to be?
Those two losers who thought they were good enough for you?
They got sleepy.
And you got something a whole lot better.
Darling, are you gonna eat something?
You nearly died in Prague, Baby.  That idiot mob… this is the place  for us. The Hellmouth'll restore  you. Put color in your cheeks. Metaphorically speaking.
And then, God, this town will burn.
But baby, none of that's gonna happen unless you EAT.
St. Vigeous is coming up. Should be a party. And I need a party. Man, I'm restless. Can't wait to ice that Slayer.
Dru…
Never happen. Alright, I'll go get chanty with the fellahs. But you  have to do me one favor.
What can I say? I couldn't wait.
No one gets out! Especially the girl!
And the Slayer?
(tightens death grip on parent's neck) You don't know?
Slayer… here kitty, kitty…
…and use their bones to bash your head in.
Someone's in the ceiling.
Use your head…
Angelus. I'll be damned.
I did. I'm surrounded by idiots. What's new with you?
Come up against this Slayer yet?
People still fall for that Anne Rice routine? What a world.
Haven't seen you in the killing fields  for an age.
No, you never were. So why are you so scared of this Slayer?
Time was, you'd've taken her out in a heartbeat. Now look at you. This tortured thing is an act, right? You're not housebroken?
Don't be silly. We're old friends. We'll do it together. Let's drink to it.
You think you can fool me? You were my sire, man… you were my Yoda!
Not us! Not demons. Man, I can't believe this - you Uncle Tom!
I just like 'em. Make me feel all  manly.
Yeah, I messed up your doilies and  stuff. But I just got so bored! Tell you  what. As a personal favor from me to  you. I'll make it quick. It won't hurt a bit.
Now that hurt.
(bitterly) Women.
I was close, baby, but…
A Slayer with family and friends.  That sure as hell wasn't in the brochure.
Yeah, a party.
How's the Annoying One?
Figures. Suppose I better go make nice.
Yeah, I, uh… I offer penance…
It was… rash… and if I had to do it  all over again… ah who am I kidding?  I'd do it exactly the same, only I'd do  THIS first.
Let's see what's on TV.
