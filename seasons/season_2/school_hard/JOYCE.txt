What's wrong?
Life is hard, dear.
I got the mail.
Which included a reminder notice about parent teacher night Thursday.
Which your were planning on telling me about…?
Uh huh. So what do you think your teachers will tell me about you?
And this absorption rate, how is it reflected in your homework and test scores?
Whether or not she's ever going out with her friends again.
What about your principal?
I look forward to meeting him.
Look, sweetheart, life is more than grades and test scores and not getting kicked out of school.
But we moved once because of you getting in trouble. And I had to start a new business - not to mention a new life - in a whole new town.
What I don't want is to be  disappointed in you again.
Wait till you have a job.
Hi Willow. (to Buffy) Hi honey. Did you do all this?
Well I believe I've seen every  classroom on campus. And in each  one your teachers had miraculously  just stepped out.
Hello. I'm Joyce Summers, Buffy's mother.
In the car. Now.
I didn't get much of a look but, is there  something wrong with their faces?
Buffy are you crazy? I know  you've been… (re: Snyder) …accused of fighting and other  things but those guys are serious…  you can't go out there.
Why don't you sit down…
Well then I guess the danger is over.
Don't be an idiot!
Oh yeah.
Buffy! Are you okay?
Buffy, get out of here! We'll be  okay.
You're coming, too.
You get the hell away from my daughter!
No one… lays a finger… on  my little girl.
Principal Snyder told me you were a troublemaker. And I could care less. (turns to her) I have a daughter who can take care  of herself. Who's brave and resourceful and thinks of others when there's a  crisis. No matter who you hang out  with or what dumb teenage stuff you  think you have to do, I'm gonna sleep  better knowing all that.
At LEAST a week and a half.
