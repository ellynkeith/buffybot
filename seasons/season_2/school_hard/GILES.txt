There's nothing in the Chronicles about an extraneous lunar cycle.
Vampires.
Ms. Calendar has been researching - surfing on her computer. According to her calendar, this Saturday is the  Night of Saint Vigeous.
He led a crusade. Of vampires. They swept through Edessa, Harran, and points east.
You're being a tad flip, don't you think? This is serious.
You know what happens when you let your life interfere with your slaying.
You just need to keep the two things separate.
Saturday will require a great deal of preparation.
Your help will be appreciated. But when it comes to battle, Buffy must be prepared to fight alone. You are,  after all, a slay-
slay…ve. Slave. You're all slaves to the… television. You young people nowadays. Goodbye.
…that's what the other vampire called him? (Buffy nods) Sounds a little unorthodox.
(thumbing through diaries) He may have gone by a different name in times past…
I'm sure he's no worse than any other creature you've faced -
You know him?
Yes, well we've slightly more urgent things to discuss.
Angel, do you know if this Spike fellow has any other names?
Well, there you are…
(re: diaries) Our new friend Spike. "Known as  William the Bloody, earned his nickname  by torturning his victims with railroad  spikes…" Ahh, but here's some good  news, he's barely two hundred, not even  as old as Angel… oh…
I think your suggestion of running away this Saturday may have been a good one. Spike has fought two Slayers in the last century. And killed them both.
-- the door!
They cut the phones. (to Xander) There's an old boarded cellar behind the stacks. You can get out that way. Find Angel. He knows about Spike, we need him.
No one's going to be all right if we don't get some help.
I'm the Watcher, I'm responsible for  her, I have to go.
Push them back the minute I'm -
He got out through the stacks. He's getting Angel.
I should go with you and fight.
Bloody well right I will. What's your plan?
Watch your back…
Buffy! Look out -
Right through the back…
