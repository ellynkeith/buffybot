(to Buffy) Are you sure you're ready to fight Angel?
Don't say that. You're gonna pass everything. I'm gonna get you  through this semester if I have to sweat blood.
It was only metaphor blood.
(to Buffy) Sixth period, after my computer class, we'll rock on Chemistry.
I love it. I really do.
I haven't read anything about -- Oh! I get it.
(to Buffy) Do you want to come by tonight, do some cramming?
Again? Do you really expect Angel to turn up tonight?
Well, sure it does, see. . .  (looks at Buffy's work) Oh, no, that doesn't make any sense.
It is. But at least you know that! So you're learning.
(re: notebook) Oh, I see your problem.
Will you stop that? You're not stupid. You've just had a lot on your mind. You can do all of this real easily but if you're just gonna give up then <b>don't waste my time</b>.

Well, I. . . I've been going through her files and reading up and. . . I've been sort of checking out the black arts. Just for fun -- or, educational fun. I might be able to work this.
And I don't want danger. "No" to danger. But I might be the best person to do this.
Xander --
(to Buffy) What do you want to do?
Okay, can somebody explain the whole 'he will suck the world into Hell' thing? That's the part I'm not loving.
We don't know where they are. They moved after Giles torched their house.
I don't want to be only hope. I crumble under pressure. Let's have another hope.
I need a day, maybe. And I need an Orb of Thesulah, whatever that is.
(to Buffy) This means I can't help you study for tomorrow's finals.
I'm not sure. I just want to cross check --
I need maybe half an hour once we're set up.
Not dead, nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum, I call.
Let him know the pain of humanity, gods -- reach your wizened hands to me, give me the soul of --
