God, are you disgusting.
This is really an unforgettable smell. This is the stench of death you're giving off here. And the look says crazy homeless guy, it's not good.
What are you gonna do, bite me? Oh, horrors! A Vampire!
Oh, but you're not gonna bite me 'cause of your poor tortured <b>soul</b>, it's so sad, a vampire with a soul, how poignant. I may physically vomit right here.
Let's take a walk. Come on.
(to the passerby) <b>What</b>? Yes, he's my lover, you mustn't <b>judge us</b>!
God, I hate people.
What are you eating, like a rat once a month? You're skin and bones here. Butcher shops are throwing away more blood in a day than you could stand. Good blood. You lived in the world  a little bit you'd know that.
And I want to know who <b>you</b> are.
Not yet. I'm looking to find out. 'Cause you could go either way here.
Nobody understands me. It's my curse.
(to the vendor) Dog me. (to Angel) There are three kinds of people that no one understands. Geniuses,  madmen, and guys that mumble. My name is Whistler. Anyway,  lately it is. My real name is hard to pronounce unless you're a dolphin.
A demon, technically. But I'm not a bad guy -- not all demons are dedicated to the destruction of all life. Someone has to maintain balance, you know. Good and evil can't exist without each other, blah blah blah. I'm not like a good fairy or anything,  I'm just trying to make it all balance -- do I come off defensive?
I mean you could become an even more useless rodent than you are  right now, or you could become. . . someone. A person. Someone to be counted.
You've been alone for what, ninety years? And what an impressive package you are. The stink guy.
<b>You're annoying me</b>! The self pity thing is not gonna bring in the chicks. It's a bore.
I want you to see something. It's happening very soon, we'd need to leave now. You see, and then you tell me what you want to do.
She's gonna have it tough, that Slayer. She's just a kid. And the world is full of big bad things.
Jeez, look at you. She must be prettier than the last Slayer. (Angel looks down) It's not gonna be easy. The more you live in the world the more you see how apart from it you are. And this is dangerous work. Right now you couldn't go three rounds  with a fruit fly.
Okay.
See? Again you're annoying me.
