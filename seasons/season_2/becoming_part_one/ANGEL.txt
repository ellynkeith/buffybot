We'll come back when we've found a bit more cash money. Keep the girls warm.  (to his friend) Come on. We'll sneak in and take some of my father's silver. He'll never miss it. Eats with his hands, the pig.
Or why don't you rest here.
So I'd ask myself, what is a lady of your station doing alone in an alley with the reputation that this one has?
In that case I would offer myself as escort. To protect  you from harm, and to while away the dull hours.
It's often been said.
Has a challenge been made, then?
My lady, you will find that with the exception of an honest day's work there is no challenge  I am not prepared to face. (reaches her, peers) God, but you're a pretty thing. Where are you from?
Never been anywhere, myself. Always wanted to see the world, but. . .
Could you, then?
Sounds exciting.
I'm not afraid. Show me. Show me your world.
Yes, my love. It will.
Uh, uh, two days? That's not very long. You must sin a great deal to be back so soon.
Hush, child. The Lord is very forgiving. Tell me your sins.
Go on.
Hush, child. The Lord has a plan for all creatures. Even a devil child like you.
Yes, you're a spawn of Satan, all the hail Mary's in the world aren't going to help. The Lord will use you and then smite you down, he's like that.
Fulfill his plan for you, child. Be evil. Perform evil works. Attack the less fortunate. You can start small: laugh at a cripple. You'll feel better. Just give in.
We all do, at first. World doesn't work that way.
Very well. Uh, ten Our Fathers and an act of contrition.  Does that sound good?
God is watching you.
What did it say?
What did the moon tell you? Did you have a vision?  Is something coming?
Where?
You can see all that in your head?
Oh, my. . .
Oh yeah. Don't worry though. Soon it'll stop.
Soon it'll scream.
Where am I?
Killed? I don't. . .
Oh. . . no. . . no. . .
Let's see. . . I'll have one of these. (points at it) To go.
Be careful. I don't want this thing cracked. Your weak imitations of life depend on it. (to Dru, re: Doug) Save me some.
Spike, boy, you never did learn your history.
Acathla, the demon, came forth to swallow the world. It was killed by a virtuous knight who pierced the demon's heart before it could draw breath to perform the act. Acathla  turned to stone, as demons sometimes do, and was buried where neither man nor demon would be wont to look. Unless of course they're putting up low rent housing. Boys?
Someone worthy. . .
And every creature living on this planet will go to Hell. My friends,  we're about to make history. . .  (turning back to them) . . . end.
I will drink. . . the blood will wash in me, over me and I will be cleansed, I will be worthy to free Acathla. (to Spike and Dru) Bear witness, as I ascend. (looking at the man) As I become.
Get away from me.
Who are you?
I want to know who you are.
You already do.
I don't understand you.
You're not a vampire.
What did you mean, I could go either way?
I just want to be left alone.
You don't know what I have to deal with. What I've done.
What do you want from me?
Where is it?
I want to help her. I want to. . . I want to become someone.  I want to help.
I want to learn from you.
But I don't want to dress like you.
Everything that I am, everything that I have done, has led me here.  This night. This act. (to the statue) You will be free.
The ritual. There must be something I missed. The incantations, the blood. . . Dammit! I don't know. . .
What we always do in a time of trouble. Turn to an old friend. We'll have our Armageddon, I swear.
Hello, lover.
I wasn't sure you'd come.
There's time enough. I wanted to say goodbye first. You are the one thing in this dimension I will miss.
(hurt) I didn't come here to fight!
Gosh, I was hoping we could get back together! What do you  think, do we have a shot?
All right, we'll fight.
Is it me, or is your heart not in this?
Maybe I'll just go home. Destroy the world. . . sulk. . .
You never learn, do you? Little miss ego. 'You and me.'  This wasn't about <u>you</u>. This was never about you.
And you fall for it <u>every single time</u>!
