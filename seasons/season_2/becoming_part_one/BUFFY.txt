Come on. Ooh, nice try.
Now that was just sloppy. If you're not even gonna try, then. . .
I want you to give Angel a message for me. Tell him  I'm done waiting. I'm taking the fight to him. You got that? Do you want me to write it down?
All right, I'll tell him myself.
You know, you don't have to patrol with me.
But no Angel.
I just want it over with.
We better get back. I haven't even started studying for finals.
Look on the bright side. It'll all be over soon.
Yeah, that's just exactly how it happened.
The theme is, Angel's too much of a coward to take me on face to face.
Can everybody stop asking me that? Yeah I'm ready. Also willing, also able. It's the one test I might actually pass.
I'm ready to rock. You're the best, Will. Thanks.
This is a cafeteria. I'm pretty sure.
Or I could go with the classroom theory. . .
Sums it up.
Maybe. . . I do have to patrol.
No, I don't expect him to. And that's when he usually does.
Waaahhh.
This doesn't make sense!
It's senseless.
Yay me. (as Willow looks at her work) Oh well. It doesn't matter. I mean, in the real world when am I ever  gonna need to use chemistry, math, history or the English language?
I'm a moron?
Wow. You really are a good teacher.
I got the pep.
Oh. Hold it.
Whoah. Deja vu.
--hey.
I think you dropped this.
This feels kind of morbid.
Does that make this less morbid or you really morbid?
Relax. I'm making with the funny. What does that say, "restoration"?
Willow.
The curse. This is it.
Well, she tried anyway. And it looks like it might have worked.
Will, I don't want you putting yourself in danger.
I care.
It's not that simple.
All right, stop it!
I don't know. . . What happened to Angel wasn't his fault. . .
Yeah, I'll do a couple of sweeps, then I'll stop by. (listens) Yeah, Xander was pretty much being a. . .  (mildly shocked) Willow. Where'd you learn that word? My god. You kiss your mother with that mouth? (Listens) I don't know. I don't know what I want.
Okay. I'll see you in a while.
Oh. Uh, to Willow's. To Study. Got two finals tomorrow.
Oh, we don't like boys. I mean, while we're studying. We like boys. Some boys. . .
You know, it's funny. I've just been kind of. . . religious. Lately.
Well, I'm learning. . . sort of searching.
Okay.
You know, polite people call before they jump out of the bushes and attack you.
(not angry) Would you like to test my face-punching? 'Cause I think you'll find it's improved.
Which begs the question and don't think I'm not glad to see you but why are you here? Wait. Let me guess. Your Watcher has informed you that a very dark power is about to rise in Sunnydale.
Great. Did he give you any idea of what this dark power is?
And we're sure this thing was the Tomb of Alfalfa?
So that would be the literal kind of sucking into Hell. Neat.
I'd bet folding money on it.
Willow. . . I think you should try to do the curse. Bring Angel back.
I'll fight him. If I have to, I'll kill him. But if I lose, or I don't find him in time. . . Willow might be our only hope.
I'll wing it. Of course, if we go to Hell by then I won't have to take them. (sudden fear) Or maybe I'll be taking them forever. . .
So, I'm like, "Dad, you want me to go to the dance in an outfit I've already worn? Why do you hate me?"
Oh my god! Where were you when I got over Tyler? He's of the past. Tyler would have to crawl on his hands and knees to get me to go to the dance with him. Which he's  actually supposed to do after practice, so I'm gonna wait.
Call me. Call me. Call me.
Yeah? Hi. What?
You're not from Macy's, are you? 'Cause I meant to pay for that lipstick. . .
I don't have a destiny. I'm destiny-free. Really.
Who?
Huh?
AAAAAAGHHHH!
Oh god oh god oh god --
Whoah! Wow.
Ooh, that's not the heart. . .
GAAAGHHH!
I'm sorry, Mom, I didn't know it was so late. Tyler and I were talking.
It's my fault.
Okay.
She said more would die. I have to go.
I need you here. Just in case. I'll be all right. As long as  Angel's fighting me he's not doing this end of the world ritual and that's good. And with any luck. . . Willow? What do you think?
We don't have time. If this is gonna work I need it to work now.
I can't risk him killing more people.
I'll run away.
I'd better go.
I will.
You named your stake.
Remind me to get you a stuffed animal. (Puts the stake in her jacket) Thanks.
After your immolation-o-gram? Come on, I had to show. But shouldn't you be destroying the world right about now? Pulling the sword out of Al Franken, or  whatever he's called?
(suppressing emotion) This is a beautiful moment we're having here. Can we just fight, please?
No?
(quietly) Come on, Willow.
I think Mister Pointy is gonna have something to say about that.
Come on. Let's finish it. You and me.
