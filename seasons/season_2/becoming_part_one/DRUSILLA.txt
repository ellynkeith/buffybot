Bless me, father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession.
Father?
Oh, father. . . I'm so afraid.
I had. . . I've been seeing again, father. Didn't try to, I swear! But yesterday the men were going to work in the mine and I had a terrible fright, my stomach all tied up and I saw a horrible crash,  men screaming in the dark. . .my mum said to keep my peace, it didn't mean nothing but this morning they had a cave in. Two men died.
(it pours out:) My mum says I'm cursed. My seeing things is an affront  to the Lord. That only He's supposed to see anything before  it happens. But I don't mean to, Father, I swear. I try to be pure  in His sight and I do my penance, I don't want to be an evil thing.
(mortified) A devil. . .
What can I do?
No. . . I want to be good. . . I want to be pure. . .
Father, I beg you. . . help me.
Yes, Father, thank you.
Yes?
I met an old man. I didn't like him. He got stuck in my teeth. (looks up)  And then the moon started whispering to me. All sorts of dreadful things.
Oh yes. . . something terrible.
At the museum. A tomb. With a surprise inside.
Is that what's been whispering to me?
Oooh, he fills my head. . . I can't hear anything else. . .
He will swallow the world.
Spike, sweetie, the fun's about to begin.
Don't be all gloomy.
My Spikey's getting cold feet. Don't you worry about the next world. You'll always have me. . .
Oh! The blood ritual! To cleanse Angel. Let's go and see.
This is so disappointing. What are we going to do?
Enough.
Look at me, Dearie. Be in my eyes. Be in me.
(to Kendra) Night night. (to the vamps) Let's get what we came for, dears.
