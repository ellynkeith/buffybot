Just wanted to test your reflexes.
I was on my way to your house. Saw you walking. Couldn't help myself.
That's about it.
(to Buffy) You think Angelus and the others are responsible for the theft of the tomb?
I can't believe you dated him. (off her look) I mean, he's got to be stopped.
(to Giles) You did? Good for you.
I tend to side with your friend Xander on this one. Angel should be eliminated.
We have.
Blessed by the knight who first slew the Demon. If all else fails, this might stop it. (less confidently) I think.
And I should go with you.
A Slayer never runs aw --  (off their looks) Good plan.
Here. In case the curse does not succeed. . . This is my lucky stake. I have killed many vampires with it. (in a low voice) I call it Mister Pointy.
(embarrassed) Yes.
Watch your back.
