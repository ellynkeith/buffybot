It's so unfair.
It's the uber-suck! Mom could have at least warned me!
A complete stranger in my house  for two weeks! I'm gonna be insane! A danger to myself and others within three days, I swear.
Have you ever done an exchange program?
Whatcha looking at?
I don't know. Guy-like.
I was just told 'guy.'
(looking off) What's he doing?
Maybe I should stop him before he gets in -
I wasn't gonna use violence. I  don't always use violence. Do I?
I might have used reason. Or my  feminine wiles.
His name is Ampata. He's showing up at the bus station tomorrow night.
So, can I go?
How come?
Just this once, can't I be the  Overlooked One?
(sarcastic) Oh, I can finish this one for you. 'Slaying entails certain sacrifices  blah blah blah-bity blah I'm so  stuffy give me a scone.'
(to Giles) So then, going to the dance, like a  normal person, is the best way to  keep that secret.
No, I'm just using them for good.
(smiling) Yay! I win!
I thought you were taking Willow.
And we enter dateville. Romance.  Flowers.
C'mon. All the years you've known Willow, you've never thought about her lips?
I don't remember him on the bus back from the field trip.
And attacked him…
Some day I'm going to live in a town where evil curses are just generally  ruled out without even saying.
Here. And it's broken.
Nope. Still there. Comfy as every.
Something did.
Willow? What is it?
He didn't seem overly chatty.
In the seal.
(suddenly) Ampata!
(starting out) I'm late. I told my mom I'd pick him up.
Ampata is there alone and I don't know how good his English is. He's- (realizing) --from South America! Maybe he could translate the seal.
Forty minutes late. Welcome to America.
(calling) Ampata? Ampata Duarte?
Ampata?
And this is the kitchen…
Oh yeah. Got your stove, your fridge… fully functional. We're very into it.
(looking into fridge) We've got milk and … older milk… Oh. Juice?
Have you been to America before.
Excuse me?
You said she was staying in the study.
Mom, you think too much.
I'm not a big secret sharer. I like my secrets. They're secret.
Fun. Yeah. (smiling) You know, next year I ought to sign up for one of those 'exchange mom' programs.
Sorry about the teenyness of the room.
What's it like, back home?
You'll feel right at home in Sunnydale.
How about friends?
I've been there. (brightening) But, hey. You'll meet lots of  people tomorrow.
One normal life, coming up.
Your first day of school. Nervous?
Don't worry. You're not going to have any problem making friends. As a  matter of fact, I know someone who's dying to meet you.
That was in no way awkward.
This is the only one we found.
By slicing them up?
Oh, right. And as Club President, I  have to do lots of stuff. Very  dull stuff. (re: Ampata) Willow, maybe you could-
Hah! Or possibly Hah… do you  think this matches?
(sympathetically) Ampata's only staying for two weeks.
I'm sorry.
Good for you.
My work?
So then, we just have to stop the  mummy. Which leaves the question: How do we a: find and b: stop the  mummy?
So, our bodyguard strikes again. Why  is he so into us? What's he want?
No, not-I mean, he…
Why would the Bodyguard have such  a jones for a broken piece of rock?
At the museum.
And he'll lead us to mummy dearest. (smiling) Hey, look at us. We came up with a  plan. A good plan.
No! Bad plan! I have other plans. Dance plans. (off his look; solemnly) Cancel plans.
Should be on the dresser.
They sent your stuff from the station.
I can do it.
I'm not going.
I've got work to do. There are some bad things happening out there. That guy with the knife is only one of them.
He seems very happy around you.
And that's good?
I'll help you look.
A princess? Cool.
--chosen.
It's fairly familiar.
Who knows?
Xander and Willow. I'll get it.
What culture are you?
New line-up. You and Willow are  taking Ampata, Giles and I are  hunting mummies. (then) Where's you and Willow?
Oh. On a date. Romance. Lips.
I can translate America Salivating  Boy-talk. He said you're beautiful.
You're welcome.
I will.  (then) And Xander? You look good.
Yeah. How about that?
Yep. Not at the dance. Not with my friends. Not with a life. (then) What are you doing here? I thought we were going to meet at the museum to find the bodyguard?
I don't get it. Why would the mummy kill his own bodyguard?
Not a bodyguard, then.
So Ampata translated wrong?
Well, wait… She was wiggy about  the seal from minute one.
(thinking) Her trunks.
How about this one? What kind of girl travels with a mummified corpse…
She did say she wanted to meet lots  of people.
So much for her normal life of fun  and dating and- (it hits her) --Xander.
I should've guessed. Remember? Ampata wanted us to hide the seal.
Waiting.
What? You mean that, if breaking  the seal freed her-
I'll stop Ampata. Before she gives Xander the kiss of death.
I will. Besides, I've got the element of surprise. Ampata still doesn't  know my secret identity.
Where's Xander?
We've to find them. Ampata is the mummy.
Where'd they go?
Are you all right?
Where's Ampata?
The seal. At the museum. Where  Giles is. She's gone to stop him. Come on!
We'll tell him on the way.
I know.
--You don't kiss and tell.
Oh, and you are?
We don't have to talk.
Ampata wasn't evil. At least not to  start with. And I do think she cared for you.
She was gypped. She was just a girl and she had her life taken from her. I remember when I heard the prophesy  that I was going to die. I wasn't exactly  obsessed with doing the right thing.
I had you to bring me back.
