Well, a lot of the parents are doing it this year. It's part of this whole cultural exchange magilla. The  exhibit, the dance…
I think the exchange student program is cool. (off their looks) I do. It's the beautiful melding of  two cultures.
My dad tried to sell me to some Armenians once, does that count?
By 'guy-like,' you mean a big,  beefy, guy-like girl, right?
Hold on a sec. This person living in  your house for two weeks is a man, with man parts? This is a terrible idea!
There's no melding. Okay? He can keep his parts to himself.
Rodney Munson. God's gift to the  bell curve.
Yeah, I'm irrational that way.
The important thing is, you believe that.
Typical museum trick. Promise human sacrifice, deliver old pots and pans.
No. I think the story ends with, 'And  she became a scary, discolored, shriveled mummy.'
So, Buffy, when's exchange-o boy making his appearance?
Ooh, Sunnydale bus depot. Classy.  What better way to say "Welcome  to Our Country" than with the  stench of urine.
Not with her. In the same house as  her. Am I the only one who's  objective enough to make that  distinction.?
So, we're dance-bound. I think I can  get mom's car, so I'm the wheel man.
Well, I'm gonna take Willow, but I'm  not gonna take Willow. In the sense of "take me." See with you, we're  three and everybody's safe. Without you, we're two.
Lips.
Buffy, I love Willow.
Willow. Hi. We were just talking  about happy things. Like all three of us going to the dance together. See? Happy. (then, worried) Not happy?
'Police are looking for Rodney Munson.' That's a phrase we'll get used to.
(picking up on it) Maybe he awakened the mummy-
For twenty-one hours?
Okay. I just saved us, right?
Maybe we should ask that crazy man with the big ol' knife.
Buffy, where are your priorities? In tracking down a mummifying murderer, or making time with some Latin lover,  whose stock in trade is the breakage of hearts?
Oh, sure. Fall for the old 'Let-me- translate-that-ancient-seal-for-you'  come one. You know how many times I've used that?
Do we have to speak Spanish when we see him? 'Cause I don't know how to  say anything much besides "Doritos" and "Chihuahua".
(quietly) Hay carumba. I also know how  to say that.
Do you want something to drink?
It's just one of those crazy mix ups, Will.
(as to a child) Where did… you go?
Your English is very bueno.  Muy good.
Well, that works out great, 'cause I talk much!
Okay, but what about me? I gotta think.
And a corresponding equal number of mocking alternatives, all aimed at me.
No hats with feathers, no ruffled Shirts and definitely no lederhosen. They make my calves look fat.
'Ar-chae-ol-o-gy.' Study of old stuff.
--stay with Ampata for the day?  I'd love to.
And this- (pulls something out) --is called snack food.
(unwrapping) It's a delicious, golden, spongy cake, filled with a delightful, white creamy substance of goodness. And here's how you eat it.
(with mouth full) That's why you bring two.
Good, huh? And the exciting part is, they have no ingredients that a human can pronounce. So they don't leave you with that heavy, food feeling in your  stomach.
Girls always tell me that. Right before they run away.
I like you like it. (thinks about that) Please don't learn from my English.
Come on!
Are you okay?
He said "give me the seal."
You're right, Ampata. And it's time we do. We're not in Archaeology  Club. We're in-
Ampata!
Ampata, listen to me. Nobody's going  to hurt you. I won't let them.
Wigged. I wanna convince her that our lives aren't just danger and peril here.
Yeah, that'll be fun. We can all…
But you were all psyched… your costume.
Thanks. You know what, Willow?  You're my best friend.
Okay. I have something to tell you. It's kind of a secret. And a little  bit scary.
Well, because you never know if the  girl is going to say yes, or if she's  going to laugh in your face, pull out your still-beating heart, and crush it into the ground with her heel.
Really?
That's great! Really?
That's great! (then) You're not a praying mantis, are you? (off her) Sorry. Someone else.
Where are you going?
Hey, I'll follow you anywhere you go - (sees WOMEN'S RESTROOM sign) -except for not in there. I'll wait outside.
I am not worried. Thanks to Xander.
I have come for the dance.
I am from the country of Leone. It's in Italy, pretending to be Montana. (then, re: her sweats) And what are you? From the country  of white trash?
She's not coming. With us.
Uh, ngh…bff…
(to Buffy) Cch… krl…
Be careful.
Yeah. You look… snug.
Do you want to, uh… would you like to, you know…
Okay. At least I can rule out,  'Something I said.'
You seen Ampata?
Next time you should probably  say, 'shrug.'
There you are. (going to her) Why did you run away?
Ha! Wh-You think you don't… (pointing back and forth) …that I would think… (then, laughing) Man, I love you!
Then talk to me. Tell me what's wrong.
I know why you can't tell me. It's  a secret, right?
(dazed) Ampata…
I think so. (touching his jaw) That was some kiss.
She said something about the seal.
What's going on?
No. Giles must've… researched wrong.
But I know Ampata. This can't be. She told me… she said…
If you're going to kiss anybody, it  should be me.
That's never gonna happen.
No!
I'm really the fun talking guy today, huh? Sorry.
I just… Present company excluded,  I have the worst taste in women. Of  anyone. In the world. Ever.
Yeah, but I think the whole sucking- the-life-out-of-people thing would  have been a strain on the relationship.
But you did. You gave up your life.
