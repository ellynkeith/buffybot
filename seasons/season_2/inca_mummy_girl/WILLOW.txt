I don't think it's that bad.
I have the best costume for the dance.
What about the beautiful melding of  two cultures?
You just don't like him 'cause of that time he beat you up every  day for five years.
I got it. The non-violent approach is probably better here.
(re: knife) That's probably not something you're supposed to be doing. You could get in trouble.
We still on for our Chem tutorial tomorrow?
There are 103.
We'll do a touch-up on math, too.
I hope this story ends with 'And she lived happily ever after.'
They could have at least wrapped  it in nice white bandages, like the  ones in the movies.
No. Yes. (recovering) Rodney's missing.
His parents said he never came home last night. The police are still looking for him.
I don't either. I hope he didn't get into trouble at the museum.
Right, and it rose from its tomb…
(hopeful) On the other hand, maybe Rodney  just went out for a smoke.
It's addictive, you know.
Does that mean the mummy's loose?
Giles. Were the Incans… very  advanced?
(small voice) Did they have orthodontists?
Rodney looked like he had been dead for five hundred years. How could  that be?
The way he bolted when he saw Rodney, I'd say he was as freaked as we were.
What if he left already.
So, Ampata… You're a girl.
And not a boy. 'Cause we thought  that a boy was coming, and here  you are in a girl way.
New York. That's exciting. What  was that like?
I worked really hard on my costume. It's pretty cool.
It's a celebration of cultures. There's  a lot of dress-up alternatives.
Bavarians are cool.
Why are you suddenly so worried about looking like an idiot? (a beat) That came out wrong.
Archaeology Club.
Boy. They really like each other.
Oh! Yes! I'm caring about mummies.
And then Xander will find someone else who's not me to obsess about. At least with you I knew he didn't  have a shot.
(brave face) Well, you know, I have a choice. I can spend my life waiting for Xander to go with every other girl in the world before he notices me, or I can just get  on with my life.
Well, I didn't choose yet…
Where's it say that?
Is she okay?
You should take her to the dance.
I mean just you.
I'll see you there.
(to herself) I know.
I guess I should have worn something sexy.
Thanks.
That's what I was going for. (tries to look around) Where's Buffy?
I shrugged.
Sigh.
He was looking for Ampata.
Oh. (smiles) Good. (stops smiling) Xander!
Backstage, I think.
He doesn't know.
(softly) Xander, he didn't.
