Hey. Are you guys going to the  Valentine's Dance at the Bronze?  I think it's gonna be fun.
Cool.
(to Buffy) What about you?
Bad break up?
What are you doing?
No, I'm not! That was my mom,  remember?
That's not even - I never - that's so  mean!
I didn't say blackmail.
What do you want?
A love spell?
That kind of thing is the hardest. I  mean, to make someone love you for  all eternity -
Then - I don't get it. If you don't want  to be with her forever - what's the  point?
I don't know, Xander. Intent has to  be pure with love spells.
I'll need something of hers. A personal  object.
"Diana, goddess of love and the hunt.  I pray to thee. Let my cries bind the  heart of Xander's beloved. May she  neither rest nor sleep…"
"until she submits to his will only.  Diana! Bring about this love and  bless it!"
Blow out the candle! Now!
Xander, can I talk to you for a minute?
Xander, I don't think the spell worked  out right.
Well, we could try again. I'm still  pretty new at this.
Well, we don't have to cast any spells -  we could just hang out.
Well, I really liked spending time  with you. You're so sweet… It's  funny how you can see a person  every day and -
Exactly!
So anyway, I thought it might be fun to -
Do you mind? We were talking.
Get away from him. He's mine.
He doesn't have to say. I know what  his heart wants.
"Goddess Hecate, work thy will…"
"Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!"
(glaring at Calendar) Why is she here?
Buffy can take care of herself. Let's  go someplace private.
Who made you Queen of the world?  I mean, you're <u>old</u> enough-
"Goddess Hecate, to you I pray-"
Why did you send Xander away?  He needs me.
He loves me. We look into each  other's souls.
You don't know what I'm going through!
"Diana! Hecate! I hereby license thee  to depart-"
"Goddess of creatures great and small -  I conjure thee to withdraw!"
