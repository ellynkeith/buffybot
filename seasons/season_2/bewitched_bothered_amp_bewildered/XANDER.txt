What do you think?
But do you think Cordelia will like it?
Okay, big yuks. When are you guys  gonna stop making fun of me for dating  Cordelia?
Parallel universe, maybe. Here the  only other person I'm interested in is  unavailable.
Besides, Cordy and I have really been  getting along. We don't fight as much.  Yesterday we just sat together, not even  speaking, you know, just enjoying  comfortable silence. (beat) Man, that was dull.
This is new territory for me. My  valentines are usually met with  heartfelt restraining orders.
I wish dating was like slaying - simple.  Direct. Stake to the heart, no muss no  fuss -
You're obviously not dating Cordelia.
Hah! This time I am ready for you.  No "F" for Xander today. This baby's  my ticket to a sweet "D minus".
You're welcome.
Did you guys see that?
In class. I thought I just saw Amy  working some magic on Miss Beakman.
Maybe I should talk to -
Hey.
I let Buffy dress me. (off her look) Well, not physically…
Okay. Clearly the fact that I please  you visually got us off on the wrong  foot here.
Let me finish. I've been thinking a lot  about us. The why and the wherefore.  And, you know - once, twice. A  kissy here. A kissy there. You can  chalk it up to hormones. But hormones  only take you so far. (then) Okay. Really far. And maybe that's  all we have here. Tawdry teen lust. (sincere) But maybe - not. Maybe something in  you sees something… special in me.  And visa versa. I mean, I think I do.  See something. So -
(stunned/re: necklace) Not really the reaction I was going for.
(anger growing) Yeah, okay - you know what's a good  day to break up with someone? <b>Any  day besides Valentine's Day</b>. Were  you just running low on dramatic irony?
Well you did.
Buffy. My bud. You would not  believe the kind of day -
Well, do you need help?
Amy! Good to see you! You're a witch.
I'm thinking it runs in the family. I  saw you working that mojo on Miss  Beakman. Maybe I should tell  someone about that.
Blackmail is such an ugly word.
Yeah, well I'm about to blackmail you  so I thought I'd bring it up.
What do I want? I want a little respect  around here. I want - for once - to  come out ahead. I want the hellmouth  working for me.
You and me, Amy… We're gonna cast  a little spell.
Just the basic. You know - can't eat,  can't sleep, can't breathe anything but  little old moi.
Whoa. Back up. Who said anything  about eternity? A man can only talk  self-tanning lotion for so long  before his head explodes.
The point is - I want her to want me.  Desperately. Then I can break up with  her and subject her to the same hell  she's putting me through.
Right. I intend revenge. Pure as the  driven snow. Now are you going to  play or do we need to chat some  more about invisible homework?
Don't flatter yourself. I'm not going  to make a big scene. I just want the  necklace back.
<u>Last night</u> it was a gift. Today it's scrap  metal. I figure I can melt it down -  sell it for fillings or something.
Come on. I'm not going to add to the  "Cordelia Chase Cast-Off Collection."
I can wait.
Great. Really. Good spell… Can I put  my shirt on now?
(all smiles) Morning, ladies. (seductively) Some weather we've been having.
Is this love? 'Cause, maybe on you it  doesn't look that different -
Sorry. My mistake.
I have a plan. We use me as bait.
No I mean chop me into little pieces  and stick me on hooks for fish to nibble  at cuz that would be more fun than my  life.
Not the popular theory…
Really?
Would lap dancing enter into this scenario  at all? 'Cause I find that very comforting.
Okay. You do know that I'm Xander,  right?
(enraptured) It's funny. And it's just getting  funnier.
(to Amy) Yeah. Okay. (to Buffy) Hold that thought. Tightly.
Yeah, we bombed. No biggie.
It's okay. You know what? It was  wrong to meddle with the forces of  darkness and I see that now. I think  we've all grown. I gotta go.
Sure… what?
(his expression drains) -- not really see them?
What?
I really have to leave right now.
Good job. High marks.
Yeah, Will, but we were in footie  pajamas.
Will, I think I know what you were  thinking, but this is all my fault, I cast  a spell and it sort of backfired -
A long, long time. Too long to do  anything that might change it now.
This is good. How close we are now?  I feel very comfortable with this amount  of closeness. In fact, I could even back  up a few paces and still be happy…  See?
(weakly hopeful) Baseman? Please tell me we're talking  softball.
That's… dry clean only.
It's not that I don't find you sexy-
Yes he is! And you should go to him.  'Cause he's me.
Willow, don't make me use force.
That's it. This has all gotta stop. It's  time for me to act like a man. And hide.
It's me. Throwing myself at your  mercy.
I made a mess, Giles. See, I found out  that Amy's into witchcraft? And I was  hurt, I guess, so I made her put the  love whammy on Cordy. But it backfired.  And now every woman in Sunnydale  wants to make me her cuddle-monkey.  Which may sound swell on paper but -
Oh no. I'm twice the fool it takes to  do something like this.
I get near Amy and all she wants to  talk is honeymoon plans.
Buff! Give me a heart attack-
Buffy. For the love of God, don't open  that rain coat.
Not that I don't want to… Sometimes  the remote, impossible possibility that  you might like me was all that sustained  me… (frustration mounting) But not now. Not like this. This isn't  real to you. You're only here because  of a spell. I mean, if I thought you had  one clue what it would mean to me…  But you don't, so I can't -
A game? I - no…
Buffy, please. Calm down-
What? I - I -
Uh oh.
Buffy!
Oh my God.
Buffy.
Do you think we could focus for one  minute? <u>You turned Buffy into a rat</u>!
Can you…? I'm not going anywhere  until you change her back!
Would you quit with the HECATE!?
No more talky from this one.
Good, Buffy. Just…
Kinda?! What was that for?
I didn't touch her. I swear -
Amy turned Buffy into a rat.
I think we-
-lost them…
Will. Come on. You don't want to  hurt me.
Now I really think we lost them.
There's Buffy's place. Let's get inside.  Then I'll explain.
She's… around.
I - uh -
Whatever.
Insane? It's impossible for you to  believe that other women find me  attractive?
That is <b>such a</b> -well okay yeah, good  point.
Good. The mob still hasn't found us.  We should be safer up here -
Cordy, get out of here!
Buffy?! How did you-
Really? It doesn't say - "spare him"  by any chance?
Don't you think we could start with  coffee? A movie maybe?
I… wouldn't hold my breath.
Give me another nail.
None of this would have happened if  you hadn't broken up with me. But  no, you're so desperate to be popular.
It would have worked fine! Except  your hide's so thick not even magic  can penetrate it!
Get behind me!
Well, your mom seemed to buy it.
Well, I'm back to being incredibly  unpopular.
Mostly. But… Willow. Won't even  talk to me.
How much groveling are we talking  here?
You remember, huh?
Need cheese?
I would never take advantage of you  like that. Okay, it was touch and go  for a minute there, but…
Tell that to Cordelia.
Sorry.
You're gonna be okay. Just keep  walking.
Sure they will. If it helps, when we're  around them you and I can fight a lot.
You can pretty much count on it.
