Hey… Wait up!
Excuse me? Where's the fire sale?
Why didn't you guys call me back last  night? We need to talk about our outfits  for the dance - I'm going to wear red  and black so you'd better switch -
Xander? What's he got to do with it?
Xander is just -
Your clothes. You look so nice.
Perfect. You just had to make this  harder, didn't you?
Xander -
(pained) Xander. Thank you. It's beautiful.  I want to break up.
I'm sorry. I really am. It's just - who  are we kidding? I mean, even if parts  of us do see specialness… We just don't  fit.
I know. I didn't mean to do it like this -
What? I thought it was a gift.
You're pathetic…
(stalling) It's in my locker.
Here. Thank God we broke up. Now  I don't have to pretend to like it.
<b>What</b>?
What do you want? You can't be sniffing  around for more jewelry to melt -  'cause all you ever gave me was that  Walmart-looking thing.
(shoves him back) What is up? Are you going, like,  stalker-boy on me?
Yeah. I'd say so.
What is his deal?
Ha. Very funny. What did I do now -  wear red and purple together?
Are you tripping? I thought you wanted  me to break up with him-
<b>What does it take to make you people happy?</b>
Okay. What now? You don't like my  locker combo?
Harmony, if you need to borrow my  Midol, just <b>ask</b>.
No! I, no….!
(genuinely scared) Dammit, Xander, what is going on?  Who died and made you Elvis?
Gross. I think not.
And keep your mom-aged mitts away  from my boyfriend… Former!
Why has everyone gone insane?
The only way you could get girls to  want you would be Witchcraft!
Déjà vu much? Here's another good  reason not to date you. People are  always trying to kill me when I'm  with you! So - what do we do now?  Wait for Buffy to come?
If we die in here I'm gonna kick your  ass! I mean it.
Me? I'm not the one who embraced  the black arts just to get girls to like  me. Well, congratulations, I guess it  worked.
(quieter) You mean, the spell was for me?
Oh god…
Boy! That was the best scavenger hunt  ever!
Cody? The one with the 350 SL?
That's so huge!
Harmony, shut up.
You know what you are, Harmony?  You're a sheep.
You're a sheep. Sweaters are  made from your wooly coat.
All you ever do is what everyone  else does, so you can say you did  it first. And here I am scrambling  for your approval, when I'm way  cooler than you are because I'm not  a sheep! I do what I want, I wear  what I want, and you know what?  I'll date whoever I want to date,  no matter how lame he is!
Oh, god, oh, god…
Oh god, what have I done? No one's  ever gonna speak to me again.
You promise?
