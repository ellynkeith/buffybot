Hey, Amy.
(to Amy) My boyfriend's in the band.
Only in this hemisphere.
I just hate to think of you solo on  Valentine's Day.
Well, her mom was a witch…
(to Xander) I think I'm a groupie.
Sorry. I wanted to surprise you.
Don't be so jumpy. I've been in your  bed before.
Xand. I've been thinking.
(cutting him off) How long have we been friends?
But friendships always change. People  grow apart. They grow <u>closer</u>.
I want you, Xander. To be my first-
Shhhh. We both know it's right.
Is it Oz? Don't worry about him. He's  sweet - but he's not you.
Force is okay…
I should have known I'd find you with  her.
Oh no? You have no idea what this  is like for me. I love you so much.  I'd rather see you dead than with that  bitch!
Get them!
All you had to do was love me.
