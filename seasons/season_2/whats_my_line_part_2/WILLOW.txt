Hey-
(enough already) Hi guys. What's going on?
Is that even possible? I mean, two slayers at the same time?
So there really are two of them?
Buffy would never do that! Oh - (turns to Buffy) except for - that sometimes you do that. (to Kendra) But only with Angel! (to Buffy) Right?
Really.
There's a slayer handbook?
Is there a T-shirt too? (off their looks) Cause, that would be cool . . .
Creepy.
Giles is enough of a fact geek for both of you.
Buffy. No one can replace you. You'll always be Giles' favorite.
Of course you will. You're his slayer. The real slayer.
You mean, letting Kendra take over?
But not forever, right?
Environmental design? That's landscaping, right?
Oh. That's Oz. He's just expressing computer nerd solidarity.
Hey . . .
Uh, I think I'm gonna finish high school first. What about you?
Then why'd they select you?
Well, don't you have some ambition?
Huh?
(to Buffy) He's, he's shot- (to OZ) Are you okay?
The paramedic said it was only a scrape, thank goodness-
Okay. (then) Huh?
What is it, Buffy?
Don't worry, Buffy, we'll save Angel.
It's the extra evil vibe from the hellmouth. Makes people pray harder.
No, thanks. How's your arm?
You can still play guitar okay?
You know, I never really thanked you-
Then forget about - that thing. Especially the part where I kind of - owe you my life-
Yeah. I see.
