What's the matter, Willy. Don't trust me?
Talk and I'll have your guts for garters.
Oops. Sorry - friend.
I'm thinking - maybe dinner and a movie. I don't want to rush into  anything. I've been hurt, you know.
Of what, pet?
I brought you something-
Your sire, my sweet.
The one and only. Now all we need is  the new moon tonight. Then he will die and you will be fully restored-
My black goddess. My ripe, wicked plum. It's been-
Alright then, you can play. But don't kill him. He mustn't die until the ritual.
That's it then. Off to the church.
I'll see him die soon enough. I've never been much for the pre-show.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well?
Keep your hole shut!
I said - shut up!
That's ENOUGH.
Right. Right . . . You almost got me.
Aren't you a "throw himself to the lions" sort of sap these days?
Well, the lions are on to you, baby. If I kill you now - you go quick and Dru hasn't got a chance. And if Dru dies, your little Rebecca of SunnyHell farm and all her mates are spared her coming out party-
Too bad, Angelus. Looks like you go the hard way - along with the rest of this miserable town.
Eligor, I name thee. Bringer of war, poisoners, pariahs, grand obscenity!
Eligor, wretched master of decay, bring your black medicine. Come restore your most impious, murderous child-
From the blood of the sire she is risen! From the blood of the sire shall she rise again!
Right then! Now we let them come to a simmering boil, then remove to a low flame-
Are you tripping? You bring her here - now?
In the ground, pinhead! I wanted  her dead-
You heard wrong, Willy.
Five minutes. Patrice?
Who the hell is that?
Rather be fighting you anyway.
Where are you going?
They tricked you.
Well, I'll only kill you just this once.
Sorry, dear, we gotta go. Hope that was enough . . .
