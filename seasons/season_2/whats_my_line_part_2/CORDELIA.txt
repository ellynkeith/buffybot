Do you have this in raisin? I know you wouldn't think so - but I'm both a winter and a summer-
You - you said that already. Do you have anything in the berry family?
They aren't home. (then) Nothing personal - but maybe you should look into selling dictionaries-
He's a... salesman. But he was just leaving. (to Worm Guy) Right?
Okay. Bye bye. Thanks.
I - I don't - do worms -
Because you're just sitting there. You should be thinking up a plan.
How will she even know where to  find us?
What if she doesn't? I'm supposed to  just waste away down here with you? No thank you.
Checking to see if he's gone-
Oh - Right. You think we should just slack here and hope that somebody else decides to be a hero. Sorry, forgot I was stranded with a loser-
He looked normal -!
You know what? I'm going. I'd rather be worm food than look at  your pathetic face-
I bet you wouldn't. I bet you'd just let a girl go off to her doom all by herself-
I can't believe I'm stuck here spending what are probably my last moments on earth with you!
You're gonna what? Coward!
I hate you!
He's gone.
Help! Help me!
(to Kendra) Hi. Nice to meet you.
I know what it means, dork head-
Arrrgggghhhh!
Die! Die! Die!
Right. Okay. (then) Why shouldn't we run?
You're a pervert?
As if! You've probably been planning this for months-
Fine. Whatever. The point is, don't ever try it again-
If you dare breathe a word of this-
Then it's erased?
Good.
