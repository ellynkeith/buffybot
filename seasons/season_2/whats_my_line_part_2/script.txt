BUFFY: Let's start again. You're the who?
KENDRA: I'm the slayer.
BUFFY: Nice cover story. Here's a tip - try it on someone who's not the real slayer.
KENDRA: You can't stop me. Even if you kill me, another slayer will be sent to take my place.
BUFFY: Could you stop with the slayer thing? I'm the damn slayer!
KENDRA: Nonsense. There is but one - and I am she.
BUFFY: Okay . . . Scenario: I back off. You promise not to go all wiggy until we go to my watcher and figure out what this is all about.
KENDRA: Wiggy?
BUFFY: You know - no kicko, no fighto?
KENDRA: I accept your scenario.
KENDRA: Your English is very odd, you know.
BUFFY: Yeah - it's something about being woken by an axe. Makes me talk all crazy. (then) So you were sent here?
KENDRA: Yes, by my Watcher.
BUFFY: To do what, exactly?
KENDRA: To do my duty. I am here to kill vampires.
GILES: (to Kendra) Your watcher is Sam Zabuto, you say?
KENDRA: Yes, sir.
GILES: We've never met - but he is very well respected.
BUFFY: What? So he's a real guy? As in, non-fictional?
GILES: And what are you called?
KENDRA: I am the vampire slayer.
BUFFY: (irked) We got that part. He means your name.
SLAYER: Oh. They call me Kendra, only. I have no last name, sir.
BUFFY: Can you say - stuck in the 80's?
GILES: Buffy - please. There has obviously been some kind of misunderstanding here.
WILLOW: Hey-
KENDRA: Identify yourself!
BUFFY: Back off, Pink Ranger. This is my friend-
KENDRA: Friend?
BUFFY: You know. Person you hang with? Amigo?
KENDRA: I - I don't understand.
BUFFY: You try. I'm tapped.
GILES: Kendra. There are a few people, civilians if you will, who know Buffy's identity. Willow is one of them. And they also spend time together. Socially.
KENDRA: And you allow this, sir?
GILES: Well, you see . . .
KENDRA: But, the slayer must work in secret. For security-
GILES: Of course. With Buffy, however, it's . . . Some flexibility is required-
KENDRA: Why?
WILLOW: (enough already) Hi guys. What's going on?
BUFFY: There's been a big mix-up.
GILES: It seems, that somehow, another slayer has been sent to Sunnydale.
WILLOW: Is that even possible? I mean, two slayers at the same time?
GILES: Not that I know of. The new slayer is only called after the previous slayer has died- (then/realizing) Good lord . . . You were dead, Buffy.
BUFFY: (defensive) I was only gone for a minute.
GILES: Clearly, it doesn't matter how long you were gone. You were physically dead, causing the activation of the next slayer.
KENDRA: She . . . died?
BUFFY: Just a little.
GILES: Yes, she drowned. But she was revived.
WILLOW: So there really are two of them?
GILES: It would appear so. Yes.
GILES: We have no precedent for this. I'm quite flummoxed.
BUFFY: What's the flum? It's a mistake. She isn't supposed to be here. She goes home. (to Kendra) No offense. But, I'm not dead and it's a teeny bit creepy having you around.
KENDRA: I cannot simply leave. I was sent here for a reason. Mr. Zabuto said all the signs indicate that a very dark power is about to rise in  Sunnydale.
GILES: He's quite right. I'll need to contact him.
BUFFY: So what was your plan for fighting this dark power? Just sort of attack people till you found a bad one?
KENDRA: Of course not.
BUFFY: Then why the hell did you jump me?
KENDRA: (sheepish) I thought you were a vampire.
BUFFY: Oooh, a swing and a miss for the rookie.
KENDRA: I had good reason to think you were. Did I not see you kissing a vampire?
WILLOW: Buffy would never do that! Oh - (turns to Buffy) except for - that sometimes you do that. (to Kendra) But only with Angel! (to Buffy) Right?
BUFFY: Yes right. (to Kendra) You saw me with Angel. He's a vampire but he's good.
KENDRA: Angel? You mean Angelus? I've read of him. He is a monster.
GILES: No, no, he's good now.
WILLOW: Really.
BUFFY: He had a gypsy curse.
KENDRA: Oh. (beat) He had a what?
BUFFY: Just trust me. Angel's on the home team now. Wouldn't hurt a fly.
KENDRA: I cannot believe you. He looked to me like just another animal when I -
BUFFY: When you what? What did you do  to him?
KENDRA: I . . .
BUFFY: What did you do?
WILLY: Here you go, friend. A little singed around the edges, maybe, but he'll be good as new in a day or so.
WILLY: Hey now. We had a deal.
SPIKE: What's the matter, Willy. Don't trust me?
WILLY: Like a brother.
SPIKE: Talk and I'll have your guts for garters.
WILLY: Wild horses couldn't drag it.
SPIKE: Oops. Sorry - friend.
WILLY: What're you gonna do with him, anyway?
SPIKE: I'm thinking - maybe dinner and a movie. I don't want to rush into  anything. I've been hurt, you know.
CORDELIA: Do you have this in raisin? I know you wouldn't think so - but I'm both a winter and a summer-
GUY: $9.99, tax included.
CORDELIA: You - you said that already. Do you have anything in the berry family?
GUY: Are there more ladies in the house?
CORDELIA: They aren't home. (then) Nothing personal - but maybe you should look into selling dictionaries-
XANDER: Hey. What's up?
CORDELIA: He's a... salesman. But he was just leaving. (to Worm Guy) Right?
CORDELIA: Okay. Bye bye. Thanks.
XANDER: Come on, Mary Kay. Time to -
XANDER: Time to . . .
XANDER: Run.
XANDER: Find something to block the crack under the door!
CORDELIA: I - I don't - do worms -
XANDER: Cover me.
XANDER: You know - just when you think you've seen it all. Along comes a worm guy.
BUFFY: Angel -?
KENDRA: No ashes.
BUFFY: What?
KENDRA: When a vampire combusts, he  leaves ashes.
BUFFY: Yeah, I know the drill.
KENDRA: So I did not kill him.
BUFFY: And I don't have to kill you.
WILLY: Whoah, there's a lot of tension in  this room.
BUFFY: Doesn't anyone just say "hello" where you come from?
KENDRA: This one is dirty. I can feel it.
BUFFY: That's nice for you, percepto girl. But we're not going to get anything out of him if he's oh, say, unconscious.
BUFFY: Where is Angel?
WILLY: My bud, Angel? You think I'd let him fry? I saved him in the nick. He was about five minutes away from being a crispy critter.
BUFFY: Where did he go? Home?
WILLY: Uh, he said he was gonna stay underground. You know, recuperate.
BUFFY: Are you telling me the truth?
WILLY: I swear! I swear on my mother's grave should something fatal happen to her god forbid.
KENDRA: Then he is all right. We can return to your Watcher for our orders.
BUFFY: Orders? I don't take orders. I do things my way.
KENDRA: No wonder you died.
BUFFY: Let's go.
WILLY: I have to ask if either of you girls has considered modeling. I got a friend with a camera, strictly high class nude work - art photographs, but naked.
WILLY: You don't have to answer right away . . .
DRUSILLA: Ah. I was dreaming-
SPIKE: Of what, pet?
DRUSILLA: Beautiful. We were in Paris. You had a branding iron . . .
SPIKE: I brought you something-
DRUSILLA: And there were worms in my baguette . . .
SPIKE: Your sire, my sweet.
DRUSILLA: Angel?
SPIKE: The one and only. Now all we need is  the new moon tonight. Then he will die and you will be fully restored-
SPIKE: My black goddess. My ripe, wicked plum. It's been-
DRUSILLA: Forever.
DRUSILLA: Let me have him. Until the moon.
SPIKE: Alright then, you can play. But don't kill him. He mustn't die until the ritual.
DRUSILLA: Bring him to me.
DRUSILLA: You've been a very bad daddy.
GILES: Kendra, I've conferred with your Watcher, Mr. Zabuto. He and I agree that until this matter with Spike and Drusilla is resolved, you two should work together.
BUFFY: Oh, that'll be a treat.
KENDRA: So you believe that Spike is attempting  to revive this Drusilla to health?
GILES: Yes. That would be the dark power your Watcher referred to. Drusilla is not just evil. She's also quite mad. Restored to her full health there is absolutely no telling what she might do.
KENDRA: Then we will stop Spike.
BUFFY: Good plan! Let's go! Charge!
GILES: Buffy-
BUFFY: (to Kendra) It's a little more complicated than that, okay, John Wayne?
GILES: Yes, I'm afraid it is. Spike has called out the Order of Taraka to keep Buffy out of the way.
KENDRA: The assassins? I read of them in the writings of Dramius.
GILES: Really? Which volume?
KENDRA: I believe it was six, sir.
BUFFY: (to Kendra) How do you know that stuff?
KENDRA: From my studies.
BUFFY: So - you have a lot of free time.
KENDRA: I study because it is required. The slayer handbook insists on it.
WILLOW: There's a slayer handbook?
BUFFY: Handbook? What handbook? How  come I didn't get a handbook?
WILLOW: Is there a T-shirt too? (off their looks) Cause, that would be cool . . .
GILES: After meeting you, Buffy, I was quite sure the handbook would be of no use in your case.
BUFFY: What do you mean - "it would be of no  use in my case?" What's wrong with my case?
GILES: Kendra - perhaps you could show me the bit in Dramius six about the Order of Taraka. I must admit, I could never get through that book.
KENDRA: Yes, it was difficult. All those footnotes!
BUFFY: (sotto) Hello and welcome to the planet  pocket protector.
GILES: Oh, Buffy. Principal Snyder came snooping around for you.
BUFFY: Eeee, the career fair.
GILES: You'd best make an appearance, I think.
BUFFY: Right.
KENDRA: Buffy's a student here?
GILES: Yes.
KENDRA: Right. Of course. I'd imagine she's a cheerleader, too.
GILES: Actually, she gave up cheerleading. It's a funny story, really . . .
GILES: Let's go find that book, shall we?
BUFFY: Get a load of the She-Giles.
WILLOW: Creepy.
BUFFY: I bet Giles wishes I were more of a  fact geek.
WILLOW: Giles is enough of a fact geek for both of you.
BUFFY: But you saw how he and Kendra were vibing. "Volume six - ha, ha, ha!"
WILLOW: Buffy. No one can replace you. You'll always be Giles' favorite.
BUFFY: I wonder . . .
WILLOW: Of course you will. You're his slayer. The real slayer.
BUFFY: No - I mean, I wonder if it would be so bad. Being replaced.
WILLOW: You mean, letting Kendra take over?
BUFFY: Maybe. It would be wild if, after this thing with Spike and the assassins is over, I could say - "Kendra, you slay. I'm going to Disneyland . . ."
WILLOW: But not forever, right?
BUFFY: No, Disneyland would get boring after a few months. But I could do . . . other stuff. Any stuff. Career day stuff. Who knows, Willow, I might even be able to have, like, a normal life . . .
XANDER: Think you could sit down or change your pattern or something? You're  making me queasy.
CORDELIA: Because you're just sitting there. You should be thinking up a plan.
XANDER: I do have a plan. We wait. Buffy saves us.
CORDELIA: How will she even know where to  find us?
XANDER: Cordelia. This is Buffy's house. Odds are - she'll find us.
CORDELIA: What if she doesn't? I'm supposed to  just waste away down here with you? No thank you.
XANDER: What are you doing?
CORDELIA: Checking to see if he's gone-
XANDER: That's brilliant. What if he isn't?
CORDELIA: Oh - Right. You think we should just slack here and hope that somebody else decides to be a hero. Sorry, forgot I was stranded with a loser-
XANDER: And yet, I never forgot that I was stuck with the numb-brain who let  Mr. Mutant into the house in the  first place-
CORDELIA: He looked normal -!
XANDER: What - he was supposed to have an arrow and the word ASSASSIN over  his head? All it took was the prospect of a free makeover and you licked his hand like a big, dumb DOG!
CORDELIA: You know what? I'm going. I'd rather be worm food than look at  your pathetic face-
XANDER: Then go. I won't stop you-
CORDELIA: I bet you wouldn't. I bet you'd just let a girl go off to her doom all by herself-
XANDER: Not just any girl. You're special-
CORDELIA: I can't believe I'm stuck here spending what are probably my last moments on earth with you!
XANDER: I hope these are my last moments! Three more seconds of you and I'm gonna-
CORDELIA: You're gonna what? Coward!
XANDER: Moron!
CORDELIA: I hate you!
XANDER: I hate you!
XANDER: We so need to get out of here.
CORDELIA: He's gone.
CORDELIA: Help! Help me!
BUFFY: Okay, my tests say I should be looking into law enforcement - duh - and environmental design . . .
WILLOW: Environmental design? That's landscaping, right?
BUFFY: (shrugs) I checked the shrub box. Landscaping was yesterday - so law it is.
BUFFY: Don't look now, Will, but that guy over there is totally checking you out.
WILLOW: Oh. That's Oz. He's just expressing computer nerd solidarity.
BUFFY: Really? Then why is he on his  way over?
OZ: Hi.
BUFFY: (to Willow) Told you.
OZ: Hey.
WILLOW: Hey . . .
OZ: Did you decide? Are you gonna become a corporate computer suit guy?
WILLOW: Uh, I think I'm gonna finish high school first. What about you?
OZ: I'm not really a computer person. Or a work of any kind person.
WILLOW: Then why'd they select you?
OZ: I sort of test well. Which is cool, except then it leads to jobs.
WILLOW: Well, don't you have some ambition?
OZ: Oh, yeah. E flat, diminished 9th.
WILLOW: Huh?
OZ: The E flat's doable, but it's that diminished 9th . . . that's a man's chord. You could lose a finger.
LADY: Listen up and answer when I call  your name!-
LADY: Buffy Summers!
BUFFY: Here.
BUFFY: Get down!
OZ: Look out!
BUFFY: Don't!
WILLOW: (to Buffy) He's, he's shot- (to OZ) Are you okay?
OZ: I'm shot. Wow. It's very . . . odd. And painful.
KENDRA: She's gone.
KID: Was - was that a demonstration?
BUFFY: (to Giles) She was definitely one of the Taraka gang, Giles. And way gun happy.
GILES: (to Willow) And this Oz, he's alright?
WILLOW: The paramedic said it was only a scrape, thank goodness-
BUFFY: Down girl-
XANDER: Who sponsored career day today - The British Soccer Fan Association?
GILES: We had a rather violent visit from one of the Order of Taraka-
XANDER: You want to talk Order of Taraka? We met the king freak of the Order of-
GILES: Forgive me. Xander, Cordelia - this  is Kendra. It's very complicated, but she is also a slayer-
CORDELIA: (to Kendra) Hi. Nice to meet you.
XANDER: (to Buffy) A slayer? I knew this "I'm the only one, I'm the only one" thing was just an attention getter.
BUFFY: Just say hello, Xander.
XANDER: Welcome. So you're a slayer, huh? I like that in a woman.
KENDRA: I - I, hope . . . I thank you. I mean, sir . . . I will be of service.
XANDER: Good. Great. It's good to be a giver.
GILES: This assassin you encountered, Xander. What did he look like?
XANDER: Like that.
BUFFY: You and bug people, Xander. What's up with that?
XANDER: But this dude was different than the preying mantis lady. He was a man of bugs. Not a man who was a bug.
WILLOW: Okay. (then) Huh?
GILES: The important thing is - everybody's okay. Still, it is quite apparent that we are under serious attack-
BUFFY: Yeah. These Taraka guys are Uberbad. If Kendra hadn't been there today I would have been toast.
GILES: I fear the worst is yet to come. I've discovered the remaining keys to Drusilla's cure. The ritual requires her sire and must take place in a church on the night of the new moon-
KENDRA: The new moon? But that is tonight.
GILES: Exactly. I'm sure the assassins are here to kill Buffy before she can put a stop to things-
BUFFY: They need Drusilla's sire? You mean the vamp that made her?
WILLOW: What is it, Buffy?
BUFFY: (painfully) It's Angel. He's Drusilla's sire.
XANDER: Man! That guy got some major neck  in his day-
BUFFY: (to Giles) This thingy. This ritual. Will it kill him?
GILES: I'm afraid so.
BUFFY: We have to do something. We have to find the church where this ritual  takes place-
GILES: Agreed. And we must work quickly. There are only five hours to sundown.
WILLOW: Don't worry, Buffy, we'll save Angel.
KENDRA: Angel? Our priority must be to stop Drusilla.
XANDER: (bridling) Angel's our friend. Except I don't like him.
BUFFY: Look, you've got your priorities and I've got mine. Right now, they mesh. You gonna work with me or are you gonna get out of my way?
KENDRA: (a beat) I am with you.
BUFFY: Good. Cause I've had it. Spike is going down. You can attack me, you can send assassins after me . . . that's  just fine. But nobody messes with my boyfriend.
DRUSILLA: My mother ate lemons. Raw.
DRUSILLA: She said she loved the way they made  her mouth tingle-
DRUSILLA: Little Anne - her favorite was custard . . . Brandied pears . . .
ANGEL: Dru-
DRUSILLA: (stern) Shhhhhh. (then) And pomegranates. They used to  make her face and fingers all red-
DRUSILLA: Remember little fingers? Little hands? (beat) Do you?
ANGEL: If I could- I-
DRUSILLA: (snapping) Bite your tongue . . . They used to eat. Cake. And eggs. And honey. (sweet as can be) Until you came and ripped their throats out-
DRUSILLA: You remember?
ANGEL: Yes.
DRUSILLA: You remember that kind of hungry?
ANGEL: Yes . . .
DRUSILLA: You used to feed me.
DRUSILLA: You think you don't have it in you now. But you do. I can feel it.
DRUSILLA: I can almost taste it.
GILES: There are forty three churches in Sunnydale? That seems a bit excessive.
WILLOW: It's the extra evil vibe from the hellmouth. Makes people pray harder.
GILES: Check and see if any of them are closed or abandoned.
XANDER: We got demons. We got monsters.  But no bug dude or Police Lady.
GILES: You should have better luck with this. There's a section devoted entirely to the Order of Taraka.
KENDRA: And those two, they also know you  are the Slayer.
BUFFY: Yup.
KENDRA: Did anyone explain to you what "secret identity" means?
BUFFY: Nope. Must be in the handbook. Right after the chapter on personality removal.
BUFFY: Careful with that thing.
KENDRA: Please. I am an expert in all weapons-
BUFFY: Yeah, it's okay. Kendra killed the bad lamp.
KENDRA: Sorry. This trigger mechanism is different. (conciliatory) Perhaps when this is over you can show me how to work it.
BUFFY: When this is over, I'm thinking pineapple pizza and teen video fest - possibly something from the Ringwald oeuvre.
KENDRA: I'm not allowed to watch television. My Watcher says it promotes intellectual laziness.
BUFFY: And he says it like it's a bad thing?
XANDER: Here we go. I am the Bug Man, coo coo coo chu.
XANDER: (finds something) Okay. Okay. He can only be killed when he's in his disassembled state.
XANDER: Disassembled. That means when he's broken down into all his buggy parts-
CORDELIA: I know what it means, dork head-
XANDER: Dork head? You slash me with your words.
CORDELIA: Arrrgggghhhh!
KENDRA: Your life is very different than mine.
BUFFY: You mean the part where I occasionally have one? Yeah, I  guess it is.
KENDRA: The things you do and have, I was taught distract from my calling. Friends. School. Even family.
BUFFY: What do you mean - even family?
KENDRA: My parents - they sent me to my watcher when I was very young.
BUFFY: How young?
KENDRA: I don't remember them, actually. I've seen pictures . . . But that's how seriously the calling is taken by my people. My mother and father gave me to my watcher because they believed that they were doing the right thing for me - and for the world. You see?
BUFFY: Oh. I'm-
KENDRA: Please. I don't feel sorry for myself.  Why should you?
BUFFY: It just sounds very lonely.
KENDRA: Emotions are weakness, Buffy. You shouldn't entertain them.
BUFFY: What? Kendra - my emotions give me power. They're total assets.
KENDRA: Maybe. For you. But I prefer to keep an even mind.
BUFFY: Huh. I guess that explains it.
KENDRA: Explains what?
BUFFY: When we were fighting. You're amazing. Your technique. It's flawless. Better than mine-
KENDRA: I know.
BUFFY: (bristles) Still - I would have kicked your butt in the end. And you know why?  No imagination.
KENDRA: Really? You think so?
BUFFY: Yep. You're good. But power alone isn't enough. A great fighter goes  with the flow. She knows how to improvise. Don't get me wrong, I mean, you have potential-
KENDRA: Potential . . .
KENDRA: I could wipe the floor with you  right now.
BUFFY: That would be anger you're feeling.
KENDRA: (thrown off) What?
BUFFY: You feel it, right? How the anger gives you fire? A slayer needs that.
XANDER: Scuze me, ladies. (to Kendra) Nice knife.
BUFFY: I'm guessing dating isn't big with your Watcher either.
KENDRA: I am not permitted to speak with boys.
BUFFY: Unless you're pummeling them, right? (sudden thought) Wait a minute.
KENDRA: What?
BUFFY: That guy. The sleazoid you nearly  decked in the bar.
KENDRA: You think he might help us?
BUFFY: I think we might make him.
DRUSILLA: Say uncle?
DRUSILLA: Oh. That's right - you killed my uncle.
SPIKE: That's it then. Off to the church.
DRUSILLA: It makes pretty colors.
SPIKE: I'll see him die soon enough. I've never been much for the pre-show.
ANGEL: Too bad. That's what Drusilla likes best, as I recall.
SPIKE: What's that supposed to mean?
ANGEL: Ask her. She knows what I mean.
SPIKE: Well?
DRUSILLA: Shhhhhhhhh. Bad dog.
ANGEL: You should let me talk, Dru. Sounds like your boy could use some pointers. (to Spike) She likes to be teased-
SPIKE: Keep your hole shut!
ANGEL: Take care of her, Spike. The way she touched me just now . . . I can tell when she's not satisfied-
SPIKE: I said - shut up!
ANGEL: Or maybe you two just don't have the fire that we did-
SPIKE: That's ENOUGH.
DRUSILLA: Spike - NO!
SPIKE: Right. Right . . . You almost got me.
SPIKE: Aren't you a "throw himself to the lions" sort of sap these days?
SPIKE: Well, the lions are on to you, baby. If I kill you now - you go quick and Dru hasn't got a chance. And if Dru dies, your little Rebecca of SunnyHell farm and all her mates are spared her coming out party-
DRUSILLA: Spike. The moon is rising. It's time.
SPIKE: Too bad, Angelus. Looks like you go the hard way - along with the rest of this miserable town.
WILLY: Honest! I don't know where Angel is!
BUFFY: How about this ritual tonight? What have you heard?
WILLY: Nothing. It's all hush hush-
KENDRA: (impatient) Just hit him, Buffy.
BUFFY: She - likes to hit.
WILLY: You know, maybe I did hear something about this ritual. Yeah . . . It's coming back to me . . . But I'd - I'd have to take you there-
BUFFY: Let's go.
KENDRA: First, we must return to the watcher.
BUFFY: Excuse me? While we run to Giles, the whole thing could go down-
KENDRA: But, it is procedure-
BUFFY: It's brainless, you mean! If we don't go now - Angel could be history.
KENDRA: Is that all you're worried about? Your boyfriend?
BUFFY: It's not all. But it's enough.
KENDRA: It's as I feared. He clouds your judgment.  We can't stop this ritual alone-
BUFFY: He'll die-
KENDRA: He's a vampire. He should die! Why am I the only person who see it?
BUFFY: I'm going. With you or without you.
KENDRA: You're crazy. You'll be killed.
BUFFY: Then I guess this is goodbye.
WILLY: Here you go. Don't ever say your friend  Willy don't come through in a pinch-
WILLY: Here you go. Don't ever say your friend Willy don't come through in a pinch-
SPIKE: Eligor, I name thee. Bringer of war, poisoners, pariahs, grand obscenity!
SPIKE: Eligor, wretched master of decay, bring your black medicine. Come restore your most impious, murderous child-
SPIKE: From the blood of the sire she is risen! From the blood of the sire shall she rise again!
SPIKE: Right then! Now we let them come to a simmering boil, then remove to a low flame-
WILLY: It's pay day, pal. I got your slayer.
SPIKE: Are you tripping? You bring her here - now?
WILLY: You said you wanted her-
SPIKE: In the ground, pinhead! I wanted  her dead-
WILLY: (getting nervous) Now - now that's not what I heard. Word was, there was a bounty on her, dead or alive-
SPIKE: You heard wrong, Willy.
BUFFY: (to herself) Angel . . .
SPIKES: Yeah, it bugs me too, seeing 'em like that. Another five minutes and Angel'll be dead though, so I forebear. But don't feel too bad for Angel. He's got something you don't have.
BUFFY: What?
SPIKE: Five minutes. Patrice?
SPIKE: Who the hell is that?
BUFFY: It's your lucky day, Spike.
KENDRA: Two slayers.
BUFFY: No waiting.
XANDER: Hey larva boy!
XANDER: That's right. I'm talking to you - the big cootie.
XANDER: Welcome, my pretties. Mwa haa haa!
BUFFY: Switch!
SPIKE: Rather be fighting you anyway.
BUFFY: Mutual.
CORDELIA: Die! Die! Die!
XANDER: I think he did, Cordy . . .
SPIKE: Where are you going?
WILLY: There's a way in which this isn't  my fault.
SPIKE: They tricked you.
WILLY: (outraged) They were duplicitous!
SPIKE: Well, I'll only kill you just this once.
KENDRA: That's my favorite shirt. (thinks) That's my only shirt!
SPIKE: Sorry, dear, we gotta go. Hope that was enough . . .
BUFFY: I'm good . . .
KENDRA: She's good . . .
BUFFY: It's gonna be okay . . .
ANGEL: Buffy?
KENDRA: Let's get him out.
OZ: Oh. Hey. Animal cracker?
WILLOW: No, thanks. How's your arm?
OZ: Suddenly painless.
WILLOW: You can still play guitar okay?
OZ: Not well, but not worse.
WILLOW: You know, I never really thanked you-
OZ: Please, don't. I don't do thanks. I get all red and I have to bail. It's not pretty.
WILLOW: Then forget about - that thing. Especially the part where I kind of - owe you my life-
OZ: Look. Monkey. And he has a little hat. And pants.
WILLOW: Yeah. I see.
OZ: The monkey is the only cookie  animal that gets to wear clothes, you  know that? (then/casual) You have the sweetest smile I've ever seen.
OZ: So I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sort of ripped? Like, is the hippo going - man, where are my pants? . . . I have my hippo dignity . . .
XANDER: We need to talk.
XANDER: Okay. Here's the deal. There is no reason for us to run every time we see each other in the halls.
CORDELIA: Right. Okay. (then) Why shouldn't we run?
XANDER: What happened. There is a total explanation for it-
CORDELIA: You're a pervert?
XANDER: Me? I seem to recall that I was the jumpee, my friend-
CORDELIA: As if! You've probably been planning this for months-
XANDER: (incredulous) Right. I hired a Latvian Bug Man to kill Buffy so I could kiss you. I hate to burst your bubble, but you don't inspire me to spring for dinner at Bucky's Fondue Hut.
CORDELIA: Fine. Whatever. The point is, don't ever try it again-
XANDER: I didn't try it! Forget the bugs. Just the memory of your lips on mine makes my blood run cold-
CORDELIA: If you dare breathe a word of this-
XANDER: Like I want anyone to know!
CORDELIA: Then it's erased?
XANDER: Never happened.
CORDELIA: Good.
XANDER: Good!
KENDRA: Thank you for the shirt. It is very generous of you.
BUFFY: Oh, hey, it looks better on -- well, me, but don't worry.
BUFFY: Now, when you get to the airport --
KENDRA: I get on the plane with my ticket. And sit in a seat. Not the cargo hold.
BUFFY: Very good.
KENDRA: That is not traveling undercover.
BUFFY: Exactly. Relax. You earned it. You sit. You eat the peanuts. You watch the movie, unless it's about a dog or Chevy Chase.
KENDRA: I'll remember.
BUFFY: Thank you. For helping me save Angel.
KENDRA: I am not telling my Watcher about that. It is too strange that a slayer  loves a vampire.
BUFFY: Tell me about it.
KENDRA: Still, he is pretty cute.
BUFFY: Well, then, maybe they won't fire me for dating him.
KENDRA: You always do that.
BUFFY: Do what?
KENDRA: You talk about slaying like it's a job.  It's not. It's who you are.
BUFFY: You get that from the handbook?
KENDRA: From you.
BUFFY: I guess I can't fight it. I'm a freak.
KENDRA: But not the only freak.
BUFFY: Not anymore.
KENDRA: I don't hug.
BUFFY: No. Good. Hate hugs.
DRUSILLA: Don't worry, dear heart. I'll see that you get strong again . . .
DRUSILLA: Like me.
