Hey. What's up?
Come on, Mary Kay. Time to -
Time to . . .
Run.
Find something to block the crack under the door!
Cover me.
You know - just when you think you've seen it all. Along comes a worm guy.
Think you could sit down or change your pattern or something? You're  making me queasy.
I do have a plan. We wait. Buffy saves us.
Cordelia. This is Buffy's house. Odds are - she'll find us.
What are you doing?
That's brilliant. What if he isn't?
And yet, I never forgot that I was stuck with the numb-brain who let  Mr. Mutant into the house in the  first place-
What - he was supposed to have an arrow and the word ASSASSIN over  his head? All it took was the prospect of a free makeover and you licked his hand like a big, dumb DOG!
Then go. I won't stop you-
Not just any girl. You're special-
I hope these are my last moments! Three more seconds of you and I'm gonna-
Moron!
I hate you!
We so need to get out of here.
Who sponsored career day today - The British Soccer Fan Association?
You want to talk Order of Taraka? We met the king freak of the Order of-
(to Buffy) A slayer? I knew this "I'm the only one, I'm the only one" thing was just an attention getter.
Welcome. So you're a slayer, huh? I like that in a woman.
Good. Great. It's good to be a giver.
Like that.
But this dude was different than the preying mantis lady. He was a man of bugs. Not a man who was a bug.
Man! That guy got some major neck  in his day-
(bridling) Angel's our friend. Except I don't like him.
We got demons. We got monsters.  But no bug dude or Police Lady.
Here we go. I am the Bug Man, coo coo coo chu.
(finds something) Okay. Okay. He can only be killed when he's in his disassembled state.
Disassembled. That means when he's broken down into all his buggy parts-
Dork head? You slash me with your words.
Scuze me, ladies. (to Kendra) Nice knife.
Hey larva boy!
That's right. I'm talking to you - the big cootie.
Welcome, my pretties. Mwa haa haa!
I think he did, Cordy . . .
We need to talk.
Okay. Here's the deal. There is no reason for us to run every time we see each other in the halls.
What happened. There is a total explanation for it-
Me? I seem to recall that I was the jumpee, my friend-
(incredulous) Right. I hired a Latvian Bug Man to kill Buffy so I could kiss you. I hate to burst your bubble, but you don't inspire me to spring for dinner at Bucky's Fondue Hut.
I didn't try it! Forget the bugs. Just the memory of your lips on mine makes my blood run cold-
Like I want anyone to know!
Never happened.
Good!
