BUFFY: Hmmn.
ANGEL: Um, hi. I'm waiting for Buffy.
CORDELIA: Great.
CORDELIA: I'm supposed to be meeting Devon, but he's nowhere to be seen. It's like he thinks being in a band gives him an  obligation to be a flake. Well, his loss is your incredible gain...
CORDELIA: ...So then I told Devon - you call that a leather interior? My Barbie Dream Car had nicer seats-
ANGEL: Buffy?
BUFFY: Oh. Hi. I'm...
ANGEL: Late.
BUFFY: Rough day at the office. 
ANGEL: So I see.
BUFFY: (humiliated) Hey. It's a look. A... seasonal... look.
CORDELIA: Buffy. Love your hair. It just <u>screams</u> street urchin.
BUFFY: You know what? I need to go... put a bag over my head.
ANGEL: Don't listen to her. You look fine.
BUFFY: You're sweet. (then) A terrible liar. But sweet.
ANGEL: I thought we had... you know.
BUFFY: A date? So did I. But who am I kidding? Dates are  things normal girls have. Girls who have time to think  about nail polish and facials and stuff. You know what I think about? Ambush tactics. Beheading.  (then) Not exactly the stuff dreams are made of.
CORDELIA: (to Angel) Cappuccino?
GIRL: Hey!
SNYDER: You're volunteering.
GIRL: But I have to get to class-
WILLOW: Snyder must be in charge of the volunteer safety program for Halloween this year.
XANDER: Note his interesting take on the "volunteer" concept.
BUFFY: What's the deal?
XANDER: A bunch of little kids need people to take them trick-or-treating.  Sign up and you get your very own pack of sugar hyped  runts for the night-
BUFFY: Yikes. I'll stick to vampires-
SNYDER: Ms. Summers. Just the juvenile delinquent I've been looking for.
BUFFY: Principal Snyder-
SNYDER: Halloween must be a big night for you, huh? Tossing eggs. Keying cars. Bobbing for apples. One pathetic cry  for help after another. Well. Not this year, missy.
BUFFY: Gosh, I'd love to volunteer, but I recently developed... carpal tunnel  syndrome and, tragically, I can no longer hold a flash light-
SNYDER: The program starts at four and the children have to be home by six thirty.
XANDER: I can't believe this. We have to dress up and the whole deal?
WILLOW: Snyder said costumes were "mandatory."
BUFFY: Great. I was going to stay in and veg. It's the one night a year that things are supposed to be quiet for me.
XANDER: Halloween quiet? I figured it would be a big old vamp "scare-a-palooza".
BUFFY: Not according to Giles. He swears that tomorrow night is, like, dead for the un-dead. They stay in.
XANDER: Those wacky vampires. That's what I love about 'em. They just keep you guessing.
LARRY: Harris.
XANDER: Larry. Looking very cro mag, as usual. What can I do for you?
LARRY: You and Buffy - you're just friends, right?
XANDER: I like to think of it less as a friendship and more as a solid foundation for future bliss-
LARRY: So she's not your girlfriend?
XANDER: Alas, no.
LARRY: You think she'd go out with me?
XANDER: Well, Lar, that's a hard question to... no. Not a chance.
LARRY: Why not? I heard some guys say she was fast.
XANDER: I hope you mean in the "like the wind" sense.
LARRY: (leering) You know what I mean.
XANDER: That's my friend you're talking about.
LARRY: Oh yeah? What are you going to do about it?
XANDER: I'm going to do what any man would do about it. Something... damn manly.
BUFFY: (to Larry) Get gone.
BUFFY: Ooh. Diet.
XANDER: Do you know what you just did?
BUFFY: Saved a dollar?
XANDER: Larry was about to pummel me.
BUFFY: Oh, that. Forget about it.
XANDER: (fuming) I will. Maybe fifteen, twenty years from now. When my rep for being a sissy-man finally fades.
BUFFY: Xander -
XANDER: A black eye heals, Buffy. But cowardice has a nearly unlimited shelf-life. (then) But thanks. Thanks for your help.
BUFFY: I think I just violated the guy code. Big time. 
WILLOW: Poor Xander. Boys are so fragile.
WILLOW: Speaking of - how was your date last night?
BUFFY: Misfire. I was late due to unscheduled slayage. Showed up looking trashed.
WILLOW: Was he mad?
BUFFY: Actually, he seemed pretty un-mad. Which may have had to do with the fact that Cordelia was drooling in his cappuccino.
WILLOW: Buffy, Angel would never fall for her act.
BUFFY: (worried) Sure. Why would he want a stunning, totally turned-out babe fawning all over him when he could have me - Miss Spin Cycle '97?
WILLOW: You know what I mean. She's not his type.
BUFFY: But how do we know? I mean, what his type is? Or even what his turn-ons and turn-offs are? I've known him for less than a year and, if you haven't noticed, he's not one to over-share.
WILLOW: (innocent) True. It's too bad we can't sneak a look at the watcher diaries and read up on Angel. I'm sure it's full of fun facts to know and tell.
BUFFY: Yeah. Too bad. That stuff is private. 
WILLOW: Also, Giles keeps them in his personal files. In his office, which he never leaves.
BUFFY: Most importantly, it would be wrong.
GILES: Buffy. Excellent. 
BUFFY: (spinning) Nothing! Hi.
GILES: I wanted to talk to you about tomorrow night. As it should be calm, I thought we might work on new battle techniques-
BUFFY: You know, Giles, you're scaring me now. You need to have some fun.
BUFFY: There's this amazing place you can go and sit down in the dark - and there are these moving pictures. And the pictures tell a <u>story</u> -
GILES: Ha, ha. Very droll. I'll have you know I have many relaxing hobbies.
BUFFY: Such as?
GILES: Well. I'm very fond of cross-referencing.
BUFFY: Do you stuff your own shirts or do you send them out?
BUFFY: (turning him back) So, how come Halloween is such a yawner? Do the demons just hate how commercial it's become?
GILES: Well, it's interesting -
GILES: But not, I suspect, to you. What is it you're after?
BUFFY: Well, of course it's of interest! I'm the Slayer! I need to know this stuff! You can't keep me in the dark anymore! (as he almost turns to the office) Look at me when I talk to you!
GILES: Buffy, I don't have time to play games -
BUFFY: Ms. Calendar said you were a babe!
GILES: She said what?
BUFFY: She said, you know, that you were hot. A hunka hunka burning... something or other. So. What do you think of that?
GILES: I, well, um, I don't - a burning hunk of what?
BUFFY: You know, gross as it is for me to contemplate you grown-ups having smootchies, I think you should go for it.
GILES: Buffy, I appreciate your interest, but -
BUFFY: I've overstepped my bounds! It's none of my business. My God, what was I thinking? Shame. <b>SHAME</b>. Gotta go.
GILES: A babe? (smiles) I can live with that.
BUFFY: Man - look at her.
WILLOW: Who is she?
BUFFY: It doesn't say. But the entry is dated 1775.
WILLOW: Angel was 18. And still human.
BUFFY: So this was the kind of girl he hung around. She's pretty... coifed.
WILLOW: She looks like a noblewoman or something, which means being  beautiful was sort of her job.
BUFFY: And, clearly, this girl was a workaholic. Willow - I'll never be like this...
WILLOW: (at a loss) Come on. She's not that pretty. She's got a funny... waist. See how tiny it is?
BUFFY: Now I feel better. Thanks.
WILLOW: No really. She's like a freak. A circus freak. Yuck.
BUFFY: (ignoring her) It must have been wonderful. To put on some fantabulous gown and go to a ball, like a princess... have servants and horses and yet more gowns...
WILLOW: Yeah. (then) Still, I think I prefer being able to vote... or I will, when I can...
CORDELIA: So, Buffy, you ran off and left poor Angel by his lonesome last night.  I did everything I could to comfort him.
BUFFY: I bet.
CORDELIA: What's his story, anyway? I mean, I never see him around.
WILLOW: Not during the day, anyway.
CORDELIA: Please don't tell me he still lives at home. Like he has to wait until his  dad gets home to take the car?
BUFFY: I think his parents have been dead for, um, a couple hundred years.
CORDELIA: Oh, good. I mean- (then) What?
BUFFY: He's a vampire, Cordelia. I thought you knew.
CORDELIA: Oh. He's a vampire. Of course. But the cuddly kind. Like a Care Bear with fangs. 
WILLOW: It's true. 
CORDELIA: You know what I think? You're  rying to scare me off because you're  afraid of the competition. (then) Look Buffy, you may be hot-stuff when it comes to demonology or  whatever, but when it comes to dating - I'm the Slayer.
BUFFY: What did you find?
WILLOW: A time honored classic.
BUFFY: Willow. Can I give you a little friendly advice?
WILLOW: It's not spooky enough?
BUFFY: It's just, you're never going to get noticed if you keep hiding. You're missing the whole point of Halloween.
WILLOW: Free candy?
BUFFY: It's come as you <u>aren't</u> night. The perfect chance for a girl to get sexy and wild with no repercussions. 
WILLOW: I don't get wild. Wild on me equals "spaz."
BUFFY: You've got it in you, Will. You're just scared-
WILLOW: Hey Xander. What did you get?
BUFFY: That's not a costume.
XANDER: I've got some fatigues from the Army surplus at home. Call me the two dollar costume king, baby.
BUFFY: Hey, Xander, about this morning. I'm really sorry-
XANDER: Do you mind, Buffy? I'm trying to repress.
BUFFY: I promise I'll let you get pummeled from now on.
XANDER: Thank you. Okay. Actually, I think I could have-
XANDER: Hello? That was our touching reconciliation you just left.
BUFFY: Sorry... It's just, look at that.
WILLOW: It's... amazing.
XANDER: Too bulky. I prefer my women in spandex.
ETHAN: Please. Let me.
BUFFY: It's -
ETHAN: Magnificent. I know.
ETHAN: My. Meet the hidden princess.
ETHAN: I think we've made a match, don't you?
BUFFY: I'm sorry. There's no way I can afford this.
ETHAN: Nonsense. I feel quite... moved... to make you a deal you can't refuse.
SPIKE: Rewind that. I want to see it again.
SPIKE: She's tricky. Baby likes to play.
SPIKE: (intense) See that? Where she stakes him with that thing? That's what you call <u>resourceful</u>.  (then) Rewind again.
SPIKE: Come here, poodle.
DRUSILLA: Do you love my insides? The parts you can't see?
SPIKE: Eyeballs to entrails, my sweet. That's why I have to study this slayer. Once I know her, I can kill her. And once I kill her, you can have your run of Sunnyhell and get strong again.
DRUSILLA: Don't worry. Everything's switching. Outside to inside. It makes her weak.
SPIKE: Really. Did my pet have a vision?
DRUSILLA: Do you know what I miss? Leeches.
SPIKE: Talk to daddy. This thing that makes the slayer weak. When is it?
DRUSILLA: Tomorrow.
SPIKE: But tomorrow is Halloween. Nothing happens on Halloween.
DRUSILLA: Someone's come to change it all. Someone new.
ETHAN: The world that denies thee, thou inhabit. The peace that ignores thee, thou corrupt.
ETHAN: Chaos. As ever, I am your faithful, degenerate son.
BUFFY: Here. After trick-or-treating. Mom's gonna be out.
BUFFY: Nope. Call it a blast from his past. I'll show him I can coif with the best of 'em. (then) Come on out, Will. You can't stay in there all night.
BUFFY: I won't-
BUFFY: Wow.
BUFFY: Will. You're a dish! I mean, really-
WILLOW: But this just isn't me.
BUFFY: That's the point! Halloween is the night that's <u>not</u> you, is you, but not <u>you</u>, you know?
BUFFY: That's Xander. You ready?
WILLOW: Yeah. Okay.
BUFFY: Cool! I can't wait to watch the boys go non-verbal when they see you.
XANDER: Private Harris. Reporting for-
XANDER: Buffy. My Lady of Buffdom. The duchess of Buffonia. I am in awe. I completely renounce spandex.
BUFFY: Thank you, kind sir. But wait till you see -
BUFFY: --Casper.
XANDER: Hey, Will. That's- (re: "BOO" on sheet) --a fine "BOO" you have there.
LARRY: Where's your bodyguard, Harris? Curling her hair?
SNYDER: Here's your group, Summers. No need to speak to them -  the last thing they need is your influence. Just bring them back  in one piece and I won't expel you.
CORDELIA: Oz. OZ.
OZ: Cordelia. You're like a great big cat.
CORDELIA: That's my costume. Are you guys playing tonight?
OZ: At the shelter club.
CORDELIA: Is mister "I'm the lead singer I'm so great I don't have to  show up for a date or even call" gonna be there?
OZ: Yeah. You know, he's just going by "Devon" now.
CORDELIA: Well, you can tell him that I don't care, and that I didn't even  mention it and I didn't even see you so that's just fine.
OZ: So what do I tell him?
CORDELIA: NOTHING! Jeez, get with the program.
OZ: Why can't I meet a nice girl like that?
OZ: Sorry.
WILLOW: Sorry.
OZ: Sorry.
XANDER: Okay. On sleazing extra candy. Tears are key. Tears'll usually  get you a double-bagger. You can also try the old "you missed me" routine - but it's risky. Only go there for chocolate. Understood?
XANDER: Good. Troops... Let's move out.
BUFFY: What'd Mrs. Davis give you?
BUFFY: She must be stopped. (brightly) Let's hit one more house. We still have a few minutes  before we've got to get back.
ETHAN: (in latin) <janus, this="">BR Take plea. my hear&gt;night as your own. Come forth and show us your truth.&gt;</janus,>
KIDS: Trick or treat!
PARKER: Oh my goodness. Aren't you adorable!
ETHAN: (in Latin) <the flesh.<br="" is="" made="" mask="">The heart is curdled by your  holy presence. Janus, this night is <u>yours</u>!&gt;</the>
PARKER: Oh, dear. Am I all out? I could have sworn I had some candy left -
ETHAN: Show time.
PARKER: I'm sorry, Mr. Monster. Maybe I-
WILLOW: Let her go!
WILLOW: What- What's-
WILLOW: Oh. Oh my God...
WILLOW: I'm a... I'm a real ghost -
WILLOW: Xander!
WILLOW: Xander, it's me. Willow!
XANDER: I don't know any Willow.
WILLOW: Quit messing around, Xander. This is no time for jokes.
XANDER: What the Hell is going on here?
WILLOW: You don't know me?
XANDER: Lady, I suggest you find cover.
WILLOW: No, wait!
WILLOW: Oooh.
XANDER: What are you?!
WILLOW: Xander. Listen to me. I'm on your side, I swear. Something crazy is  happening. I was dressed as a ghost for Halloween and now I <u>am</u> a ghost.  You were supposed to be a soldier, and now, I guess you're a real soldier-
XANDER: And you expect me to believe that?
WILLOW: No! No guns. That's still a little kid in there-
XANDER: But-
WILLOW: No GUNS. That's an order. Let's just get -
WILLOW: Buffy!
WILLOW: Buffy, are you okay?
XANDER: This could be a situation.
WILLOW: Buffy, what do we do?
WILLOW: Buffy! Are you all right?
BUFFY: What?
XANDER: Are you hurt?
WILLOW: Buffy, are you <b>hurt</b>?
BUFFY: Buffy?
WILLOW: (to Xander, fears confirmed) She's not Buffy.
XANDER: Who's Buffy?
WILLOW: Oh, this is fun. (to Buffy) What year is this?
BUFFY: Seventeen seventy five... I believe... I don't understand.  Who are you?
WILLOW: We're friends. 
BUFFY: Friends of whom? Your dress is... everything is strange... (panic rising) How did I come to be here?
WILLOW: Okay, breathe, okay? You're gonna faint again. (to Xander) How are we supposed to get through this without the Slayer?
XANDER: What's a Slayer?
XANDER: I suggest we get inside before we run into any other -
BUFFY: Demon! A demon!
WILLOW: It's not a demon. It's a car.
BUFFY: What does it want?
XANDER: (to Willow) Is this woman insane?
WILLOW: She's never seen a car.
XANDER: She's never seen a car.
WILLOW: She's from the past.
XANDER: And you're a ghost?
WILLOW: <b>Yes</b>. Now let's get inside.
XANDER: I just want you to know I'm taking a lot on faith here.  Where do we go?
WILLOW: (thinks) Where's the closest - Uh, we can go to a friend's house.
XANDER: I think we're clear.
WILLOW: (calls out) Hello! Mrs. Summers? (no response) Good. She's gone.
BUFFY: Where are we?
WILLOW: Your place. Now we just need to -
WILLOW: Don't open it!
XANDER: It could be a civilian.
WILLOW: Or a mini-demon.
BUFFY: This... this could be me...
WILLOW: It is you. Buffy, can't you remember at all?
BUFFY: No, I... I don't understand any of this, and I... (re: picture) This is some other girl, I would never wear this... this low apparel and I don't like this place and I don't like you and I just want to go <b>home</b>!
WILLOW: You <b>are</b> home!
WILLOW: You couldn't have dressed up like Xena...
WILLOW: Not a civilian.
XANDER: Affirmative.
WILLOW: Hey! What'd we say?
XANDER: Big noise scare monster. Remember?
WILLOW: Got it.
XANDER: Dammit.
BUFFY: Surely he'll not desert us?
WILLOW: (just had enough) Whatever...
CORDELIA: Xander?
XANDER: Come inside.
WILLOW: Cordelia!
CORDELIA: What's going on?
WILLOW: Okay - your name is Cordelia, you're not a cat, you're in high  school, we're your friends - well, sort of -
CORDELIA: That's nice, Willow, and you went mental <b>when</b>?
WILLOW: You know us?
CORDELIA: Yeah, lucky me. What's with the name game?
WILLOW: A lot's going on.
CORDELIA: No kidding. I was just attacked by Jo-Jo the dogfaced boy. Look at  my costume! Think Party-Town's gonna give me my deposit back?  Not on the likely.
XANDER: Here.
CORDELIA: Thanks.
WILLOW: Okay. You three stay here while I get help. If something tries to get in, just fight it off.
BUFFY: It's not our place to fight. Surely some men will come and protect us?
CORDELIA: What's <b>that</b> riff?
WILLOW: It's like amnesia, okay? They don't know who they are. Just sit tight.
CORDELIA: Who died and made her the boss?
SPIKE: Well, this is just... neat.
BUFFY: Surely there's somewhere we can go? Some safe haven?
XANDER: The lady said stay put. (to Cordy) Check upstairs. Make sure everything's locked.
BUFFY: (to Xander, genuinely confused) You would take orders from a woman? Are you feeble in some way?
XANDER: Ma'am, in the army we have a saying. Sit down and shut the - whoah.
XANDER: She must be right. We must have some kind of amnesia.
BUFFY: I don't know what that is but I'm sure I don't have it.  I bathe quite often.
XANDER: (re: picture) How do you explain this?
BUFFY: I don't! I was brought up as a proper lady. I'm not meant to  understand things. I'm just meant to look good and then someone nice will marry me. Possibly a baron.
XANDER: This isn't a tea party, princess. Sooner or later, you're going to have to fight.
BUFFY: Fight? These low creatures? I'd sooner die.
XANDER: Then you'll die.
ANGEL: It's total chaos out there.
XANDER: Who are you?
GILES: GNYEHAHH!
WILLOW: Hi.
ANGEL: Okay, does somebody want to fill me in?
XANDER: Do you live here?
ANGEL: No! You know that. Buffy... I'm lost here. You... (suddenly peering) What's up with your hair?
CORDELIA: (entering) They don't know who they are, everyone's become a monster,  it's a whole big thing. How are you?
CORDELIA: Do you mind?
XANDER: (to Angel) Take the princess here and secure the kitchen. Catwoman, you're with me.
BUFFY: But, I don't want to go with you - I like the man with the musket.
ANGEL: Come on.
BUFFY: Do you have a musket?
ANGEL: I didn't leave that open.
ANGEL: Look out!
ANGEL: A stake!
BUFFY: What?
ANGEL: Get me a stake!
ANGEL: Buffy, no!
WILLOW: I don't even know what to look for. Plus I can't turn the page.
GILES: Right. Okay, then, let's review. At sundown, everyone became  whatever they were masquerading as-
WILLOW: Right. Xander was a soldier and Buffy was an 18th century girl. 
GILES: And - your costume?
WILLOW: I'm a ghost.
GILES: Yes, but a ghost of <u>what</u>, exactly?
WILLOW: (embarrassed) This is nothing. You should have seen what Cordelia was wearing. A unitard. And these little cat things. Ears and stuff.
GILES: Good heavens. Cordelia became an actual feline?
WILLOW: (realizing) No. She was still just the same old Cordelia, just in a cat costume.
GILES: She didn't change.
WILLOW: No. Hold on... Party Town. She told us she got her outfit from Party Town-
GILES: And everybody who changed, where did they acquire their costumes?
WILLOW: We all got ours at this new place. Ethan's.
XANDER: You're sure she came this way?
ANGEL: No.
CORDELIA: She'll be okay.
ANGEL: BUFFY would be okay. Whoever she is now, she's helpless. Come on.
SPIKE: Do you hear that, my friends? Somewhere out here is the tenderest  meat you've ever tasted. And all we have to do...
GILES: Hello? Is anyone in?
WILLOW: Giles.
GILES: That's Janus, a Roman mystical God.
WILLOW: What does it mean?
GILES: Primarily, it represents the division of self. Male and female. Light and dark-
GILES: Willow. Get out of here. Now.
WILLOW: But -
GILES: NOW, Willow.
GILES: Hello, Ethan.
ETHAN: Hello, Ripper.
BUFFY: (weakly) No... No...
CORDELIA: Buffy? Are you okay?
CORDELIA: (to Buffy) What is your deal? Take a pill!
BUFFY: (re: Angel) He's... he's a vampire!
CORDELIA: (to Angel) She's got this thing where she thinks - ah, forget it. (humoring her) It's okay. Angel is... a good vampire. He'd never hurt you.
BUFFY: He - really?
CORDELIA: Absolutely. Angel is our friend.
XANDER: (to Angel) It's a strange, but... beating up that pirate gave me a  strange sense of closure.
WILLOW: Guys!
ANGEL: Willow!
WILLOW: You guys gotta get inside.
XANDER: We need to triage.
ANGEL: This way.
XANDER: Ladies... we're on the move.
ETHAN: What, no hug? Aren't you happy to see your old mate?
GILES: I'm surprised I didn't guess it was you. This Halloween stunt stinks of Ethan Rayne.
ETHAN: (proud) It does, doesn't it? Not to blow my own horn, but - it's genius.  The very embodiment of "be careful what you wish for."
GILES: It's sick. And brutal. It harms the innocent-
ETHAN: (wry) Oh, and we all know that <u>you</u> are the champion of innocence and all things pure and good, Rupert.  (then) This is quite an act you've got going here, old man.
GILES: It's no act. It's who I am.
ETHAN: It's who you are? The Watcher? Sniveling tweed-clad guardian of the Slayer and her kin? I think not. I know who you are. And  I know what you're capable of.  (then/realizing) But they don't do they? They have no idea where you come from.
GILES: Break the spell, Ethan. Then leave this place and never come back.
ETHAN: Why should I? What do I get in the bargain?
GILES: You get to live.
ETHAN: Ooooh. You're scaring-
ANGEL: Over here!
XANDER: Check and see if there are any other ways in!
ANGEL: Just stay here.
CORDELIA: Faboo. More clinging.
ETHAN: And you said "Rupert the Ripper" was long gone...
GILES: How do I stop the spell?
ETHAN: Say pretty ple-
ETHAN: Janus. Break the statue.
SPIKE: Look at you. Shaking, terrified. Alone. Lost little lamb.
SPIKE: I love it.
ANGEL: Buffy!
WILLOW: Now THAT guy, you can shoot.
XANDER: What the - ?
BUFFY: Hi Honey. I'm home.
BUFFY: You know what? It's good to be me.
XANDER: Hey, Buff. Welcome back.
BUFFY: Yeah. You too.
CORDELIA: You guys remember what happened?
XANDER: It was way creepy. Like I was there - but I couldn't get out.
CORDELIA: (to Angel) I know the feeling. This outfit is totally skin-tight-
ANGEL: You okay?
BUFFY: Yeah.
CORDELIA: Hello? It felt like I was talking. My lips were moving-
XANDER: Give it up, Cordy. You're never going to get between those two.  Believe me. I know.
CORDELIA: I guess we should get them back to their parents.
XANDER: Yeah. It seems like everybody is- (then/realizing) Where's Willow.
OZ: Who IS that girl?
BUFFY: Taa daa. Just little old 20th century me.
ANGEL: Are you sure you're okay?
BUFFY: I'll live.
ANGEL: I don't get it Buffy. Why did you think I'd like you better  dressed that way?
BUFFY: I - I just wanted to be a real girl, for once. The kind of fancy girl you liked when you were my age.
BUFFY: What?
ANGEL: I hated the girls back then. Especially the noblewomen.
BUFFY: You did?
ANGEL: They were just incredibly Dull. Simpering morons, the lot of them.  I always wished I could meet someone... exciting. Interesting.
BUFFY: Really. Interesting - like how?
ANGEL: You know how.
BUFFY: Still, I've had a hard day and you should tell me.
ANGEL: I should.
BUFFY: Oh - definitely...
