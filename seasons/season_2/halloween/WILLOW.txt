Snyder must be in charge of the volunteer safety program for Halloween this year.
Snyder said costumes were "mandatory."
Poor Xander. Boys are so fragile.
Speaking of - how was your date last night?
Was he mad?
Buffy, Angel would never fall for her act.
You know what I mean. She's not his type.
(innocent) True. It's too bad we can't sneak a look at the watcher diaries and read up on Angel. I'm sure it's full of fun facts to know and tell.
Also, Giles keeps them in his personal files. In his office, which he never leaves.
Who is she?
Angel was 18. And still human.
She looks like a noblewoman or something, which means being  beautiful was sort of her job.
(at a loss) Come on. She's not that pretty. She's got a funny... waist. See how tiny it is?
No really. She's like a freak. A circus freak. Yuck.
Yeah. (then) Still, I think I prefer being able to vote... or I will, when I can...
Not during the day, anyway.
It's true. 
A time honored classic.
It's not spooky enough?
Free candy?
I don't get wild. Wild on me equals "spaz."
Hey Xander. What did you get?
It's... amazing.
But this just isn't me.
Yeah. Okay.
Sorry.
Let her go!
What- What's-
Oh. Oh my God...
I'm a... I'm a real ghost -
Xander!
Xander, it's me. Willow!
Quit messing around, Xander. This is no time for jokes.
You don't know me?
No, wait!
Oooh.
Xander. Listen to me. I'm on your side, I swear. Something crazy is  happening. I was dressed as a ghost for Halloween and now I <u>am</u> a ghost.  You were supposed to be a soldier, and now, I guess you're a real soldier-
No! No guns. That's still a little kid in there-
No GUNS. That's an order. Let's just get -
Buffy!
Buffy, are you okay?
Buffy, what do we do?
Buffy! Are you all right?
Buffy, are you <b>hurt</b>?
(to Xander, fears confirmed) She's not Buffy.
Oh, this is fun. (to Buffy) What year is this?
We're friends. 
Okay, breathe, okay? You're gonna faint again. (to Xander) How are we supposed to get through this without the Slayer?
It's not a demon. It's a car.
She's never seen a car.
She's from the past.
<b>Yes</b>. Now let's get inside.
(thinks) Where's the closest - Uh, we can go to a friend's house.
(calls out) Hello! Mrs. Summers? (no response) Good. She's gone.
Your place. Now we just need to -
Don't open it!
Or a mini-demon.
It is you. Buffy, can't you remember at all?
You <b>are</b> home!
You couldn't have dressed up like Xena...
Not a civilian.
Hey! What'd we say?
Got it.
(just had enough) Whatever...
Cordelia!
Okay - your name is Cordelia, you're not a cat, you're in high  school, we're your friends - well, sort of -
You know us?
A lot's going on.
Okay. You three stay here while I get help. If something tries to get in, just fight it off.
It's like amnesia, okay? They don't know who they are. Just sit tight.
Hi.
I don't even know what to look for. Plus I can't turn the page.
Right. Xander was a soldier and Buffy was an 18th century girl. 
I'm a ghost.
(embarrassed) This is nothing. You should have seen what Cordelia was wearing. A unitard. And these little cat things. Ears and stuff.
(realizing) No. She was still just the same old Cordelia, just in a cat costume.
No. Hold on... Party Town. She told us she got her outfit from Party Town-
We all got ours at this new place. Ethan's.
Giles.
What does it mean?
But -
Guys!
You guys gotta get inside.
Now THAT guy, you can shoot.
