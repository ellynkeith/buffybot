Um, hi. I'm waiting for Buffy.
Buffy?
Late.
So I see.
Don't listen to her. You look fine.
I thought we had... you know.
It's total chaos out there.
Okay, does somebody want to fill me in?
No! You know that. Buffy... I'm lost here. You... (suddenly peering) What's up with your hair?
Come on.
I didn't leave that open.
Look out!
A stake!
Get me a stake!
Buffy, no!
No.
BUFFY would be okay. Whoever she is now, she's helpless. Come on.
Willow!
This way.
Over here!
Just stay here.
Buffy!
You okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
I don't get it Buffy. Why did you think I'd like you better  dressed that way?
I hated the girls back then. Especially the noblewomen.
They were just incredibly Dull. Simpering morons, the lot of them.  I always wished I could meet someone... exciting. Interesting.
You know how.
I should.
