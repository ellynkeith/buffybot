Note his interesting take on the "volunteer" concept.
A bunch of little kids need people to take them trick-or-treating.  Sign up and you get your very own pack of sugar hyped  runts for the night-
I can't believe this. We have to dress up and the whole deal?
Halloween quiet? I figured it would be a big old vamp "scare-a-palooza".
Those wacky vampires. That's what I love about 'em. They just keep you guessing.
Larry. Looking very cro mag, as usual. What can I do for you?
I like to think of it less as a friendship and more as a solid foundation for future bliss-
Alas, no.
Well, Lar, that's a hard question to... no. Not a chance.
I hope you mean in the "like the wind" sense.
That's my friend you're talking about.
I'm going to do what any man would do about it. Something... damn manly.
Do you know what you just did?
Larry was about to pummel me.
(fuming) I will. Maybe fifteen, twenty years from now. When my rep for being a sissy-man finally fades.
A black eye heals, Buffy. But cowardice has a nearly unlimited shelf-life. (then) But thanks. Thanks for your help.
I've got some fatigues from the Army surplus at home. Call me the two dollar costume king, baby.
Do you mind, Buffy? I'm trying to repress.
Thank you. Okay. Actually, I think I could have-
Hello? That was our touching reconciliation you just left.
Too bulky. I prefer my women in spandex.
Private Harris. Reporting for-
Buffy. My Lady of Buffdom. The duchess of Buffonia. I am in awe. I completely renounce spandex.
Hey, Will. That's- (re: "BOO" on sheet) --a fine "BOO" you have there.
Okay. On sleazing extra candy. Tears are key. Tears'll usually  get you a double-bagger. You can also try the old "you missed me" routine - but it's risky. Only go there for chocolate. Understood?
Good. Troops... Let's move out.
I don't know any Willow.
What the Hell is going on here?
Lady, I suggest you find cover.
What are you?!
And you expect me to believe that?
But-
This could be a situation.
Are you hurt?
Who's Buffy?
What's a Slayer?
I suggest we get inside before we run into any other -
(to Willow) Is this woman insane?
She's never seen a car.
And you're a ghost?
I just want you to know I'm taking a lot on faith here.  Where do we go?
I think we're clear.
It could be a civilian.
Affirmative.
Big noise scare monster. Remember?
Dammit.
Come inside.
Here.
The lady said stay put. (to Cordy) Check upstairs. Make sure everything's locked.
Ma'am, in the army we have a saying. Sit down and shut the - whoah.
She must be right. We must have some kind of amnesia.
(re: picture) How do you explain this?
This isn't a tea party, princess. Sooner or later, you're going to have to fight.
Then you'll die.
Who are you?
Do you live here?
(to Angel) Take the princess here and secure the kitchen. Catwoman, you're with me.
You're sure she came this way?
(to Angel) It's a strange, but... beating up that pirate gave me a  strange sense of closure.
We need to triage.
Ladies... we're on the move.
Check and see if there are any other ways in!
What the - ?
Hey, Buff. Welcome back.
It was way creepy. Like I was there - but I couldn't get out.
Give it up, Cordy. You're never going to get between those two.  Believe me. I know.
Yeah. It seems like everybody is- (then/realizing) Where's Willow.
