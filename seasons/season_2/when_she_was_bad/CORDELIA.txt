It was a nightmare. A nightmare. They  <b>promised</b> me we were going to St. Croix  and then at the last minute, they just <b>decide </b> we're gonna visit Tuscany instead. Art.  Buildings. Totally beachless for a month  and a half. No one has suffered as I have  suffered. Of course I think that kind of  adversity builds character. But then I  thought, well I already <b>have</b> a lot of  character, I mean it is possible to have  too much character, isn't it?

Buffy.

What an ordeal. And you know the worst  part: It stays with you forever. No matter  what they tell you, none of that rust and  blood and grime comes out.

The stains.  CORDELIA I hear you.
