Mind if I come in?  BUFFY (noncommittally) Be my guest.
How are you?  BUFFY Peachy.
(bridling slightly) It's not a social call.  BUFFY And that means grave danger. Gosh,  it's so good to be home.  ANGEL I'm sorry. I wish I had better news.  BUFFY Let me guess. Some of your cousins  have come for a family barbecue,  and we're all on the menu.  ANGEL The Anointed One. He's been gathering  forces somewhere in town. I'm not sure why.  BUFFY I guess I'll find out soon enough.   ANGEL You don't sound too concerned.  BUFFY I can handle myself. I could use a little  action, anyway.  ANGEL Don't underestimate the Anointed One just because he looks a child. He has power over the rest of them. Its source is deep, and old. They'll do anything for him.  BUFFY Is that it? Is that everything? 'Cause  you woke me up from a really nice  dream.  ANGEL Sorry. I'll go.
Don't you have somewhere to be?
Buffy. Buffy!
It's okay... it's okay...
