WILLOW: Okay, hold on...  XANDER It's your turn.  WILLOW Okay, Um... "In the few hours that we  had together, we loved a lifetimes worth."  XANDER <u>Terminator</u>.  WILLOW Good. Right.  XANDER Okay. Let's see... (Charlton Heston) 'It's a madhouse! A m--  WILLOW <u>Planet of the Apes</u>.  XANDER Can I finish, please?  WILLOW Sorry. Go ahead.   XANDER 'Madhouse!'
WILLOW: <u>Planet of the Apes</u>. Good. Me now. Um...  XANDER Well?  WILLOW I'm thinking. Okay. 'Use the force, Luke.' 
XANDER: Do I really have to dignify that with a guess?  WILLOW I didn't think of anything. It's a dumb game anyway. 
XANDER: You got something better to do? We played  rock-paper-scissors long enough, okay?  My hand cramped up.  WILLOW Well, sure, if you're ALWAYS scissors,  of course your tendons are gonna stretch --  XANDER (interrupting) You know, I gotta say, this has really  been the most boring summer ever.  WILLOW Yeah, but on the plus side, no monsters  or stuff.
XANDER: I know, but I'm so restless! I'm actually  glad school is starting again.  WILLOW Yeah, and that has nothing to do with a  certain girl that we both know that is a  vampire slayer?
XANDER: Please. I'm so over her. (REAL casual) Did she, uh, say when she was getting  back, about which I don't care?  WILLOW I haven't heard from her. I mean, I got a  couple of postcards after she went to L.A.  and then, like, nothing.  XANDER Yeah, I never heard... well, she's probably  having fun with her dad.  WILLOW And you don't care.  XANDER Okay, so maybe there's some interest. I'm  a man, I have certain desires. Certain needs...  WILLOW I don't wanna know.  XANDER Don't you?
WILLOW: Xander...  XANDER Come on. (dabs again) You're Amish, you won't fight back  because you're Amish, I mock you  with my ice cream cone, Amish Guy...  WILLOW <u>Witness</u>. My nose is cold.  XANDER Let me get that --
WILLOW: Xander!  XANDER What can I say? It makes your nose look  tasty. 
XANDER: (stepping in front of her) Willow, go!  WILLOW Xander --
BUFFY: Miss me?
WILLOW: Buffy!  BUFFY Hey, Will.  XANDER Man, your timing really doesn't suck.  WILLOW When did you get back?  BUFFY Just now. Dad drove me down. And I  knew you losers would be getting into  some kind of trouble.   WILLOW I think we had the upper hand. In a  subtle way.  BUFFY Does either of you even have a cross?  Very sloppy...  XANDER Well, it's been a slow summer. That was  the first vampire we've seen since you  killed the Master.  BUFFY It's like they knew I was coming back.  XANDER What about you? How was your summer?  Did you slay anything? 
BUFFY: Strictly R&amp;R. Hung out, partied...  shopping was also a major theme.
XANDER: Well, you haven't lost your touch.  That vampire --  BUFFY I did kind of wail on him, didn't I?  XANDER I really like your hair.  BUFFY So, how did you guys fare? Did you  have any fun without me?
XANDER: No.
XANDER: No.
WILLOW: Yes.
WILLOW: That's right, you missed it! Right out  by that tree.
WILLOW: Giles buried the bones and we poured holy  water and chanted and we got to wear robes!  XANDER Very intense. You shoulda been.  WILLOW Have you see Giles? 
BUFFY: Why would I call Giles? I'll see him at  school.
XANDER: Man, I'm really glad you're back.  BUFFY Yeah. (unconvincingly, as she looks at the tree) Me too. 
JOYCE: More clothes?  HANK (guiltily) Uh, do shoes count as clothes?  JOYCE (re: large suitcase) That's shoes? How much shopping did  you let her do?  HANK Oh, I'm spoiling her. Did I forget to  mention that?  JOYCE What you forgot is that I'm gonna  have to deal with another year of  'Daddy would let me buy that.'  HANK I just thought I'd save you from the big  back-to-school clothes nightmare.  JOYCE My nightmares about Buffy and school  have nothing to do with clothes. Did she  manage to stay out of trouble in L.A.?  HANK She did, yeah. She was, you know... great.
JOYCE: But.  HANK She was just... I don't know. Distant.  Not brooding, or sulking, just... there  was no connection. All on the surface.  The more time we spent together, the  more I felt like she was nowhere to be  seen.  JOYCE Hence the shoes.  HANK I may have been overcompensating a little.  It was strange. At least when she was burning  stuff down I knew what to say. As for  example, 'don't burn stuff down'. But now...  JOYCE Welcome to my world. I haven't been  able to get through to her for so long...  I'll just be happy if she makes it through  the school year.
CORDELIA: It was a nightmare. A nightmare. They  <b>promised</b> me we were going to St. Croix  and then at the last minute, they just <b>decide </b> we're gonna visit Tuscany instead. Art.  Buildings. Totally beachless for a month  and a half. No one has suffered as I have  suffered. Of course I think that kind of  adversity builds character. But then I  thought, well I already <b>have</b> a lot of  character, I mean it is possible to have  too much character, isn't it? 
SNYDER: The first day back. It always get me.  GILES Yes.  MR SNYDER I mean, it's incredible. One day the  campus is completely bare, empty...  the next, children are everywhere.  Like locusts. Crawling around,  mindlessly bent on feeding and  mating, destroying everything in sight  in their relentless, pointless desire  to exist.  GILES I do love these pep talks. Have you ever  considered, given your abhorrence of  children, that school principal is perhaps  not your true vocation?  MR SNYDER Someone's gotta keep an eye on 'em.  They're just a bunch of hormonal timebombs.  Why, every time a pretty girl walks by,  every boy turns into a jibbering fool.  GILES Ms. Calendar!
JENNY: Mr. Giles.  GILES (jibbering fool) Well, uh, dyeh, nnn, hello.
SNYDER: I've seen the way these kids gaze at  each other, all moony -- 
JENNY: It's good to see you.  GILES Yes.  MR SNYDER You think they're thinking about  learning?  GILES Are you heading towards the faculty  room?  JENNY That sounds like fun.  MR SNYDER I try to talk sense to 'em, tell 'em about  the really important things in life.  Responsibility, discipline, punctuality...  I might as well be talking to myself. 
GILES: And how was your summer?  JENNY Extreme. I did Burning Man in Black Rock.  It's such a great festival -- you should have  been there. There were drum rituals, naked  mud-dances, raves, mobile sculptures, you  would have just... hated it with a fiery passion.
GILES: Yes, I can't imagine finding any redeeming  -- naked?
JENNY: You probably spent all summer with your  nose in a book.  GILES I suppose you'd consider that terribly dull.   JENNY (flirtatiously) Depends on the book.
WILLOW: Giles!  XANDER Hey. G-man! What's up?  GILES Nice to see you and don't ever call  me that.  JENNY Hey, kids.  GILES (to Buffy) How are you?  BUFFY Alive and kicking.  WILLOW Buffy killed a vampire last night!  
BUFFY: Uh, I think you can get a little more  volume if you speak from the diaphragm.  WILLOW Sorry.
JENNY: We got vampires? I thought the  Hellmouth was closed.  GILES Closed, not gone. The mystical energy  it emits is still concentrated in this area.  XANDER Which means we're still the undead's  favorite party town.  GILES (to Buffy) This vampire -- could you tell where he  might be from?  BUFFY Local talent. Fresh. He was still wearing his  funeral ensemble.  GILES Which means there are other vampires  about, and they're already killing. I  should have been on top of that.  I wonder if they're here for some  particular purpose...  BUFFY You're the Watcher. I just work here.  GILES Well, I have to consult my books.  XANDER (looking at his watch) Eight minutes and thirty three seconds. (to Willow) Pay up. 
WILLOW: We better get to class.  The three kids start off.  GILES Buffy. (she stops, turns) I realize you've only just returned,  but when you're ready, I think we  should start your training again.  BUFFY I'm ready. I'll see you after school.  GILES Well, I understand if you need a few  days to --  BUFFY I'm ready. 
GILES: Buffy... I think that's enough... Buffy!
BUFFY: Well, I'm ready for anything those  vampires want to throw at me.  CUT TO:
ABSALOM: We have been put down, my kinsmen.  We have lost our way, and we have lost  the night. But despair is for the living.  Where they are weak, we will be strong.  Where they weep, we rejoice. Where  they bleed, we drink. Within these three  days a new hope shall rise. We put our  faith in <b>him</b>...
XANDER: Buffy. Buffy! 
BUFFY: Fine! I'm fine!  XANDER (huh?) Good. It's good that you're fine.  WILLOW What were you thinking about?  BUFFY Nothing.  XANDER Come on, you can tell us! We're your  bosom friends. The friends of your  bosom.  WILLOW Xander...  BUFFY I wasn't thinking anything. Really. Did I  have think-face? 'Cause there was nothing  going on.
WILLOW: What'd you do last night?  BUFFY Slept.
XANDER: Dreams are meaningful.  WILLOW They sure are. The other night I dreamt  that Xander-- (stops herself) Uh, it wasn't Xander. In fact, it wasn't me.  It was a friend's dream, and they don't  remember it.  BUFFY (smiling) I'll bet they don't.
GILES: This vampire activity -- I think I  know what they're up to.  BUFFY Well, don't stress. We'll deal.  GILES I hope it's that simple.  BUFFY It is not to sweat. Trust me.   GILES I don't know. I mean, I killed you once.  It shouldn't be too difficult to do it again.  BUFFY (it stops her) What?
BUFFY: Hello.
ANGEL: Mind if I come in?  BUFFY (noncommittally) Be my guest.
ANGEL: How are you?  BUFFY Peachy.
ANGEL: (bridling slightly) It's not a social call.  BUFFY And that means grave danger. Gosh,  it's so good to be home.  ANGEL I'm sorry. I wish I had better news.  BUFFY Let me guess. Some of your cousins  have come for a family barbecue,  and we're all on the menu.  ANGEL The Anointed One. He's been gathering  forces somewhere in town. I'm not sure why.  BUFFY I guess I'll find out soon enough.   ANGEL You don't sound too concerned.  BUFFY I can handle myself. I could use a little  action, anyway.  ANGEL Don't underestimate the Anointed One just because he looks a child. He has power over the rest of them. Its source is deep, and old. They'll do anything for him.  BUFFY Is that it? Is that everything? 'Cause  you woke me up from a really nice  dream.  ANGEL Sorry. I'll go.
BUFFY: I missed --
WILLOW: Angel came by? Wow. Was there,  I mean, was it having to do with  kissing?  BUFFY Willow, grow up. Not everything is  about kissing.  XANDER Yeah! Some stuff is about groping. (to Buffy, worried) It wasn't about groping?  BUFFY Hello, Hormones on Parade... it was  pure shop talk. You know, vampires?  Ring a bell? Pointy teeth, they walk  by night...  WILLOW What'd he say?  BUFFY (shrugs) Something's up. Nothing I can't handle.  XANDER Oh! Hey! Did you guys know? Cibo  Matto is gonna be at The Bronze tonight  WILLOW Cibo Matto? They're playing?
XANDER: No, Willow, they'll be clog-dancing.  WILLOW (excited) Cibo Matto can clog-dance? -- Oh,  sarcasm. Right.  XANDER (to Buffy) We should attend, no? If you're not  busy with fighting or anything.  BUFFY Sounds like fun.
CORDELIA: (witheringly) Oh, look. It's the Three Musketeers.
BUFFY: Was that an insult?  XANDER Kinda lacked punch.  WILLOW The Three Musketeers were cool.  CORDELIA (considering) I see your point...  XANDER I would have gone with 'Stooges'.  CORDELIA Well, I just meant you all hang out  together. So, did you guys fight demons  all summer?
WILLOW: Yes! Our own personal demons!  XANDER Such as lust... and, uh... thrift.
BUFFY: (re: the other two) I think I would have to go with  'Stooges' also.  CORDELIA What are you guys talking about? I'm  talking about big squiggly demons that  come from the ground. Remember, on  prom night, with all the vampires?  BUFFY Cordelia. Your mouth is open. Sound  is coming from it. This is never good.
XANDER: You see, we can't mention that stuff  in front of other people. Buffy being  the Slayer and all.  WILLOW You haven't been talking about your  little adventure all summer, have you?  CORDELIA Are you nuts? You think I would tell  anyone that I spent the evening with  you guys? Besides, it was all so creepy.  That Master guy, screaming...
BUFFY: That works out great. You don't tell  anyone I'm the Slayer, and I won't  tell anyone that you're a moron.
XANDER: See, now that was a good insult.  WILLOW A little TOO good...
CORDELIA: What's up with her?  WILLOW I don't know. 
WILLOW: I just think something's up, is all.  XANDER Willow, you're paranoid.  WILLOW Buffy's never acted like this before.  Ever since she got back, she's different.  XANDER Buffy's always been different.  WILLOW She's never been mean.  XANDER (cranes to look for her) Any sign of her? She said she was coming.  WILLOW No... The band's cool though.  XANDER (distracted) Yeah. Cool.
ABSALOM: Dig. All of you. We have to hurry. 
ONE: Dig. 
BUFFY: Oh. Hi again.  ANGEL Hi.  BUFFY Is there danger at the Bronze?  ANGEL I can't help thinking I've done something to make you angry. That bothers me  more than I'd like.  BUFFY I'm not angry. I have no idea where that comes from.  ANGEL What are you afraid of? Me? Us?  BUFFY Uh, could you contemplate getting  over yourself? There's no 'us'. I'm  sorry if I was supposed to spend the  summer mooning over you, but I  didn't. I moved on. To the living.
WILLOW: What's wrong with Angel?  BUFFY Beats me.
XANDER: Uh, uh...
BUFFY: Xander, did I ever thank you for saving my life?  XANDER No.
BUFFY: Don't you wish I would?
CORDELIA: Buffy.
BUFFY: As defending champion, are you  nervous?  CORDELIA I can hold my own. (stepping forward) We've never been close, Buffy, which  is nice, 'cause I don't like you very  much. But you have, on occasion,  saved the world and all that stuff,  so I'm gonna do you a favor.  BUFFY Joyous me.  CORDELIA Your friends can't do it, 'cause they  like you. And they're sort of afraid  of you.  BUFFY What's the favor?  CORDELIA I'm going to give you some advice.  Get over it.  BUFFY Excuse me?  CORDELIA Whatever's causing the Joan Collins  'tude, deal with it, embrace the pain,  spank your inner moppet but <b>get over it</b>,  'cause pretty soon you won't even have  the loser friends you've got now.  BUFFY I'd say it's about time for you to mind  your own business.  CORDELIA It's long past. Nighty night.
CORDELIA: Ms. Calendar? Oh God...
BUFFY: He's dead, he's dead... he's dead... 
JOYCE: How are your new classes.  BUFFY (not looking at her) Good.  JOYCE Good.
GILES: Possessed?  WILLOW It's the only explanation that makes  any sense. You should have seen her  last night. That wasn't Buffy.  XANDER Are we overlooking the idea that she  may just be very attracted to me? (off Willow's look) She's possessed.  GILES Possessed by what?  WILLOW (excitedly) A possessing thing!  GILES Well, that narrows it down.  XANDER You're the expert. Maybe when the  Master killed her, some mystical bad  guy transference happened.  WILLOW That's what it was. (aside, to Xander) Why else would she be acting like  such a B. I. T. C. H.?  GILES Willow, we're all a little old to be spelling things out.  XANDER (working it out) A bitkha?  GILES I suggest the explanation for her behavior  may be somewhat more mundane.
XANDER: That's a very interesting point about  trout! That you made just now.  GILES (confused) Trout? (sees Buffy) Trout! Yes! The trout... is a fish. Good  morning! Did you sleep well?  BUFFY Like a rock. The Master's gone.  GILES I'm sorry?  BUFFY The Master. I went by his grave last night and they have a vacancy.  GILES Good god.  WILLOW What would somebody want with  Master bones?  XANDER Trophy? Horrible conversation piece?  BUFFY They're gonna bring him back.
GILES: Buffy, I've never heard of a revivification  ritual being successful --  BUFFY But you've heard of them. Thanks for  the warning.  WILLOW Buffy, Giles did bury him in hallowed --  BUFFY This is Slayer stuff, okay? Can we  have less from the civilians, please?  XANDER (truly pissed) Okay, that's just about --
SNYDER: I believe that some of us have classes. (to Giles) And some of us have jobs.  GILES (to the kids) I'll see you all in the library after school.  And we can finish our discussion.  WILLOW About trout.
SNYDER: There's some things I can just <b>smell</b>.  It's like a sixth sense.  GILES No, actually, that would be one of the five.  MR SNYDER The Summers girl? I smell trouble. I  smell expulsion. And just the faintest  aroma of jail.
GILES: Well, before you throw away the key,  perhaps you'd consider giving her the  benefit of the doubt. She may surprise  you.
SNYDER: You really have faith in those kids, don't you?  GILES Yes, I do.  MR SNYDER Weird. 
GILES: All right, I've got something. It's latin,  so bear with me. Um, to revive the  vampire, they need his bones, (sheepishly looks at Buffy) which they have... and, uh, the blood...  this is very unclear... of the closest  person, someone connected to the vampire.  BUFFY That'd be me.  GILES Perhaps...  BUFFY We were very close. Way close. We  killed each other, okay? It really  promotes togetherness.
XANDER: Well, is there anything on WHEN  the ceremony might take --
BUFFY: This is Cordelia's.
XANDER: They're gonna cook her dinner? (gets it) Please pretend I didn't ask that.  WILLOW What do we do?  BUFFY I go to the Bronze and save the day.  XANDER I don't like this.  GILES Nor I.  BUFFY Well, you guys aren't going.  WILLOW What do you mean?  BUFFY I can't be looking out for you three  while I'm fighting.  WILLOW What about the rest of the note?  BUFFY (looking it over) What rest?
WILLOW: The part where it says, 'PS this is a trap'?  GILES You'll be playing right into their hands.  BUFFY And their hands are gonna get slapped.  XANDER We should at least go in force. Stock  up stakes.  BUFFY I can handle it.  WILLOW Stop saying that! God, what's wrong  with you?  XANDER Cordelia may be dead.
BUFFY: This is my fight.
BUFFY: You know, being stalked isn't really  a big turn-on for girls.  ANGEL You need help. Someone to watch your back.  BUFFY You sure you don't mean my neck?  ANGEL Why are you riding me?
BUFFY: Because I don't trust you. You're a  vampire. Or is that an offensive term?  Should I say 'undead American'?  ANGEL You have to trust someone. You can't  do this alone.  BUFFY I trust me.  ANGEL You're not as strong as you think.  BUFFY You think you could take me?  ANGEL What?  BUFFY Come on, you must have wondered...  a vampire, the Slayer, I know you've  thought about it. If it came down to a  fight... could you take me? Why don't  we find out?  ANGEL I'm not gonna fight you.  BUFFY No? Big strong vampire like yourself?  ANGEL Buffy...  BUFFY Come on. Kick my ass.
ANGEL: Don't you have somewhere to be?
BUFFY: I do.  ANGEL Well, you're wasting time.
BUFFY: Just stay out of my way.  ANGEL Happy to oblige.
BUFFY: That's not Cordelia.
TARA: Cordelia... she didn't come...  BUFFY Where is she?
TARA: I'm not supposed to tell...  ANGEL I don't like this.  BUFFY What?  ANGEL There's the bait. Where's the hook?
BUFFY: You're right. Why would they send just one?
WILLOW: I still think we should have gone with her.  XANDER Buffy's about to lose it. I think we  should be trying to reach minimum  safe distance.  WILLOW Xander, you know it was a trap!  GILES Aha! This Latin is translated from the  Sumerian, and rather badly, which  makes it difficult. But the person  closest to the Master actually translates  as the nearest -- physically. The person  or persons who...
WILLOW: When what?
GILES: It IS a trap...
BUFFY: Watch her. Don't kill her if you don't have to.  ANGEL Buffy, what's going on?  BUFFY I'll be back.
BUFFY: Xander?
XANDER: Vampires. The ones you could handle  yourself.  BUFFY Where did they take Giles and --  XANDER I don't know! I don't know what your  problem is -- what your 'issues' are,  and as of now I officially don't care!  If you'd worked with us for five seconds  you could have stopped this.
BUFFY: We have to think. Why did they take them?  XANDER If they hurt Willow I'm gonna kill you.  BUFFY (realizes) Why did they take them and not you?
XANDER: Giles said the ritual was, um... they  needed people close to the Master...  physically close, when he...  BUFFY The ones who were with him when he  died.  XANDER Giles, Willow... Cordelia.  BUFFY (nodding) And Ms. Calendar.  XANDER Odds are, they've got the complete  set by now.  BUFFY We just have to find out where.  XANDER How?
BUFFY: One more time.
TARA: You're too late. Your friends are dead.  BUFFY Tell me where they are.  TARA What are you gonna do, kill me?  BUFFY As a matter of fact, yes.
BUFFY: So. One more time.
CORDELIA: Please... go away... what do you --
ANGEL: Buffy. Buffy!
XANDER: We gotta do something <b>now</b>.   BUFFY You two get the others out of here.  ANGEL We'll need you to distract the vampires.  BUFFY Right.
XANDER: What are you gonna do?
BUFFY: I'm gonna kill them all. (walking away) That oughta distract them.
ABSALOM: For the Old Ones, for his pain. For  the Dark.
BOB: For the Dark.
JANE: For the Dark.
WALT: For the -- GYEHNNNNGH!
ABSALOM: The sacrifices! Stop them!
GILES: Are you all right?
JENNY: I think so. My head...  GILES (to Xander) Where's Buffy?
XANDER: She's working out her issues.
ABSALOM: Your day is done, girl. I'll grind you  into a sticky paste. And I'll hear you  beg before I smash in your face.
BUFFY: So, are you gonna kill me? Or are you  just making small talk?
WILLOW: It's over.  XANDER No, it's not.
ANGEL: It's okay... it's okay...
CORDELIA: What an ordeal. And you know the worst  part: It stays with you forever. No matter  what they tell you, none of that rust and  blood and grime comes out. You can  dry-clean till judgment day; you're  living with those stains.  JENNY (dead pan) Yes. That's the worst part of being  hung upside down by a vampire that  wants to slit your throat. The stains.  CORDELIA I hear you.
BUFFY: I don't think I can face them.  GILES Of course you can.  BUFFY I can't! What am I gonna say? 'Sorry  I almost got your throats cut. What's  the homework?'  GILES Punishing yourself like this is pointless.  BUFFY It's entirely pointy! I was a moron. I  put my best friends in mortal danger -  on the second day of school!  GILES What are you going to do, crawl into  a dark cave for the rest of your life?  BUFFY Would it have cable?
GILES: Buffy, you acted wrongly, I admit, but  believe me, that was hardly the worst  mistake you'll ever make. (a beat) That wasn't nearly as comforting as it  was meant to be.  BUFFY Well, points for effort. I'll see you.
WILLOW: Buffy.  BUFFY Hey.  WILLOW We saved you a seat...
XANDER: There's a rumor going around that Mr.  Cox is the most boring teacher in the  entire world. Like I think he won a belt  or something.  BUFFY Lucky us.  WILLOW Well, I hear he nods off a lot, so that's  a plus.  XANDER So, are we bronzing tonight?  WILLOW Wednesdays it's kind of beat.  XANDER Well, we could grind our enemies into  talcum powder with a sledgehammer,  but, gosh, we did that <b>last</b> night.
ONE: I hate that girl...
