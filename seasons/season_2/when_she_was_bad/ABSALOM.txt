We have been put down, my kinsmen.  We have lost our way, and we have lost  the night. But despair is for the living.  Where they are weak, we will be strong.  Where they weep, we rejoice. Where  they bleed, we drink. Within these three  days a new hope shall rise. We put our  faith in <b>him</b>...
Dig. All of you. We have to hurry. 
For the Old Ones, for his pain. For  the Dark.
The sacrifices! Stop them!
Your day is done, girl. I'll grind you  into a sticky paste. And I'll hear you  beg before I smash in your face.
