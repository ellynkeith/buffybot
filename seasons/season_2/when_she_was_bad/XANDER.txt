Do I really have to dignify that with a guess?  WILLOW I didn't think of anything. It's a dumb game anyway. 
You got something better to do? We played  rock-paper-scissors long enough, okay?  My hand cramped up.  WILLOW Well, sure, if you're ALWAYS scissors,  of course your tendons are gonna stretch --  XANDER (interrupting) You know, I gotta say, this has really  been the most boring summer ever.  WILLOW Yeah, but on the plus side, no monsters  or stuff.
I know, but I'm so restless! I'm actually  glad school is starting again.  WILLOW Yeah, and that has nothing to do with a  certain girl that we both know that is a  vampire slayer?
Please. I'm so over her. (REAL casual) Did she, uh, say when she was getting  back, about which I don't care?  WILLOW I haven't heard from her. I mean, I got a  couple of postcards after she went to L.A.  and then, like, nothing.  XANDER Yeah, I never heard... well, she's probably  having fun with her dad.  WILLOW And you don't care.  XANDER Okay, so maybe there's some interest. I'm  a man, I have certain desires. Certain needs...  WILLOW I don't wanna know.  XANDER Don't you?
(stepping in front of her) Willow, go!  WILLOW Xander --
Well, you haven't lost your touch.  That vampire --  BUFFY I did kind of wail on him, didn't I?  XANDER I really like your hair.  BUFFY So, how did you guys fare? Did you  have any fun without me?
No.
No.
Man, I'm really glad you're back.  BUFFY Yeah. (unconvincingly, as she looks at the tree) Me too. 
Buffy. Buffy! 
Dreams are meaningful.  WILLOW They sure are. The other night I dreamt  that Xander-- (stops herself) Uh, it wasn't Xander. In fact, it wasn't me.  It was a friend's dream, and they don't  remember it.  BUFFY (smiling) I'll bet they don't.
No, Willow, they'll be clog-dancing.  WILLOW (excited) Cibo Matto can clog-dance? -- Oh,  sarcasm. Right.  XANDER (to Buffy) We should attend, no? If you're not  busy with fighting or anything.  BUFFY Sounds like fun.
You see, we can't mention that stuff  in front of other people. Buffy being  the Slayer and all.  WILLOW You haven't been talking about your  little adventure all summer, have you?  CORDELIA Are you nuts? You think I would tell  anyone that I spent the evening with  you guys? Besides, it was all so creepy.  That Master guy, screaming...
See, now that was a good insult.  WILLOW A little TOO good...
Uh, uh...
That's a very interesting point about  trout! That you made just now.  GILES (confused) Trout? (sees Buffy) Trout! Yes! The trout... is a fish. Good  morning! Did you sleep well?  BUFFY Like a rock. The Master's gone.  GILES I'm sorry?  BUFFY The Master. I went by his grave last night and they have a vacancy.  GILES Good god.  WILLOW What would somebody want with  Master bones?  XANDER Trophy? Horrible conversation piece?  BUFFY They're gonna bring him back.
Well, is there anything on WHEN  the ceremony might take --
They're gonna cook her dinner? (gets it) Please pretend I didn't ask that.  WILLOW What do we do?  BUFFY I go to the Bronze and save the day.  XANDER I don't like this.  GILES Nor I.  BUFFY Well, you guys aren't going.  WILLOW What do you mean?  BUFFY I can't be looking out for you three  while I'm fighting.  WILLOW What about the rest of the note?  BUFFY (looking it over) What rest?
Vampires. The ones you could handle  yourself.  BUFFY Where did they take Giles and --  XANDER I don't know! I don't know what your  problem is -- what your 'issues' are,  and as of now I officially don't care!  If you'd worked with us for five seconds  you could have stopped this.
Giles said the ritual was, um... they  needed people close to the Master...  physically close, when he...  BUFFY The ones who were with him when he  died.  XANDER Giles, Willow... Cordelia.  BUFFY (nodding) And Ms. Calendar.  XANDER Odds are, they've got the complete  set by now.  BUFFY We just have to find out where.  XANDER How?
We gotta do something <b>now</b>.   BUFFY You two get the others out of here.  ANGEL We'll need you to distract the vampires.  BUFFY Right.
What are you gonna do?
She's working out her issues.
There's a rumor going around that Mr.  Cox is the most boring teacher in the  entire world. Like I think he won a belt  or something.  BUFFY Lucky us.  WILLOW Well, I hear he nods off a lot, so that's  a plus.  XANDER So, are we bronzing tonight?  WILLOW Wednesdays it's kind of beat.  XANDER Well, we could grind our enemies into  talcum powder with a sledgehammer,  but, gosh, we did that <b>last</b> night.
