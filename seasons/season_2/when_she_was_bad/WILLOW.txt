Okay, hold on...  XANDER It's your turn.  WILLOW Okay, Um... "In the few hours that we  had together, we loved a lifetimes worth."  XANDER <u>Terminator</u>.  WILLOW Good. Right.  XANDER Okay. Let's see... (Charlton Heston) 'It's a madhouse! A m--  WILLOW <u>Planet of the Apes</u>.  XANDER Can I finish, please?  WILLOW Sorry. Go ahead.   XANDER 'Madhouse!'
<u>Planet of the Apes</u>. Good. Me now. Um...  XANDER Well?  WILLOW I'm thinking. Okay. 'Use the force, Luke.' 
Xander...  XANDER Come on. (dabs again) You're Amish, you won't fight back  because you're Amish, I mock you  with my ice cream cone, Amish Guy...  WILLOW <u>Witness</u>. My nose is cold.  XANDER Let me get that --
Xander!  XANDER What can I say? It makes your nose look  tasty. 
Buffy!  BUFFY Hey, Will.  XANDER Man, your timing really doesn't suck.  WILLOW When did you get back?  BUFFY Just now. Dad drove me down. And I  knew you losers would be getting into  some kind of trouble.   WILLOW I think we had the upper hand. In a  subtle way.  BUFFY Does either of you even have a cross?  Very sloppy...  XANDER Well, it's been a slow summer. That was  the first vampire we've seen since you  killed the Master.  BUFFY It's like they knew I was coming back.  XANDER What about you? How was your summer?  Did you slay anything? 
Yes.
That's right, you missed it! Right out  by that tree.
Giles buried the bones and we poured holy  water and chanted and we got to wear robes!  XANDER Very intense. You shoulda been.  WILLOW Have you see Giles? 
Giles!  XANDER Hey. G-man! What's up?  GILES Nice to see you and don't ever call  me that.  JENNY Hey, kids.  GILES (to Buffy) How are you?  BUFFY Alive and kicking.  WILLOW Buffy killed a vampire last night!  
We better get to class.  The three kids start off.  GILES Buffy. (she stops, turns) I realize you've only just returned,  but when you're ready, I think we  should start your training again.  BUFFY I'm ready. I'll see you after school.  GILES Well, I understand if you need a few  days to --  BUFFY I'm ready. 
What'd you do last night?  BUFFY Slept.
Angel came by? Wow. Was there,  I mean, was it having to do with  kissing?  BUFFY Willow, grow up. Not everything is  about kissing.  XANDER Yeah! Some stuff is about groping. (to Buffy, worried) It wasn't about groping?  BUFFY Hello, Hormones on Parade... it was  pure shop talk. You know, vampires?  Ring a bell? Pointy teeth, they walk  by night...  WILLOW What'd he say?  BUFFY (shrugs) Something's up. Nothing I can't handle.  XANDER Oh! Hey! Did you guys know? Cibo  Matto is gonna be at The Bronze tonight  WILLOW Cibo Matto? They're playing?
Yes! Our own personal demons!  XANDER Such as lust... and, uh... thrift.
I just think something's up, is all.  XANDER Willow, you're paranoid.  WILLOW Buffy's never acted like this before.  Ever since she got back, she's different.  XANDER Buffy's always been different.  WILLOW She's never been mean.  XANDER (cranes to look for her) Any sign of her? She said she was coming.  WILLOW No... The band's cool though.  XANDER (distracted) Yeah. Cool.
What's wrong with Angel?  BUFFY Beats me.
The part where it says, 'PS this is a trap'?  GILES You'll be playing right into their hands.  BUFFY And their hands are gonna get slapped.  XANDER We should at least go in force. Stock  up stakes.  BUFFY I can handle it.  WILLOW Stop saying that! God, what's wrong  with you?  XANDER Cordelia may be dead.
I still think we should have gone with her.  XANDER Buffy's about to lose it. I think we  should be trying to reach minimum  safe distance.  WILLOW Xander, you know it was a trap!  GILES Aha! This Latin is translated from the  Sumerian, and rather badly, which  makes it difficult. But the person  closest to the Master actually translates  as the nearest -- physically. The person  or persons who...
When what?
It's over.  XANDER No, it's not.
Buffy.  BUFFY Hey.  WILLOW We saved you a seat...
