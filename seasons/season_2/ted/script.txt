XANDER: You don't know what you're talking about.
WILLOW: Xander, he was obviously in charge.
XANDER: He was a puppet! She was using him.
WILLOW: He didn't seem like the type to let himself be used.
XANDER: Well, that was her genius. He never even knew he was playing second fiddle. Buffy.
BUFFY: Huh?
XANDER: Who do you think was the real power -- the Captain or Tenille?
BUFFY: Um... who are those people?
XANDER: The Captain and Tenille! (off her blank look) Boy, somebody was raised in a culture-free environment.
BUFFY: I'm sorry, I was just --
WILLOW: Thinking?
BUFFY: Not thinking. Just having a lot of happy nonthoughts. I love it when things are quiet around here.
XANDER: Yeah, with Spike and Drusilla out of the way we've really been riding the mellow and am I like jinxing the hell out of us by saying that?
BUFFY: We'll let you off this time.
WILLOW: So we're pretty sure there aren't any more Tarakan assassins coming our way?
BUFFY: Angel's sources say the contract is off.
XANDER: How is Angel? Pretend I care.
BUFFY: He's getting better.
WILLOW: And you're loving playing nursemaid.
BUFFY: Oh yeah.
XANDER: So it's better than playing naughty stewardess?
BUFFY: Xander...
WILLOW: I'm just saying, if Tenille was in charge, she would have had the little captain hat.
BUFFY: Wait here.
BUFFY: Get the hell away from my --
JOYCE: I broke a wine glass. So, you're home early...
TED: Hi.
BUFFY: Hi.
JOYCE: Oh, uh, this is my daughter, Buffy. And Buffy, this is... this is Ted.
BUFFY: So all these late nights at the gallery, I gather you were cataloguing more than art.
JOYCE: Well... I've been looking for the right moment to introduce you two. He's a wonderful man.
BUFFY: How'd you meet?
JOYCE: He sells computer software, he revamped my entire system at the gallery. Freed up a lot of my time.
BUFFY: To meet new people. And smootch them in my kitchen.
JOYCE: You weren't supposed to see that. 
WILLOW: I like my new nine-gig hard drive...
TED: But you don't love it, cause without the DMA upgrades your computer's really only half a rocket ship.
WILLOW: Yeah. But who can afford the upgrades?
TED: You can. I get the demos for free. I don't see why I shouldn't give them to you for the same price. (hands her his card) Any friend of Buffy's...
XANDER: (mouth full of pizza) That's the sound she makes when she's speechless with geeker joy. Can I just say this is the finest pizza ever on God's green earth. What's your secret?
TED: After you bake it you fry it in herbs and olive oil. And you gotta use a cast iron skillet. No room for compromise there.
XANDER: You gotta market these. I mean people would pay like two, three hundred dollars apiece.
TED: (to Buffy) Hungry?
BUFFY: No thanks.
TED: Buffy I want to apologize. That wasn't how I wanted us to met. I wanted it to be... perfect. I'm very fond of your mother, I guess that's pretty obvious...
JOYCE: I really want you to be okay with this, Buffy.
BUFFY: I'm okay.
JOYCE: You are?
BUFFY: I am.
GILES: Uh, Buffy... I believe he's... (that must have hurt) ...ahhh... it's staking time, really. Don't you think?
BUFFY: (looking around) Any others?
GILES: For their sakes I certainly hope not.
BUFFY: What? I kill vampires, that's my job.
GILES: True, although usually you don't beat them to quite such a bloody pulp beforehand. Everything all right?
BUFFY: Everything's fine. (looking around) I killed one here Wednesday, why are they hanging at the park?
GILES: They're scattered, you know. Their leaders are gone and with any luck dead. In times of crisis they will always return to the easiest feeding grounds. 
BUFFY: (grouchy) Vampires are creeps.
GILES: (duh) Yes, that's why one slays them.
BUFFY: People are perfectly happy, getting along, then vampires come in and they run around and they kill people and they take over your whole house and they make these stupid little pizzas and everyone's like "ooh, wow"...
GILES: Uh, Buffy, I believe the subtext here is rapidly becoming text. Are you sure there's nothing you wish to share with me?
BUFFY: Forget about it. I'm fine. (hopefully) You think there'll be any more vampires? I can wait...
BUFFY: Xander, if you say one more word about it, things will become dire.
XANDER: Did you eve bother to taste 'em? Noooo. Well I did and I'm here to tell you, those mini pizzas have changed my life. Ted is the master chef.
BUFFY: So? He's a great cook. What does that tell you about a person?
XANDER: Everything.
WILLOW: You don't like him.
BUFFY: I don't know him. (with disdain) I mean so far all I see is someone who apparently has a good job, seems nice and polite, my mom really likes him...
XANDER: (all dramatical) What kind of monster is he!?
BUFFY: I'm telling you, there's just something a little too clean about this clown.
WILLOW: (amused) He's a clean clown! (off their looks) I have my own fun...
XANDER: Buff, you're lacking evidence. I think we're maybe into Sigmund Freud territory.
WILLOW: He has a point. Separation anxiety, the mother figure being taken away, conflict with the father figure...
BUFFY: He's not my father figure!
XANDER: Having issues much?
BUFFY: I am not!
XANDER: You've got parental issues, you've got parental issues.
WILLOW: Xander...
XANDER: Freud would have said the exact same thing. Except he might not have done the little dance.
BUFFY: I admit it's weird -- seeing my mother frenching a guy is definitely a ticket to therapyland. But it's more than that. I'm pretty good at sensing what's going on around me...
XANDER: Ted!
BUFFY: Yeah, Ted. Who did you think I was --
XANDER: Hi, Ted! Ted who's here.
TED: Hello, kids.
BUFFY: What are you doing here?
TED: I'm updating the software in the guidance office -- which reminds me...
WILLOW: Ohh, what a day! Thank you.
TED: Think nothing of it. Buffy, you like miniature golf?
XANDER: Who doesn't?
TED: Your mother and I were thinking, maybe this Saturday we could drag the three of you out to the course? Spend some time swinging the iron with the stuffy old people?
BUFFY: Well, I guess...
TED: I'm making a picnic basic...
XANDER: Mini-pizzas?
TED: And cookies.
BUFFY: You know, I wish we could but Saturday we have that thing.
WILLOW: Oh, that thing. (to Xander) That thing.
XANDER: Hey, we can do that thing anytime. I'm tired of that thing. We're on!
GILES: Hello, Jenny.
JENNY: Rupert. Hi.
GILES: A couple crates of your textbooks were dropped off at the library. Do you want me to hold on to them?
JENNY: Yeah, that's fine. I'll send the kids by to pick them up.
GILES: Right. Good.
JENNY: That was a pretty flimsy excuse for coming to see me.
GILES: (stops) You should hear the ones I threw out.
JENNY: I'm doing pretty good, actually. I've stayed out of mortal danger for three whole weeks. I could get used to it. Still don't sleep too well, though.
GILES: Of course. Well, you need time.
JENNY: Or possibly space. Rupert, I know you're concerned, but having you constantly poking around making puppy dog eyes at me and wondering if I'm okay... you make me feel bad that I don't feel better. I don't want that responsibility.
GILES: I'm sorry. I certainly don't mean to make dog eyes at you. I'm just--
JENNY: Worried, I know.
GILES: I shouldn't have bothered you.
BUFFY: So Mom's like, "Do you think Ted will like this" and, "That's Ted's favorite show," and "Ted's teaching me computers" and "Ted said the funniest thing," and I'm like, "That's great, Mom". And then she said I was being sarcastic, which I was, but I'm sorry if I don't want to talk about Ted all the time.
ANGEL: So you'll be talking about something else at some point?
BUFFY: I'm sorry. It's just, I have so much to deal with, I don't need some new guy in my life right now.
ANGEL: No, but maybe your mom does.
BUFFY: Oh, sure, if you're gonna use wisdom...
ANGEL: (smiles) Loneliness is about the scariest thing there is.
BUFFY: Okay, fine, so Mom needs a guy. Why does it have to be Ted?
ANGEL: You have somebody else in mind? There's a guy out there that would satisfy you?
BUFFY: Well... Dad... Okay, that's not gonna happen. Reality check. I'll give Ted a chance. I'll play mini golf. I'll smile and curtsey and be the dutiful daughter. (beat) Do I have to like him?
ANGEL: Kiss me.
BUFFY: Oh, finally something I wanna do.
XANDER: The dreaded par five cuckoo clock. So many came, so few conquered.
JOYCE: That picnic was delicious. You know how rare it is to find a man who cooks?
TED: I know I've been looking a long time for one.
BUFFY: Not really.
WILLOW: Oh they are but she's only interested in... uh... her studies. Book-cracker Buffy, it's kind of her nick name.
TED: Glad to hear that. I bet that means your grades'll be picking up soon.
BUFFY: My grades?
JOYCE: I told him. He wants to know all about you. He's concerned, that's a good thing. (sees Ted shoot) Nice shot, Ted!
TED: Thanks, Joycee.
JOYCE: Thanks to you.
TED: Eye on the ball... watch those elbows...
JOYCE: We won't count it.
TED: We won't?
JOYCE: Well, it's just miniature golf.
TED: It is, but the rules are the rules. What we teach her is what she takes into the world when we're not there, whether it's at school or an unchaperoned party...
JOYCE: He has a point...
BUFFY: (not what she wanted to hear) Yah. I'll just go hit from the rough.
BUFFY: Okay, so fine my score or whatever...
TED: I think you're missing the point here, little lady...
BUFFY: It's just a game.
TED: Right. It's just a game. Do your own thing...
BUFFY: Then I guess it's a good thing I'm not in your house.
TED: Do you want me to slap that smart ass mouth of yours?
XANDER: Yum, me!
WILLOW: Cookies.
TED: I made too many, so you guys are gonna have to take some home...
JOYCE: Oh, you have to try one of these, Buffy, they're really good.
JOYCE: Good morning sunshine.
BUFFY: Hi.
JOYCE: I've got juice. I've got sticky buns. Don't they smell good?
BUFFY: I'd just like to eat something around here that Ted didn't make.
JOYCE: What kind of attitude is that?
BUFFY: Look, Mom, I know you think he's great and all but --
JOYCE: He's gone out of his way to be nice to you and you couldn't find two words to say to him on Saturday. Now I don't expect you to love him right away like I do, but I do expect you to treat him decently.
BUFFY: You... love him?
JOYCE: (beat) I don't know, that kind of slipped out... but I guess... it's not exactly like men beat down the door when you're a...
BUFFY: ...single parent.
JOYCE: I would never have anything to do with anyone who didn't care about you. But he does, I don't understand why you can't see that.
BUFFY: He threatened me.
JOYCE: What?
BUFFY: He said he was going to slap my face.
JOYCE: He never said any such thing. Ted told me what happened. He caught you cheating, didn't he.
BUFFY: Yes. I kicked my ball in, so put me in jail, but he wigged--
JOYCE: He didn't say anything about it in front of the others, did he.
BUFFY: No, but--
JOYCE: I think that was pretty decent of him.
BUFFY: I mean, investigate him. Find out his secrets. You can do it, Will. Hack into his... Life.
XANDER: Can you say, 'over-reaction'?
BUFFY: Can you say, 'sucking chest wound'?
WILLOW: Buffy, it just seems like you want him to be corrupt or something.
BUFFY: The man lost his sense over mini golf.
XANDER: So he's uptight. Last I heard, that wasn't a slaying offense. (off her look) Don't give me the look. I'm on your side. I'm just saying there are some things you have to accept.
BUFFY: And I'm saying Ted ain't one of 'em.
XANDER: Hey, Cordy. Nice outfit.
CORDELIA: (stopping) Oh, very funny.
XANDER: Not really...
CORDELIA: What are you saying?
XANDER: "Nice outfit".
CORDELIA: Why don't you just keep your mouth shut?
XANDER: Would you guys excuse me for a second?
WILLOW: What's up with them?
CORDELIA: What's wrong with you?
XANDER: I gave you a compliment.
CORDELIA: In front of your friends! They're gonna know!
XANDER: They're gonna know what?
CORDELIA: Please. It's too traumatic for me even to say it.
XANDER: That we kissed?
CORDELIA: Gnegh!
XANDER: I'm not gonna tell them and they're not gonna know. Not your friends, not my friends. You wanna go in the utility closet and make out?
CORDELIA: (furious) God! Is that all you ever thinking about?
BUFFY: Willow, I'm not wrong here. Ted has a problem with me. He acts like I'm in the way. And Mom's totally different since he's been around.
WILLOW: Different like happy?
BUFFY: Like Stepford. Will you help me?
WILLOW: You know I will. What do you want me to look for?
BUFFY: Let's start small. Where does he work?
NEAL: (on phone) ...it's a fantastic product, no p.c. should be without it... yes, it's a little pricey but... no, I don't think you're a feeble-minded moron... thanks for your time...
TED: (on phone) No Mrs. Lawndale, it's not an inexpensive piece of software. As a matter of fact it's a very expensive one. Which removes the risk of crashing your whole system. Of course if you prefer something cheap I can recommend... (smiles) ...trust me, you won't be sorry.
BUFFY: Oh, uh...
NEAL: I'm Neal.
BUFFY: I'm Bu-linda. Just temping for the day. (re: tote board) That guy's a salesman. Guess he's the one to beat around here.
NEAL: Nobody beats the machine. The guy's a genius. Pure salesman. Knows everything about computers, never loses a client, never yells at the annoying clients... not that I do...
BUFFY: I guess he's been doing this for a while.
NEAL: He was here way before me - and he'll be here long after I'm gone. If I sound bitter, I am.
BUFFY: Nobody likes an overachiever. Well, maybe he's got ex-wives and family to support.
NEAL: All he's got is a girlfriend. I'm amazed he let her clutter up his desk.
BUFFY: (evenly) The wedding?
NEAL: He's got it set for two months from now. Believe me, I'm counting the days. (sees:) Uh oh, the uber-boss, back to the salt mines.
TED: ...we ask that you bless this home and help those in it to be more productive, more considerate and... (makes eye contact with buffy) ...more honest. Amen.
JOYCE: Amen.
TED: Another great day at work. How was school, Buffy? Did ya' learn anything?
BUFFY: Quite a bit.
TED: Good for you. (re: food) Well Joycee, what do ya' think?
JOYCE: I think every home should have someone like you. It's fantastic. (to Buffy) Don't you think?
BUFFY: It... looks pretty good.
TED: Well, you know, little lady, it's not just for looks, it's for building strong bodies. (smiles)
JOYCE: (eat some) Honey...
BUFFY: Are you guys engaged?
JOYCE: What? Goodness, no, what gave you that idea?
TED: Now Joycee, let me handle this. Your mother and I are taking things one step at a time, but if things go the way I hope someday soon I just might ask her to tie the knot. How would you feel about that?
BUFFY: I'd feel like killing myself.
JOYCE: Buffy!
TED: No, no, I told her to be honest. (to Buffy) Sweetheart, you should try and get used to me cause you know what? I'm not going anywhere.
BUFFY: May I be excused?
JOYCE: You can go to your room, young lady, that's what you can do.
TED: You don't get to be salesman of the year by giving up after a couple of rejections. She'll come around, and a little birdy's telling me it's going to be sooner rather than later.
JOYCE: Where did you come from?
TED: Straight from the factory. And we pass those savings on to you.
BUFFY: Vampires... ("here kitty") Here, vampires...
BUFFY: What are you doing?
TED: Your mother said go to your room, Buffy. I think we both know she didn't mean climb out your window and go gallivanting about town.
BUFFY: First of all, this is my room. Second of all--
TED: Yes, I have.
BUFFY: How dare you. That's my personal property. How dare you!
TED: I don't see how it's any different than you snooping around my office. Do you?
BUFFY: That's none of your business.
TED: Beg to differ, little lady. Everything you do is nothing but my business from now on.
BUFFY: You better get out of here. Now.
TED: Or what. You'll "slay" me? I'm real, I'm not some goblin you made up in your diary. The psychiatrists have a word for this kind of thing... (re: journal) ...delusional. From now on you are going to do what I say when I saw or I show this to your mother and you spend your best dating years behind the walls of a mental institution. Your mother and I are going to be happy. You're not getting in the way of that. Sleep tight.
BUFFY: That's mine and you're not leaving this room with it.
TED: Take your hand off me.
BUFFY: No.
JOYCE: Buffy! Stop it!
JOYCE: Ted... Ted!
STEIN: Ma'am, I'm Detective Stein... I'm sorry but I need to ask you a few things... Your relationship with the deceased?
JOYCE: We were... um, seeing each other.
STEIN: Can you tell me what happened?
JOYCE: He fell. Down the stairs. He fell.
STEIN: I see. Did he slip, do you know what made him fall?
BUFFY: I hit him.
BUFFY: He was in my room... we got into an argument...
STEIN: About what?
BUFFY: He... um, he'd been--
STEIN: Was this the first time you two had had an argument?
BUFFY: (after a beat) No. He threatened me. He said he would slap me...
STEIN: That was tonight?
BUFFY: No... but he had my diary and I tried to take it back and... and then he hit me.
STEIN: Where?
BUFFY: (staring at him) I don't bruise easily.
STEIN: So you've been hit before?
BUFFY: Yes...
STEIN: But Ted never hit you.
BUFFY: I told you, he--
STEIN: --Before tonight. Never hit you before tonight.
BUFFY: (more confused than angry) What do you want? I told you what happened. I didn't mean to...
STEIN: I believe you. Things got out of hand. He's a big guy.
STEIN: We're not bringing anything up against your daughter right now. She says Mr. Buchanan struck her and if that's the case... anyway we're gonna examine it further. Right now I think you should just take her home and the two of you try to get some rest.
XANDER: Buffy! Are you okay?
WILLOW: How come you're here?
BUFFY: I couldn't stay home... Mom won't even look at me.
WILLOW: What happened? Unless you don't want to talk about it...
BUFFY: We had a fight. I lost my temper, really let him have it.
WILLOW: The papers said he fell.
BUFFY: He fell. Hard.
XANDER: Well, what was he?
BUFFY: What?
XANDER: What was he? Demon? Giant bug? Some kind of dark god with the secrets of nouvelle cuisine? I mean, we are talking creature feature here, right?
WILLOW: But, I'm sure it wasn't your fault. He started it!
BUFFY: Yeah, that defense only works in six-year-old court, Will.
XANDER: Court? Are you -- are they charging you with something?
BUFFY: I don't know. Not yet. But... He was a guy. He was a weird, sleazy guy but he was a person and I killed him.
WILLOW: Don't say that.
BUFFY: Why not? Everyone else is. And it's the truth.
XANDER: It was an accident.
BUFFY: I'm the Slayer. I had no right to hit him like that.
XANDER: Look, I don't know what happened exactly, but I know you. You would never hurt anyone intentionally. You know, unless--
BUFFY: Unless what? They're dating my Mom? (stands) I'm sorry, guys, I gotta be alone for a while. I'll, um, I'll just...
GILES: Buffy. Are you all right?
BUFFY: What's going on?
GILES: You needn't worry about it.
XANDER: Man, this is killing me! That bastard was up to something. I know it. If I could get my hands on him... earlier this week...
CORDELIA: I thought you liked him.
XANDER: (pointedly) I sometimes like things that are not good for me. Besides, no way no how does Buffy put the big hurt on an innocent man. Nice Uncle Ted was dirty.
WILLOW: We gotta prove that somehow. Xander, you got a pen?
XANDER: If Buffy has to go to jail because of that creep, I'm gonna lose it. He's gotta be in there, Will. History of domestic violence, criminal record... ooh, cookies.
CORDELIA: I don't get it. Buffy's the Slayer, shouldn't she have...
XANDER: A license to kill?
CORDELIA: Well, not for fun, but... I mean she's like this superman. Shouldn't there be different rules for her?
WILLOW: Sure, in a fascist society.
CORDELIA: Right! Why can't we have one of those?
GILES: Whatever the authorities are planning for her can't be much worse than what she's doing to herself. She took a human life. The guilt... it's pretty hard to bear and it won't go away soon.
CORDELIA: Wow, yeah... I guess you'd know since you helped raise that demon that got that guy killed that time.
GILES: Yes, do let's bring that up as often as possible.
XANDER: (eating another cookie) So, Giles, you're taking over tonight?
GILES: Buffy's in no shape to patrol. The least I can do is pick up the slack. Someone has to.
WILLOW: Giles, you shouldn't go out there without the Slayer.
GILES: Until Buffy regains her equilibrium, I'm afraid there is no Slayer.
CORDELIA: If you need help...
GILES: Buffy needs your help more than I. Continue investigating. Find out some more about Mr. Buchanan, if you can.
WILLOW: Be careful.
GILES: I will.
CORDELIA: Are you sure it's a good idea for him to go out?
WILLOW: Ted's got no criminal record I can find. Damn! The guy's like, citizen of the year!
XANDER: Don't sweat it. Everything'll be fine.
WILLOW: Don't sweat it?
XANDER: Yeah, cute buddy, we'll work it out. No worries.
CORDELIA: What happened to "This is killing me?"
XANDER: Worrying isn't gonna solve any problems.
BUFFY: Can I help?
JOYCE: It's done. I've been meaning to clean out this junk for months.
BUFFY: I didn't mean to hurt him.
JOYCE: I don't want to talk about this.
BUFFY: Mom, you have to know --
JOYCE: I can't. Not yet. Please, Buffy, just go to your room.
WILLOW: Okay...
XANDER: What do we know?
WILLOW: Apparently, the secret ingredient is not love.
XANDER: What is it, then?
WILLOW: I'm not positive, but I think it's Dematorin. It's like a tranquilizer, keeps you all mellow and compliant. And it shares a few components with ecstasy.
XANDER: This is evidence. This is real evidence that Ted was some kind of crook. Buffy's cleared! Willow, you're the best human ever. I adore you. (off her slightly skeptical look) That's the cookies talking, but you rock.
CORDELIA: Your search finally hit pay dirt. Got some personal records, marriage certificates, and an address.
XANDER: Let's check it out. Get our Slayer back on her feet before somebody else gets hurt.
JENNY: I get that reaction from men all the time.
GILES: Jenny! What are you doing here?
JENNY: I saw your car back there... I wanted to apologize.
GILES: I don't think this is a good time to --
JENNY: Please. Let me get this out. I was very harsh the other day. I know how bad you feel about putting me in danger before...
GILES: Imagine how I must feel now...
BUFFY: Mom?
BUFFY: Well, it's official. This day can't get any worse.
TED: Beg to differ...
BUFFY: You... you died...
TED: That's right, little lady. You killed me! Do we have something to say about that? Are we sorry?
BUFFY: What are you?
TED: I'm a salesman! That's what you should have remembered. No matter how you put him down--
GILES: My bag!
TED: I had to shut down for a little while to get you off my back. You should have seen the intern's face when I got up off the table. It was a hoot. Fun's over, though.
JENNY: Say good night, big guy...
GILES: AAAHHH!
JENNY: Oh god! Oh no!
VAMPIRE: TA-ha ha ha ha ha!!! Nice shot, lady.
TED: That wasn't playing fair, missy. You're gonna find--
BUFFY: How do you like... being hurt...?
TED: Don't worry about me and your mom. We're going to be very happy.
XANDER: Let's look around.
CORDELIA: I'll take the back.
XANDER: Check for cookies. (off her look) For evidence.
WILLOW: (leafing through documents) I count four marriage certificates.
XANDER: Any divorce papers?
WILLOW: Not a one.
XANDER: So either our boy was a mormon, or...
WILLOW: Whoah. 1957. Ted must have married young. Like preschool young.
CORDELIA: Nothing interesting. It doesn't look like anybody worked here, let alone lived here.
XANDER: Something's missing. This doesn't seem like Ted at all.
CORDELIA: And that rug totally doesn't go with the rest of the décor.
JOYCE: Buffy, I'm sorry, I know you--
TED: Joyce...
JOYCE: Ted? Is it really... but you were...
TED: I'm okay. I'm okay...
JOYCE: I don't understand this. You were dead.
TED: They said I must have been dead for six minutes. They said any longer and there would have been brain damage.
JOYCE: Why didn't anyone tell us?
TED: Nobody knew! They took me to the morgue and I was unconscious for almost a day! An intern found me. It's a miracle, Joyce. A miracle.
JOYCE: Oh, Ted...
TED: I know...
JOYCE: Oh my god, Buffy... Ted, I swear she never meant to hurt you, you have to believe me.
TED: You don't have to worry about Buffy. You don't have to worry about anything. Daddy's here.
CORDELIA: Feels just like home, if it's the 50's and you're a psycho.
XANDER: Whatdya got in the closet, Ted?
CORDELIA: We need evidence --
XANDER: We got it.
WILLOW: What's in there?
XANDER: His first four wives.
TED: You know what brought me back, Joyce? It was you. I couldn't go into that light -- I had to come back for you. I'm gonna make you so happy...
JOYCE: You should sit down...
TED: I feel fine. Never better.
JOYCE: Ted, I think I should talk to Buffy first, before she sees you. I know she'll want to--
TED: (a little strident) Do we have to worry about Buffy right now? How about worrying about Teddy, he's the one that died.
JOYCE: I'm sorry, I'm just... I don't know what to do.
TED: (softly, taking her hands) Don't I always tell you what to do? I'm gonna make this right, and then you and I--
JOYCE: Ted, I think you might want to rest for a while...
TED: I think you might want to stop telling me what to do. I don't take orders from women. I'm not wired that way.
JENNY: Oh, god, I'm so sorry...
GILES: I think I'm all right.
JENNY: You're just in shock--
GILES: No, really. It didn't go in that deep. The advantages of layers of tweed, I guess. Better than kevlar.
JENNY: We've still got to get you to a hospital.
GILES: Yes.
JENNY: Some night, huh? You sure know how to woo a girl back, don't you.
GILES: (cracks up too) Heh heh--owwwwww.
JENNY: Hospital.
JOYCE: I think I could use a drink. To celebrate.
TED: We should probably be hitting the road.
JOYCE: Hitting the road?
TED: You're gonna love the house. It's furnished just the way you like it. I spent a lot of -- (spark) --telling me what to do! (normal) --time decorating.
JOYCE: Well, then, I'd probably better pack.

WILLOW: (guilty) Not any big ones...
BUFFY: Oh, Will, you're supposed to use your powers for good!
WILLOW: I just wanna learn stuff.
CORDELIA: Like how to build your own serial killer?
XANDER: Well, it's hard to rent one nowadays.
CORDELIA: Can't we just drop the subject?
BUFFY: Absolutely. The whole incident is just something I plan to forget. I want to pick up right where we left off --
