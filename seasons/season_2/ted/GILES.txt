Uh, Buffy... I believe he's... (that must have hurt) ...ahhh... it's staking time, really. Don't you think?
For their sakes I certainly hope not.
True, although usually you don't beat them to quite such a bloody pulp beforehand. Everything all right?
They're scattered, you know. Their leaders are gone and with any luck dead. In times of crisis they will always return to the easiest feeding grounds. 
(duh) Yes, that's why one slays them.
Uh, Buffy, I believe the subtext here is rapidly becoming text. Are you sure there's nothing you wish to share with me?
Hello, Jenny.
A couple crates of your textbooks were dropped off at the library. Do you want me to hold on to them?
Right. Good.
(stops) You should hear the ones I threw out.
Of course. Well, you need time.
I'm sorry. I certainly don't mean to make dog eyes at you. I'm just--
I shouldn't have bothered you.
Buffy. Are you all right?
You needn't worry about it.
Whatever the authorities are planning for her can't be much worse than what she's doing to herself. She took a human life. The guilt... it's pretty hard to bear and it won't go away soon.
Yes, do let's bring that up as often as possible.
Buffy's in no shape to patrol. The least I can do is pick up the slack. Someone has to.
Until Buffy regains her equilibrium, I'm afraid there is no Slayer.
Buffy needs your help more than I. Continue investigating. Find out some more about Mr. Buchanan, if you can.
I will.
Jenny! What are you doing here?
I don't think this is a good time to --
Imagine how I must feel now...
My bag!
AAAHHH!
I think I'm all right.
No, really. It didn't go in that deep. The advantages of layers of tweed, I guess. Better than kevlar.
Yes.
(cracks up too) Heh heh--owwwwww.
