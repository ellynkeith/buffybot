Rupert. Hi.
Yeah, that's fine. I'll send the kids by to pick them up.
That was a pretty flimsy excuse for coming to see me.
I'm doing pretty good, actually. I've stayed out of mortal danger for three whole weeks. I could get used to it. Still don't sleep too well, though.
Or possibly space. Rupert, I know you're concerned, but having you constantly poking around making puppy dog eyes at me and wondering if I'm okay... you make me feel bad that I don't feel better. I don't want that responsibility.
Worried, I know.
I get that reaction from men all the time.
I saw your car back there... I wanted to apologize.
Please. Let me get this out. I was very harsh the other day. I know how bad you feel about putting me in danger before...
Say good night, big guy...
Oh god! Oh no!
Oh, god, I'm so sorry...
You're just in shock--
We've still got to get you to a hospital.
Some night, huh? You sure know how to woo a girl back, don't you.
Hospital.
