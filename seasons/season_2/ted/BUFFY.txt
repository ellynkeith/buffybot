Huh?
Um... who are those people?
I'm sorry, I was just --
Not thinking. Just having a lot of happy nonthoughts. I love it when things are quiet around here.
We'll let you off this time.
Angel's sources say the contract is off.
He's getting better.
Oh yeah.
Xander...
Wait here.
Get the hell away from my --
Hi.
So all these late nights at the gallery, I gather you were cataloguing more than art.
How'd you meet?
To meet new people. And smootch them in my kitchen.
No thanks.
I'm okay.
I am.
(looking around) Any others?
What? I kill vampires, that's my job.
Everything's fine. (looking around) I killed one here Wednesday, why are they hanging at the park?
(grouchy) Vampires are creeps.
People are perfectly happy, getting along, then vampires come in and they run around and they kill people and they take over your whole house and they make these stupid little pizzas and everyone's like "ooh, wow"...
Forget about it. I'm fine. (hopefully) You think there'll be any more vampires? I can wait...
Xander, if you say one more word about it, things will become dire.
So? He's a great cook. What does that tell you about a person?
I don't know him. (with disdain) I mean so far all I see is someone who apparently has a good job, seems nice and polite, my mom really likes him...
I'm telling you, there's just something a little too clean about this clown.
He's not my father figure!
I am not!
I admit it's weird -- seeing my mother frenching a guy is definitely a ticket to therapyland. But it's more than that. I'm pretty good at sensing what's going on around me...
Yeah, Ted. Who did you think I was --
What are you doing here?
Well, I guess...
You know, I wish we could but Saturday we have that thing.
So Mom's like, "Do you think Ted will like this" and, "That's Ted's favorite show," and "Ted's teaching me computers" and "Ted said the funniest thing," and I'm like, "That's great, Mom". And then she said I was being sarcastic, which I was, but I'm sorry if I don't want to talk about Ted all the time.
I'm sorry. It's just, I have so much to deal with, I don't need some new guy in my life right now.
Oh, sure, if you're gonna use wisdom...
Okay, fine, so Mom needs a guy. Why does it have to be Ted?
Well... Dad... Okay, that's not gonna happen. Reality check. I'll give Ted a chance. I'll play mini golf. I'll smile and curtsey and be the dutiful daughter. (beat) Do I have to like him?
Oh, finally something I wanna do.
Not really.
My grades?
(not what she wanted to hear) Yah. I'll just go hit from the rough.
Okay, so fine my score or whatever...
It's just a game.
Then I guess it's a good thing I'm not in your house.
Hi.
I'd just like to eat something around here that Ted didn't make.
Look, Mom, I know you think he's great and all but --
You... love him?
...single parent.
He threatened me.
He said he was going to slap my face.
Yes. I kicked my ball in, so put me in jail, but he wigged--
No, but--
I mean, investigate him. Find out his secrets. You can do it, Will. Hack into his... Life.
Can you say, 'sucking chest wound'?
The man lost his sense over mini golf.
And I'm saying Ted ain't one of 'em.
Willow, I'm not wrong here. Ted has a problem with me. He acts like I'm in the way. And Mom's totally different since he's been around.
Like Stepford. Will you help me?
Let's start small. Where does he work?
Oh, uh...
I'm Bu-linda. Just temping for the day. (re: tote board) That guy's a salesman. Guess he's the one to beat around here.
I guess he's been doing this for a while.
Nobody likes an overachiever. Well, maybe he's got ex-wives and family to support.
(evenly) The wedding?
Quite a bit.
It... looks pretty good.
Are you guys engaged?
I'd feel like killing myself.
May I be excused?
Vampires... ("here kitty") Here, vampires...
What are you doing?
First of all, this is my room. Second of all--
How dare you. That's my personal property. How dare you!
That's none of your business.
You better get out of here. Now.
That's mine and you're not leaving this room with it.
No.
I hit him.
He was in my room... we got into an argument...
He... um, he'd been--
(after a beat) No. He threatened me. He said he would slap me...
No... but he had my diary and I tried to take it back and... and then he hit me.
(staring at him) I don't bruise easily.
Yes...
I told you, he--
(more confused than angry) What do you want? I told you what happened. I didn't mean to...
I couldn't stay home... Mom won't even look at me.
We had a fight. I lost my temper, really let him have it.
He fell. Hard.
What?
Yeah, that defense only works in six-year-old court, Will.
I don't know. Not yet. But... He was a guy. He was a weird, sleazy guy but he was a person and I killed him.
Why not? Everyone else is. And it's the truth.
I'm the Slayer. I had no right to hit him like that.
Unless what? They're dating my Mom? (stands) I'm sorry, guys, I gotta be alone for a while. I'll, um, I'll just...
What's going on?
Can I help?
I didn't mean to hurt him.
Mom, you have to know --
Mom?
Well, it's official. This day can't get any worse.
You... you died...
What are you?
How do you like... being hurt...?
Uncle Teddy...
That'd be fun.
Sound like we're Themla and Louising it again.
He's not coming back, Mom.
Trust me. He's on the scrap heap. (covering) ...of life.
Willow. Tell me you didn't keep any parts.
Oh, Will, you're supposed to use your powers for good!
Absolutely. The whole incident is just something I plan to forget. I want to pick up right where we left off --
