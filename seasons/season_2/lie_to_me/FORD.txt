I'd suggest a box of Oreos dunked in  apple juice…but maybe she's over  that phase.
Hey, Summers. How you been?
I'm glad you think so. Wasn't sure  you'd remember me.
Hey.
Dad got the transfer, boom -- just  dragged me out of Hemery and put  me down here.
Well, I was a manly sixth grader,  couldn't be bothered with someone  that young.
I'm hoping you'll tell me that I am.
I'd love to, but if you guys had plans -  would I be imposing?
Okay, then. I gotta find the admissions  office, get my papers in order.
Good meeting you.
He's not in school, right? He looks  older than her.
Didn't want that soda after all?
Hi.
Whoah. Cold hands.
No, I'm actually here to stay. Just  moved down.
Uh, sure. That'd be nice.
Take care.
So, that was your boyfriend?
Sorry. So, what else do you do for  fun around here?
Uh, okay.
What's going on?
Oh. I thought you were just slaying  a vampire.
I know, Buffy. You don't have to lie.  I've been trying to figure out the right time to tell you. I know you're the Slayer.
Hey.
Went good.
Soon.
Marvin --
Diego. Ritalin. Everything's gonna be fine.
(eyes on the movie) Diego, you gotta trust me. A couple more  days and we'll get to do the two things  every American teen should have the  chance to do. Die young…
…and stay pretty.
You made quite a hit at the prom.
Wasn't dull, though. Watching the gym  go up in flames… it was like a movie.  Life isn't nearly enough like a movie,  don't you think?
You saved a lot of people's lives. I  know it - I bet there's others who do too.
You know, one minute you're a kid,  living in your safe kid world, and then -  truth hits you in the face. Vampires.  I'll never forget that night
What's with that? Nobody would say a word.
Who was that?
Morning.
Nice girl.
I know.
Well, it's really…
Okay. Dull works.
Or maybe not so dull… Is that more vampires?
Maybe they were just passing through.
You've got one chance to live. Tell  me what I want to know, and I let you go.
I killed her.  (he coughs) I killed her and she just turned to dust.  It was amazing.
This is so cool!
I would totally live here. (points to the rolly ramp) Do you ever slide down that thing?  I bet you do.
I know who you are.
I came looking for you. Spike. You are  Spike, right? William the Bloody?
That doesn't matter. I've got something  to offer you.
I'm pretty sure this is the part where  you take out a watch and say I've got  thirty seconds to convince you not to  kill me . it's traditional.
Come one. Say it. It's no fun if you  don't say it.
Yes! This is the best. I wanna be like  you. A vampire.
Well, feature this. I'm offering a trade.  You make me a vampire. And I give  you the Slayer.
Buffy!
I had a great time last night. Well,  an interesting time.
I'm probably presumptuous here but  do you want to go out again tonight?
I sort of had an idea. It's a secret -  I kind of want to surprise you.
Cool. You know that place you were  telling me about, the burger joint that  got condemned? Can you meet me there?
At nine?
It's gonna be fun.
Chantarelle. Is everything ready?
Are you nervous?
I know they will. Everything's falling  into place.
What are you talking about?
Oh, Christ. Why didn't you tell me about this?
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.
It's kind of drafty in here.
We all have flaws.
Everybody lies.
Yeah, I guess there is.
I really don't think you'd understand.
I'm gonna be one of them.
I'm going to.
I don't think I want to talk anymore
Yes.
Something like that.
(smiles)  Actually, I was counting on it.
This is so cool! This is just like it played  in my head. The part where you ask me  what's supposed to happen. It's already  happening.
Rigged it up special. Once it's closed,  it can only be opened from the outside.  As soon as the sun sets, they'll be coming.
This is the end, Buffy.
No one gets out of here alive.
This is a bomb shelter, Buffy. I knew  I wasn't gonna be able to overpower you.  But this is three feet of solid concrete.  Trust me when I say we're here for  the long haul.
It doesn't matter. There's no key, there's  no exit… let's all just sit back and relax.
You have an interesting way of relaxing.
I do what I have to.
Gotta back her up, D. You look like  a big ninny.
6:27. Sunset.
More than you think.
I guess I am. Cool.
Technically, yes. But I'm in. I will  become immortal.
It's better than nothing.
Neither do I! But apparently nobody  took that into consideration, 'cause I'm  still dying.
I look good, don't I? Let me tell you  something. I got maybe six months left  and by then what they bury won't even  look like me. It'll be bald and shriveled  and it'll smell bad. Not human. I'm not  going out that way.
I'm sorry, Summers, did I screw up your  righteous anger riff? Does the nest of tumors  liquefying my brain kind of spoil the fun?
Okay, well, you try vomiting for twenty  four hours straight because the pain your  head is so intense and then we'll discuss  the concept of right and wrong.  (indicating the others) These people are sheep. They want to  be vampires 'cause they're lonely, or  miserable, or bored. I don't have a choice.
You think I need to justify myself to you?
You know what, Summers? I really  did miss you.
What happened?
Buffy?
Hey, well, I delivered. I handed her  to you.
So what about my reward?
