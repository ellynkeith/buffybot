I can't wait.
You guys are newbies, I can tell.
Don't be ashamed. It's cool that you're  open to it. We welcome anyone who's  interested in the Lonely Ones.
So many people have that misconception.  But they who walk with the night are not  interested in harming anyone. They're  separate from humanity, and must carry  the burden of immortality. They are  creatures above us. Exalted.
You don't have to be so confrontational  about it. Other viewpoints than yours  may be valid, you know.
Is it time? Tonight?
Yes. No. I'm ready for the change.  Do you really think they'll bless us?
One was mean.
(worried) It's gonna be all right, isn't it? They're  not gonna let us down?
I need them to bless me.
We're going to ascend to a new level  of consciousness. Become like them,  like the Lonely Ones.
Why are you fighting it? It's what  we want.
This is a beautiful day! Can't you  see that?
