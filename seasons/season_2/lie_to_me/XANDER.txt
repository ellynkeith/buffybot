I think you mean "oppressed."
Who's friendly?
Hey, it's me. If Angel's doing something  wrong I need to know. 'Cause it gives  me a happy.
Aw, you just need cheering up. And  I know just the thing. (a few wild moves) Crazed dance party at the Bronze!
(restrained moves)  Very calm dance party at the Bronze. (no moves)  Moping at the Bronze.
So, you two know each other?
Hi.
(less enthused) Yeah, it's fun.
Only in the literal sense.
"This is Ford, my bestest friend of all  my friends". Jeez. Didn't she know  any fat guys?
Care to make a small wager on that?
He's Buffy's beau. Her special friend.
You're not wrong
You're not wrong.
Well, Sunnydale is a fun town to live  in. If you're a small patch of moss.
Okay, once more, with tension.
Buffy's oldest and dearest.
Yeah. And boy, does he move fast.
I'm gonna have to go with Dead Boy  on this one.
In no way do we stick out like a  sore thumb.
Sure thing, Bossy the cow.
What?
You have too many thoughts.
Okay, are we noticing a theme here?
My corset's just at the cleaners.
Oh. We usually call them the nasty  pointy bitey ones.
(to Angel) Boy, you're really a people person.
You know, I love a good diatribe, but  I'm still curious why Ford, the bestest  friend of the Slayer, is hanging with a  bunch of vampire wannabe's.
Vampires.
Did you find out what Ford is up to?
Angel was in your <u>bedroom</u>?
Come back for what?
