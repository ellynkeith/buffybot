JAMES: Come on, Mom…
JAMES: No. My Mom's supposed to pick  me up is all.
DRUSILLA: Do you want me to walk you home?
DRUSILLA: My mummy used to sing me to sleep  at night. "Run and catch, run and catch,  the lamp is caught in the blackberry patch".  She had the sweetest voice, like cherries.  What will your mummy sing when they  find your body?
JAMES: I'm not… I'm not supposed to  talk to people.
DRUSILLA: Oh, I'm not a person, so that's just--
DRUSILLA: My Angel.
DRUSILLA: (comes slowly to him) Do you remember the song mummy  used to sing me? Pretty. She would  sing me to sleep, and the fairies and  sprites would bit at my heels.
DRUSILLA: Yes…you do…
ANGEL: Drusilla, leave here. I'm offering you  that chance. Take Spike and get out.
DRUSILLA: Or you'll hurt me?
ANGEL: If you don't leave… it'll go badly.  For all of us.
DRUSILLA: My dear boy's gone all away,  hasn't he? To her.
DRUSILLA: The girl.
DRUSILLA: The Slayer. Your heart stinks of her.  Poor little thing. She has no idea  what's in store.
DRUSILLA: Oh, no, my pet…
JENNY: It's a secret.
GILES: What kind of secret?
JENNY: The kind that's secret. You know,  where I don't tell you what it is.
GILES: But I just think it's customary, if two  people are going out on an evening,  for the both of them to know where  they're going.
JENNY: Oh, come on! Where's your sense  of adventure?
GILES: But, I -- how will I know what to wear?
JENNY: (re: his tweedy look) Do you own anything else?
GILES: Not as such.
JENNY: You're just gonna have to trust me, Rupert.
GILES: All right. I put myself in your hands.
JENNY: Now that sounds like fun.
BUFFY: Hey guys.
JENNY: I gotta take off. Tomorrow, 7:30. Right?
GILES: Yes.
BUFFY: Did a couple of quick sweeps, you  know, downtown.
GILES: No encounters?
GILES: Well, I've been researching our new  friend Spike. The profile is fairly  unappetizing -- but I still haven't a  bead on why he's here.
BUFFY: You'll figure it out.
GILES: Are you all right? You seem a bit glum.
BUFFY: I'm okay.
BUFFY: That's be nice.
GILES: Yes, even I realize a young person like  yourself can't spend all her time fighting  the forces of darkness. No slaying this  evening. Perhaps you can concentrate  on your homework instead.
BUFFY: Do they know about "fun" in England?
GILES: Yes, but's considered very poor taste  to have any. Very well. Do whatever  it is you like. You could spend some  time with Angel.
BUFFY: I don't know. He might have other plans.
CORDELIA: I just don't see why everyone is always  ragging on Marie Antoinette. I can <u>so</u>
 relate to her. She worked really hard to  look that good. People don't appreciate  that effort.
XANDER: I think you mean "oppressed."
CORDELIA: Whatever. They were cranky. So they're  like, "let's lose some heads now."  Oh, that's fair. And Marie Antoinette  cared about them. She was gonna let  them have cake!
BUFFY: I don't know. I don't think so -- I mean,  they seemed pretty friendly.
XANDER: Who's friendly?
BUFFY: No one.
WILLOW: Angel and a girl.
XANDER: Hey, it's me. If Angel's doing something  wrong I need to know. 'Cause it gives  me a happy.
BUFFY: I'm glad someone has a happy.
XANDER: Aw, you just need cheering up. And  I know just the thing. (a few wild moves) Crazed dance party at the Bronze!
BUFFY: I don't know.
XANDER: (restrained moves)  Very calm dance party at the Bronze. (no moves)  Moping at the Bronze.
FORD: I'd suggest a box of Oreos dunked in  apple juice…but maybe she's over  that phase.
BUFFY: Ford?
FORD: Hey, Summers. How you been?
BUFFY: What are you doing here?
BUFFY: Huh?
BUFFY: That's great!
FORD: I'm glad you think so. Wasn't sure  you'd remember me.
BUFFY: Remember you? Duh, we were in school  together for seven years. You were my  giant fifth grade crush. Remember.
XANDER: So, you two know each other?
BUFFY: Oh! I'm sorry. This is Ford. Uh, Billy  Fordham. This is Xander and Willow.
XANDER: Hi.
FORD: Hey.
WILLOW: Nice to meet you.
BUFFY: Ford and I went to Hemery together, in L.A. (to Ford) And you're here? For real?
FORD: Dad got the transfer, boom -- just  dragged me out of Hemery and put  me down here.
BUFFY: This is great! I mean, It's hard, sudden  move, all your friends, delicate time  very emotional but let's talk about me  this is great!
WILLOW: So you guys were sweeties in fifth grade?
BUFFY: Not even. Ford wouldn't give me  the time of day.
FORD: Well, I was a manly sixth grader,  couldn't be bothered with someone  that young.
BUFFY: It was terrible. I moped over you for  months. Sitting in my room listening  to that Divinyls song, "I touch myself". (suddenly sheepish) Of course, I had no idea what it was about.
WILLOW: It's fun to meet someone who knew  Buffy from before she was the -- (off Buffy's glare) -- the here-being girl.
XANDER: (less enthused) Yeah, it's fun.
BUFFY: Hey! Are you busy tonight?
FORD: I'm hoping you'll tell me that I am.
BUFFY: We're going to the Bronze. It's the  local club and you gotta come.
FORD: I'd love to, but if you guys had plans -  would I be imposing?
XANDER: Only in the literal sense.
BUFFY: You're coming. I have spoken.
FORD: Okay, then. I gotta find the admissions  office, get my papers in order.
BUFFY: I'll walk you. See you guys in French.
FORD: Good meeting you.
XANDER: "This is Ford, my bestest friend of all  my friends". Jeez. Didn't she know  any fat guys?
WILLOW: (gets it) Oh! That's what that song's about?
BUFFY: Hey, you got here.
WILLOW: Buffy, Ford was just telling us about  the ninth grade beauty contest. And the,  uh, swimsuit competition?
BUFFY: Oh, God. Ford! Stop that! The more  people you tell about it, the more  people I have to kill.
XANDER: Care to make a small wager on that?
BUFFY: I'm gonna grab a soda. Ford, try not to talk.
ANGEL: Hey. I was hoping you'd show.
ANGEL: Yeah. I eat, too. Not for nutritional  value -- it just kind of passes the time.
BUFFY: Oh. Who knew?
ANGEL: There's a lot about me you don't know.
BUFFY: I believe that.
WILLOW: That's Angel.
XANDER: He's Buffy's beau. Her special friend.
FORD: He's not in school, right? He looks  older than her.
XANDER: You're not wrong
BUFFY: So, what'd you do last night?
ANGEL: Nothing.
BUFFY: Nothing at all? You ceased to exist?
ANGEL: No, I mean I stayed in. Read.
BUFFY: Oh.
FORD: Didn't want that soda after all?
BUFFY: Not that thirsty.
WILLOW: Hey, Angel.
FORD: Hi.
BUFFY: This is Ford. We went to school  together in L.A.
ANGEL: Nice to meet you.
FORD: Whoah. Cold hands.
XANDER: You're not wrong.
ANGEL: So, you're visiting Buffy?
FORD: No, I'm actually here to stay. Just  moved down.
XANDER: Well, Sunnydale is a fun town to live  in. If you're a small patch of moss.
WILLOW: Angel, do you want to sit?
BUFFY: It's so crowded in here. I'm hot. (to Ford) Do you want to go for a walk?
FORD: Uh, sure. That'd be nice.
BUFFY: I'll see you all tomorrow.
ANGEL: Good night.
FORD: Take care.
XANDER: Okay, once more, with tension.
CORDELIA: Who's the tasty treat?
XANDER: Buffy's oldest and dearest.
ANGEL: He just moved here?
XANDER: Yeah. And boy, does he move fast.
WILLOW: Well, Angel, you can still hang  out with us --
FORD: So, that was your boyfriend?
BUFFY: No. Well, yeah. Well, maybe. Let's  lay off the tough questions for a while.
FORD: Sorry. So, what else do you do for  fun around here?
BUFFY: Um, Uh, my purse! I left it at the Bronze.  Would you get it for me? Thanks.
FORD: Uh, okay.
BUFFY: Good. Run. Thanks.
FORD: What's going on?
BUFFY: There was a cat. A cat here and then  there was, another cat. And they fought,  the cats, and then they left.
FORD: Oh. I thought you were just slaying  a vampire.
BUFFY: What? Whatting a what?
FORD: I know, Buffy. You don't have to lie.  I've been trying to figure out the right time to tell you. I know you're the Slayer.
WILLOW: Just like that? He told you?
BUFFY: Just like that. Said he found out right  before I got booted from Hemery.
WILLOW: Wow. It's neat. Is it neat?
BUFFY: It…yeah, I guess it is . it's nice to have  someone else that I can open up to.  No more hiding.
DIEGO: Ford. Ford!
FORD: Hey.
DIEGO: Well? How did it go?
FORD: Went good.
FORD: Soon.
DIEGO: You know, you could give me a little  more information here. I'm trusting you,  I'm out on a limb here -- not to mention  the lease is almost up on this place and  who's gonna cover that, my dad's not  sending me another dime --
FORD: Marvin --
DIEGO: Diego. Come on, it's Diego now.
FORD: Diego. Ritalin. Everything's gonna be fine.
CHANTARELLE: I can't wait.
DIEGO: Well, I still think I should be in on the plan.
FORD: (eyes on the movie) Diego, you gotta trust me. A couple more  days and we'll get to do the two things  every American teen should have the  chance to do. Die young…
FORD: …and stay pretty.
PALANCE: So, you play your wits against mine.  Me, who commanded armies hundreds  of years before you were born. Fools!  There is no way in this life to stop me…
WILLOW: Oh! Angel.
WILLOW: What are you doing here?
WILLOW: Well, oh.
WILLOW: Well?
ANGEL: I can't… unless you invite me.  I can't come in.
WILLOW: Oh! Okay. Uh, I invite you. To come in.
ANGEL: If this is a bad time…
WILLOW: No, I just… I'm not supposed to have  boys in my room.
ANGEL: Well, I promise to behave myself.
WILLOW: Okay, good.
WILLOW: Help? You mean like on homework?  No, 'cause you're old and you already  know stuff.
ANGEL: I want you to track someone down.  On the net.
WILLOW: Oh! Great. I'm so the net girl.
ANGEL: I just want to find everything I can.  Records, affiliates -- I'm not even  sure what I'm looking for yet.
WILLOW: What's the name?
ANGEL: Billy Fordham.
WILLOW: Um, Angel, if I say something you  don't really wanna hear, do you  promise not to bite me?
ANGEL: Are you gonna tell me that I'm jealous?
WILLOW: Well, you do sometimes get that way.
ANGEL: You know, I never used to.
ANGEL: Things used to be pretty simple. A  hundred years just hanging out, feeling  guilty. I really honed my brooding skills.  Then she comes along… Yeah, I get  jealous. But I know people and my  gut tells me this is a wrong guy.
WILLOW: Okay, well, you've got a smart gut I  guess. But if there isn't anything weird -  hey, that's weird.
ANGEL: What?
WILLOW: I just checked the school records. He's  not in them. Usually they transfer your  grades and stuff, but… he's not even  registered.
ANGEL: He said he was in school with you  guys, right?
WILLOW: Okay, there's no Fordham listed in  Sunnydale. Curiouser and Curiouser.  Let me see if I can --
WILLOW: Ack! Go!
WILLOW: (calls out:) I'm just going to bed now, Mom.  I'm very sleepy. (to Angel) Come by at sunset tomorrow. I'll  keep looking.
ANGEL: Don't tell Buffy what we're doing, all right?
WILLOW: You want me to lie to her? It's Buffy.  Besides, I don't lie good. I lie bad.
ANGEL: Just don't bring it up 'til we know  what's what.
WILLOW: Okay. It's probably nothing.
ANGEL: That'd be nice.
BUFFY: And then everything was Vampires. I  slacked utterly in school -- and my social  life pretty much dried up and blew away.
FORD: You made quite a hit at the prom.
BUFFY: Oh, God, the prom. What a disaster.
FORD: Wasn't dull, though. Watching the gym  go up in flames… it was like a movie.  Life isn't nearly enough like a movie,  don't you think?
BUFFY: I think that was the worst night of my life.
FORD: You saved a lot of people's lives. I  know it - I bet there's others who do too.
BUFFY: It's good to hear. And it's good to be  able to talk to someone who knows.  Who knew me before, and… well. During.
FORD: You know, one minute you're a kid,  living in your safe kid world, and then -  truth hits you in the face. Vampires.  I'll never forget that night
BUFFY: Most everybody else did.
FORD: What's with that? Nobody would say a word.
BUFFY: People ignore truths they don't like.
CORDELIA: Buffy, you haven't introduced me to  your new friend.
BUFFY: Yeah, isn't that weird?
FORD: Who was that?
BUFFY: A truth I like to ignore.
BUFFY: Will! What's up?
WILLOW: Nothing.
BUFFY: You wanna hang? We were cafeteria bound.
WILLOW: I'm going to work in the computer lab.  On school work that I have. So I could  not hang just now. Hi Ford.
FORD: Morning.
BUFFY: Okay, Will. Fess up.
WILLOW: (scared) What?
BUFFY: Were you drinking coffee again?  'Cause we've talked about this.
WILLOW: Ha ha ha ha! (to Ford) It makes me jumpy. (to both) I have to go. Away.
FORD: Nice girl.
BUFFY: There aren't two of those in the world.
GILES: Buffy. Ms. Calendar and I are going…  somewhere … tonight. She's given me  her beeper number in case you need me  for any… (glances at Ford) …study help. Suddenly.
BUFFY: He knows, Giles.
GILES: What?
BUFFY: Ford. He knows I'm the Slayer.
FORD: I know.
GILES: Oh. Very good then.  (pulls Buffy aside) Buffy, you aren't by any chance giving  away your secret identity just to impress  cute boys, are you?
BUFFY: I didn't tell him. He knew.
GILES: All right. Well, remember, if you need me --
BUFFY: Go. Experience this thing called fun.  I'll try not to have a crisis.
FORD: Well, it's really…
BUFFY: Feel free to say 'dull'.
FORD: Okay. Dull works.
FORD: Or maybe not so dull… Is that more vampires?
BUFFY: Must be the weather.
BUFFY: Stick close to me.
FORD: Maybe they were just passing through.
BUFFY: I don't think so.
FORD: You've got one chance to live. Tell  me what I want to know, and I let you go.
BUFFY: Where's the other one?
FORD: I killed her.  (he coughs) I killed her and she just turned to dust.  It was amazing.
WILLOW: The only thing I could track down  were some E-mails to a guy called Diego.  And this address. The sunset Club.  I still didn't find anything incriminating.
ANGEL: He leaves no paper trail, no record.  That's incriminating enough.
XANDER: I'm gonna have to go with Dead Boy  on this one.
ANGEL: Could you not call me that?
ANGEL: We're friends of Ford's. He said we  should come by.
WILLOW: Boy, we blend right in.
XANDER: In no way do we stick out like a  sore thumb.
ANGEL: Let's look around. You guys check  out downstairs.
XANDER: Sure thing, Bossy the cow.
WILLOW: Okay, but do they really stick out?
XANDER: What?
WILLOW: Sore thumbs. Do they stick out? I mean,  have you ever seen a thumb and gone  "wow, that baby is sore".
XANDER: You have too many thoughts.
XANDER: Okay, are we noticing a theme here?
WILLOW: Like, as in, "Vampires Yay"?
CHANTARELLE: You guys are newbies, I can tell.
WILLOW: Oh, no. we come here all the time.
XANDER: My corset's just at the cleaners.
CHANTARELLE: Don't be ashamed. It's cool that you're  open to it. We welcome anyone who's  interested in the Lonely Ones.
WILLOW: The Lonely Ones?
ANGEL: Vampires.
XANDER: Oh. We usually call them the nasty  pointy bitey ones.
CHANTARELLE: So many people have that misconception.  But they who walk with the night are not  interested in harming anyone. They're  separate from humanity, and must carry  the burden of immortality. They are  creatures above us. Exalted.
ANGEL: You're a fool.
CHANTARELLE: You don't have to be so confrontational  about it. Other viewpoints than yours  may be valid, you know.
XANDER: (to Angel) Boy, you're really a people person.
WILLOW: Nobody's gonna talk to us now.
ANGEL: I've seen enough. And I've seen this type  before. They're children, making up bedtime  stories about friendly vampires to comfort  themselves in the dark.
WILLOW: Is that so bad? I mean the dark can get  pretty dark, sometimes you need a story.
ANGEL: These people don't know anything about  vampires. What they are, how they live,  how they dress…
XANDER: You know, I love a good diatribe, but  I'm still curious why Ford, the bestest  friend of the Slayer, is hanging with a  bunch of vampire wannabe's.
WILLOW: Something's up with him. (to Angel) You were right about that.
BUFFY: Sorry to beep you guys in the middle  of stuff, but this did seem a bit weird.
GILES: No, you did the right thing.
GILES: No! But -- vampires on campus -- there  could be implications… very grave…
JENNY: Why didn't you say something?
GILES: No, honestly, I've always been interested  in… monster trucks. I swear.
BUFFY: You took him to monster trucks?
JENNY: I thought it would be a change.
GILES: It was a change.
JENNY: We could have just left.
GILES: And miss the nitro burning funny cars?  Couldn't have that. Best part.
BUFFY: Okay, can we get back on the vampire  tip? These guys were here with a purpose.
GILES: And we have to figure out what that  purpose is.
JENNY: Where's your friend?
BUFFY: I sent him home.
GILES: Good. The less he's mixed up in this,  the safer he'll be.
BUFFY: Well, he did bag a vamp his first time  out. You gotta give him credit for… that…
JENNY: Something wrong?
BUFFY: Who is this?
GILES: She's called Drusilla. A sometime  paramour of Spike's.
BUFFY: Not sometime. <u>Now</u>time.
GILES: She was reported killed by an angry  mob in Prague.
BUFFY: Well, they don't make angry mobs  like they used to cuz this girl's alive.  I saw her with Angel.
GILES: With Angel?
JENNY: Isn't he supposed to be a good guy?
BUFFY: (quietly, as the implication sinks in) Yes. He is.
JENNY: I think maybe we need to read up  on this nice lady.
GILES: Some of my newer volumes might be  helpful. My own research has --
JENNY: You guys okay?
GILES: A book. It took one of my books.
JENNY: Well at least someone in this school  is reading…
BUFFY: He said he killed it.  (turns to them) That's the vampire Ford said he killed.
GILES: He lied?
BUFFY: Why?
DRUSILLA: You sing the sweetest little song.  Won't you sing for me? Don't you love  me anymore?
SPIKE: Darling, I heard a funny thing just now. Lucius told me you went out for a hunt  the other night.
DRUSILLA: (focussed on the bird) My tummy was growly. And you were out. (to the bird) Come on. I will put if you don't sing…
SPIKE: You, uh, run into anyone? Anyone  interesting? (she doesn't answer) Like Angel?
DRUSILLA: Angel.
SPIKE: Yeah. What might you guys have to  talk about then? Old times? Childhood  pranks? It's a little off, you two so friendly,  him being the enemy and all that.
DRUSILLA: (to the bird) I'll give you a seed if you sing…
SPIKE: (losing patience) The bird's dead, Dru. You left it in the  cage and you didn't feed it and now it's  all dead. Just like the last one.
SPIKE: I'm sorry, baby. I'm a bad, rude man, I  just don't like you going out. You are  weak. Would you like a new bird?  One that's not dead?
FORD: This is so cool!
FORD: I would totally live here. (points to the rolly ramp) Do you ever slide down that thing?  I bet you do.
SPIKE: Do I have anyone on watch here? It's  called security, people. Are you all asleep?
SPIKE: Or did we finally find a restaurant  that delivers.
FORD: I know who you are.
SPIKE: Yeah, I know who I am, too. So what?
FORD: I came looking for you. Spike. You are  Spike, right? William the Bloody?
SPIKE: You've got a real death wish. It's  almost interesting.
SPIKE: This is great. This will be very useful. (not looking up) So, how'd you find me?
FORD: That doesn't matter. I've got something  to offer you.
FORD: I'm pretty sure this is the part where  you take out a watch and say I've got  thirty seconds to convince you not to  kill me . it's traditional.
SPIKE: Well, I don't much go for tradition.
DRUSILLA: Wait, sweetie.
SPIKE: Well?
FORD: Come one. Say it. It's no fun if you  don't say it.
SPIKE: What? Oh. (rolls his eyes, then very flatly) You've got thirty seconds to convince  me not to kill you.
FORD: Yes! This is the best. I wanna be like  you. A vampire.
SPIKE: I've known you for two minutes and I  can't stand you. I don't really feature  you living forever. (to Dru) Can I eat him now, love?
FORD: Well, feature this. I'm offering a trade.  You make me a vampire. And I give  you the Slayer.
BUFFY: Sure. I thought once you'd been invited  you could always just walk in.
BUFFY: Oh.
ANGEL: We need to talk.
BUFFY: Do we?
ANGEL: It's about your friend Ford. He's not  what he seems.
BUFFY: Well, who is these days?
ANGEL: Willow ran him down on the computer.
BUFFY: Willow?
ANGEL: We found this address. We checked it  out with Xander and it turned out to --
BUFFY: And Xander? Wow, everybody's in.  It's a great big exciting conspiracy.
ANGEL: What are you talking about?
BUFFY: I'm talking about the people I trust.  Who's Drusilla?
BUFFY: And don't lie to me. I'm tired of it.
ANGEL: Some lies are necessary.
BUFFY: For what?
ANGEL: Sometimes the truth is worse. You live  long enough, you find that out.
BUFFY: I can take it. I can take the truth.
ANGEL: Do you love me?
BUFFY: What?
ANGEL: Do you?
BUFFY: I love you. I don't know if I trust you.
BUFFY: Maybe I'm the one should decide.
BUFFY: You made her a vampire.
ANGEL: First I made her insane. Killed everyone  she loved, visited every mental torture  on her I could devise. She eventually  fled to a convent and the day she took  her holy orders I turned her into a demon.
BUFFY: Well, I asked for the truth…
ANGEL: Ford's part of some society that reveres  vampires. Practically worships them.  I don't know what he wants from you.  But you can't trust him.
FORD: Buffy!
BUFFY: Ford.
FORD: I had a great time last night. Well,  an interesting time.
BUFFY: I'm glad.
FORD: I'm probably presumptuous here but  do you want to go out again tonight?
BUFFY: I'm not busy.
FORD: I sort of had an idea. It's a secret -  I kind of want to surprise you.
BUFFY: I like surprises.
FORD: Cool. You know that place you were  telling me about, the burger joint that  got condemned? Can you meet me there?
BUFFY: Sure.
FORD: At nine?
BUFFY: At nine.
FORD: It's gonna be fun.
CORDELIA: Come on, can't you tell me anything  about him?
WILLOW: Why are you so interested in Ford?
CORDELIA: In case you haven't noticed there is a  devastating cute guy shortage right now.  The government is calling for rationing  so why does Buffy get to hoard them all?  She has Angel. So come on, what's Ford  interested in?
XANDER: Vampires.
CORDELIA: (deflated) oh great. That's Buffy's best subject.  You sure he doesn't like clothes?
WILLOW: Hey Buffy. Did, uh, Angel -
BUFFY: He told me. Everything.
WILLOW: I'm sorry we kept stuff from you.
BUFFY: (almost means it) It's okay.
WILLOW: When Angel came to my room he was  just really concerned for you. And we  didn't want to say anything in case  we were wrong.
XANDER: Did you find out what Ford is up to?
BUFFY: I will.
XANDER: Angel was in your <u>bedroom</u>?
WILLOW: (nods) Ours is a forbidden love.
FORD: Chantarelle. Is everything ready?
DIEGO: (approaching) Of course it's ready, I took care of it.  I always take care of it.
CHANTARELLE: Is it time? Tonight?
FORD: Are you nervous?
CHANTARELLE: Yes. No. I'm ready for the change.  Do you really think they'll bless us?
FORD: I know they will. Everything's falling  into place.
DIEGO: What about your friends? Are they  coming? I don't think it's fair -- they're  not true believers.
FORD: What are you talking about?
DIEGO: Your friends. They came last night.  Two guys and a girl.
CHANTARELLE: One was mean.
DIEGO: That's not the point. They weren't even  dressed right. Plus they didn't know the  password so officially they really shouldn't  have been here.
FORD: Oh, Christ. Why didn't you tell me about this?
DIEGO: I have to do everything, okay Mister  flawless plan guy? So maybe it slipped  my mind.
CHANTARELLE: (worried) It's gonna be all right, isn't it? They're  not gonna let us down?
FORD: It's gonna be fine.
CHANTARELLE: I need them to bless me.
FORD: It's gonna be fine.
BUFFY: It's really not.
FORD: It's kind of drafty in here.
BUFFY: I'm sorry Ford, I just couldn't wait till  tonight. I'm rash and impulsive -- it's a flaw.
FORD: We all have flaws.
BUFFY: So I'm constantly learning. I'm still fuzzy  on exactly what yours is. I think it has  to do with being a lying scumbag.
FORD: Everybody lies.
BUFFY: But not everybody is a lying scumbag.  There's a difference.
FORD: Yeah, I guess there is.
BUFFY: What do you want, Ford? What's  this all about?
FORD: I really don't think you'd understand.
BUFFY: I don't need to understand. I just need  to know.
FORD: I'm gonna be one of them.
BUFFY: One of them. You want to become  a vampire.
FORD: I'm going to.
BUFFY: Vampires are kind of picky about  who they change. (realizes) So you were gonna offer them a trade.
FORD: I don't think I want to talk anymore
BUFFY: Well, I still feel kind of chatty. You were  gonna give them me. Tonight.
FORD: Yes.
BUFFY: What, lure me into the old building,  leave me there for them?
FORD: Something like that.
BUFFY: You had to know I'd figure it out, Ford.
FORD: (smiles)  Actually, I was counting on it.
BUFFY: What's supposed to happen tonight?
FORD: This is so cool! This is just like it played  in my head. The part where you ask me  what's supposed to happen. It's already  happening.
FORD: Rigged it up special. Once it's closed,  it can only be opened from the outside.  As soon as the sun sets, they'll be coming.
BUFFY: Ford, if these people are still around  when they get here --
DIEGO: We'll be changed. All of us.
CHANTARELLE: We're going to ascend to a new level  of consciousness. Become like them,  like the Lonely Ones.
FORD: This is the end, Buffy.
FORD: No one gets out of here alive.
BUFFY: There's gotta be a way out of here.
FORD: This is a bomb shelter, Buffy. I knew  I wasn't gonna be able to overpower you.  But this is three feet of solid concrete.  Trust me when I say we're here for  the long haul.
BUFFY: At least let these people out of here.
DIEGO: No way! No fair! We're a part of this,  you promised.
FORD: It doesn't matter. There's no key, there's  no exit… let's all just sit back and relax.
FORD: You have an interesting way of relaxing.
BUFFY: Do you have any idea what you've done?
FORD: I do what I have to.
BUFFY: What you have to?
CHANTARELLE: Why are you fighting it? It's what  we want.
DIEGO: It's our chance for immortality.
CHANTARELLE: This is a beautiful day! Can't you  see that?
BUFFY: What I can see is that right after the sun  goes down Spike and his friends are  gonna be pigging out at the all-you-can-eat  moron bar!
DIEGO: That's it. I think we should gag her.
BUFFY: (gives him the look) I think you should try.
DIEGO: She's an unbeliever. She taints us.
BUFFY: I'm trying to save you! You're playing  in some serious traffic here, do you  understand that? You're gonna DIE.  The only hope you have of surviving  is to get out of this pit right now and  my God could you HAVE a dorkier outfit?
FORD: Gotta back her up, D. You look like  a big ninny.
FORD: 6:27. Sunset.
SPIKE: So. Who's hungry?
SPIKE: When we get there, everybody spread out.  Two men on the door. First priority is the  Slayer, everything else is fair game but  let's remember to share, people.
SPIKE: Sure you're up for this?
SPIKE: And a special one you'll have. Lucius!
SPIKE: Bring the car 'round.
BUFFY: No, I don't.
BUFFY: Us? We have something in common now?
FORD: More than you think.
BUFFY: Let me explain this to you. You're what  we call the bad guy.
FORD: I guess I am. Cool.
BUFFY: These people aren't gonna get changed,  are they? You, maybe, in exchange for  me, but the rest of them -- they're just fodder.
FORD: Technically, yes. But I'm in. I will  become immortal.
BUFFY: I got a newsflash, braintrust. That's not  how it works. You die. And a demon  sets up shop in your old house. It walks  and talks and remembers your life but  it's not you.
FORD: It's better than nothing.
BUFFY: Your life is nothing?
BUFFY: Ford, these people don't deserve to die.
FORD: Neither do I! But apparently nobody  took that into consideration, 'cause I'm  still dying.
FORD: I look good, don't I? Let me tell you  something. I got maybe six months left  and by then what they bury won't even  look like me. It'll be bald and shriveled  and it'll smell bad. Not human. I'm not  going out that way.
FORD: I'm sorry, Summers, did I screw up your  righteous anger riff? Does the nest of tumors  liquefying my brain kind of spoil the fun?
BUFFY: I'm sorry. I had no idea… But this is  still very wrong.
FORD: Okay, well, you try vomiting for twenty  four hours straight because the pain your  head is so intense and then we'll discuss  the concept of right and wrong.  (indicating the others) These people are sheep. They want to  be vampires 'cause they're lonely, or  miserable, or bored. I don't have a choice.
BUFFY: You have a choice. You don't have a  good choice: what's behind door number  three is pretty much a dead fish but you  have a choice. You're opting for mass  murder here and nothing you say to  me is gonna make that okay.
FORD: You think I need to justify myself to you?
BUFFY: I think this is part of your little fantasy  drama. Isn't this just how you imagined it?  You tell me how you've suffered and  I feel sorry for you. Well I do feel  sorry for you and if those vampires  come in here and start feeding I'll kill  you myself.
FORD: You know what, Summers? I really  did miss you.
BUFFY: Ford, please. Help me stop this.
BUFFY: Listen to me. This is not the mothership,  okay? This is ugly death come to play.  If we can barricade the door maybe we  can hold them off and try to find another --
SPIKE: (to his men)  Take them all. Save the Slayer for me!
BUFFY: Spike!
SPIKE: Everybody STOP!
BUFFY: Good idea. Now they all walk out or  your girlfriend fits in an ashtray.
DRUSILLA: Spike…
SPIKE: It's gonna be all right, baby. (To his men) Let them go.
BUFFY: (to Spike) Down the stairs. Do it now.
BUFFY: You think I'm joking? You think I'm  feeling jolly right now?
BUFFY: You guys got here just in time… to be late.
ANGEL: Why didn't you tell us you were  coming here?
WILLOW: Are there vampires --
BUFFY: They're contained. They'll get out eventually,  though. We should clear out. We can  come back when they're gone.
XANDER: Come back for what?
BUFFY: For the body.
FORD: What happened?
SPIKE: We're stuck in the basement.
FORD: Buffy?
SPIKE: She's not stuck in the basement.
FORD: Hey, well, I delivered. I handed her  to you.
SPIKE: Yes, I suppose you did.
FORD: So what about my reward?
BUFFY: I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
GILES: You don't need to say anything.
BUFFY: It'd be simpler if I could just hate him.  I think he wanted me to. I think it made  it easier for him. Be the bad guy. The  villain of the piece. But really, he  was scared.
GILES: I suppose he was.
BUFFY: You known it's just, like, nothing's simple.  I'm always trying to work it out. Who to  hate, or love … who to trust… it's like  the more I know, the more confused I get.
GILES: I believe that's called growing up.
BUFFY: (little voice) I'd like to stop, then. Okay?
GILES: I know the feeling.
BUFFY: Well, does it ever get easy?
GILES: You mean life?
BUFFY: Yeah. Does it get easy?
GILES: What do you want me to say.
BUFFY: Lie to me.
GILES: Yes. It's terribly simple.
GILES: The good-guys are stalwart and true.  The bad-guys are easily distinguished  by their pointy horns or black hats and  we always defeat them and save the day.  Nobody ever dies…and everybody lives  happily ever after.
