What kind of secret?
But I just think it's customary, if two  people are going out on an evening,  for the both of them to know where  they're going.
But, I -- how will I know what to wear?
Not as such.
All right. I put myself in your hands.
Yes.
No encounters?
Well, I've been researching our new  friend Spike. The profile is fairly  unappetizing -- but I still haven't a  bead on why he's here.
Are you all right? You seem a bit glum.
Yes, even I realize a young person like  yourself can't spend all her time fighting  the forces of darkness. No slaying this  evening. Perhaps you can concentrate  on your homework instead.
Yes, but's considered very poor taste  to have any. Very well. Do whatever  it is you like. You could spend some  time with Angel.
Buffy. Ms. Calendar and I are going…  somewhere … tonight. She's given me  her beeper number in case you need me  for any… (glances at Ford) …study help. Suddenly.
What?
Oh. Very good then.  (pulls Buffy aside) Buffy, you aren't by any chance giving  away your secret identity just to impress  cute boys, are you?
All right. Well, remember, if you need me --
No, you did the right thing.
No! But -- vampires on campus -- there  could be implications… very grave…
No, honestly, I've always been interested  in… monster trucks. I swear.
It was a change.
And miss the nitro burning funny cars?  Couldn't have that. Best part.
And we have to figure out what that  purpose is.
Good. The less he's mixed up in this,  the safer he'll be.
She's called Drusilla. A sometime  paramour of Spike's.
She was reported killed by an angry  mob in Prague.
With Angel?
Some of my newer volumes might be  helpful. My own research has --
A book. It took one of my books.
He lied?
You don't need to say anything.
I suppose he was.
I believe that's called growing up.
I know the feeling.
You mean life?
What do you want me to say.
Yes. It's terribly simple.
The good-guys are stalwart and true.  The bad-guys are easily distinguished  by their pointy horns or black hats and  we always defeat them and save the day.  Nobody ever dies…and everybody lives  happily ever after.
