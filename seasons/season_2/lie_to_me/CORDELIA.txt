I just don't see why everyone is always  ragging on Marie Antoinette. I can <u>so</u>
 relate to her. She worked really hard to  look that good. People don't appreciate  that effort.
Whatever. They were cranky. So they're  like, "let's lose some heads now."  Oh, that's fair. And Marie Antoinette  cared about them. She was gonna let  them have cake!
Who's the tasty treat?
Buffy, you haven't introduced me to  your new friend.
Come on, can't you tell me anything  about him?
In case you haven't noticed there is a  devastating cute guy shortage right now.  The government is calling for rationing  so why does Buffy get to hoard them all?  She has Angel. So come on, what's Ford  interested in?
(deflated) oh great. That's Buffy's best subject.  You sure he doesn't like clothes?
