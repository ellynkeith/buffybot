Drusilla, leave here. I'm offering you  that chance. Take Spike and get out.
If you don't leave… it'll go badly.  For all of us.
Hey. I was hoping you'd show.
Yeah. I eat, too. Not for nutritional  value -- it just kind of passes the time.
There's a lot about me you don't know.
Nothing.
No, I mean I stayed in. Read.
Nice to meet you.
So, you're visiting Buffy?
Good night.
He just moved here?
I can't… unless you invite me.  I can't come in.
If this is a bad time…
Well, I promise to behave myself.
I want you to track someone down.  On the net.
I just want to find everything I can.  Records, affiliates -- I'm not even  sure what I'm looking for yet.
Billy Fordham.
Are you gonna tell me that I'm jealous?
You know, I never used to.
Things used to be pretty simple. A  hundred years just hanging out, feeling  guilty. I really honed my brooding skills.  Then she comes along… Yeah, I get  jealous. But I know people and my  gut tells me this is a wrong guy.
What?
He said he was in school with you  guys, right?
Don't tell Buffy what we're doing, all right?
Just don't bring it up 'til we know  what's what.
That'd be nice.
He leaves no paper trail, no record.  That's incriminating enough.
Could you not call me that?
We're friends of Ford's. He said we  should come by.
Let's look around. You guys check  out downstairs.
Vampires.
You're a fool.
I've seen enough. And I've seen this type  before. They're children, making up bedtime  stories about friendly vampires to comfort  themselves in the dark.
These people don't know anything about  vampires. What they are, how they live,  how they dress…
We need to talk.
It's about your friend Ford. He's not  what he seems.
Willow ran him down on the computer.
We found this address. We checked it  out with Xander and it turned out to --
What are you talking about?
Some lies are necessary.
Sometimes the truth is worse. You live  long enough, you find that out.
Do you love me?
Do you?
First I made her insane. Killed everyone  she loved, visited every mental torture  on her I could devise. She eventually  fled to a convent and the day she took  her holy orders I turned her into a demon.
Ford's part of some society that reveres  vampires. Practically worships them.  I don't know what he wants from you.  But you can't trust him.
Why didn't you tell us you were  coming here?
