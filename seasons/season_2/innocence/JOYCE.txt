Good morning.
Did you have fun last night?
At Willow's.
You hungry?
Well, hurry up and I'll run you to school
Is something wrong?
I don't know. You just look...
Did I miss anything?
Here we go... I'm sorry I didn't have time to make you a real cake.
But we're still going shopping tomorrow.
So, did you have a fun birthday? What'd you do?
You still look the same to me.
Happy birthday. I don't have to sing, do I?
Well, go on. Make a wish.
