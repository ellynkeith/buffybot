Okay.
So, do you guys steal weapons from the army a lot?
I get you.
What?
That time you said it backwards.
Sometime when I'm sitting in class, I'm not thinking about class, 'cause, that could never happen, and I'll think about kissing you and then everything stops. It's like, freeze frame. Willow kissage.
I'm not gonna kiss you.
Well, to the casual observer, it looks like you want to make your friend Xander jealous. Or even the score, or something. That's on the empty side. You see, in my fantasy, when I'm kissing you... you're kissing me.
It's okay. I can wait.
We're up.
Uh, guys? If I was gonna line up, I know where I'd be.
Arm.
