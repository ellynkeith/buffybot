SPIKE: I'm not happy, pet. Angel and the Slayer are still alive, they know where we are, they know about the Judge... we should be vacating.
DRUSILLA: Nonsense. They'll not disturb us here. My Angel is too smart to face the Judge again.
SPIKE: (glancing over) What's Big Blue up to, anyway? He just sits there.
JUDGE: I am preparing.
SPIKE: (wheels around to him) Yeah, it's interesting to me that preparing looks a great bit like sitting on your arse. When do we destroy the world already?
JUDGE: My strength grows. And every life I take will increase it further.
SPIKE: So let's take some! I'm bored!
JUDGE: I fought an army. They hacked me to pieces. For six hundred years my living head lay in a box buried in the ground. (turns to Spike) I've learned to be patient.
SPIKE: Yeah, well, we're gonna need more than patience if Angel and the Slayer are-
SPIKE: Dru?
DRUSILLA: Angel...
SPIKE: Dru! What is it? DRU!
SPIKE: Darling, do you see something?
BUFFY: Angel?
ANGEL: Buffy... Oh, no...
WOMAN: Hey. Are you okay?
WOMAN: You want me to call 911?
ANGEL: No... the pain...is gone.
ANGEL: I feel just fine.
JOYCE: Good morning.
BUFFY: Good morning...
JOYCE: Did you have fun last night?
BUFFY: Fun?
JOYCE: At Willow's.
BUFFY: Oh. Right. Always fun at Willow's. She's a fun machine.
JOYCE: You hungry?
BUFFY: Not really. I ate a little. I'm just gonna take a shower.
JOYCE: Well, hurry up and I'll run you to school
BUFFY: Thanks.
JOYCE: Is something wrong?
BUFFY: No. What would be wrong?
JOYCE: I don't know. You just look...
XANDER: Well, the bus station was a total washout and may I say what a fine place to spend the night? What a vibrant cross section of Americana.
GILES: You saw no vampires transporting boxes?
XANDER: No, but a 400 pound wino offered to wash my hair... (seeing their expressions) What's up? Where's Buffy?
WILLOW: She never checked in.
JENNY: Neither did Angel.
GILES: And if the bus station was as empty as the docks and the airport...
XANDER: You think this Judge guy might already be assembled?
XANDER: Then Buffy could... We gotta find them! We gotta go to that place, that factory. That's where they're holed up, right? Let's go!
CORDELIA: And do what? Besides be afraid and die.
XANDER: Nobody's asking you to go, Cordy. If the vampires need grooming tips,  we'll give you a call.
GILES: Cordelia has a point. If Buffy and Angel were... harmed, we don't stand to fare much better.
XANDER: Yeah, well those of us who were born <u>with feelings</u> are gonna  do something about this.
JENNY: Xander...
WILLOW: No, Xander's right. My God! You people are all... Well...  I'm upset and I can't think of a mean word right now but that's  what you are and we're going to the factory!
WILLOW: Buffy!
XANDER: We were just going to rescue you.
WILLOW: Well, <u>some</u> of us were...
GILES: (defensively) I would have...
JENNY: Where's Angel?
BUFFY: He didn't check in with you guys?
GILES: No...
CORDEILA: What happened?
GILES: Is the Judge...?
BUFFY: (nodding) No assembly required. He's active.
GILES: Damnit.
BUFFY: He nearly killed us. Angel got us out.
GILES: Why didn't you call? We thought...
BUFFY: Well, uh, we had to hide... stuck in the sewer tunnels... and with the hiding... we split up and nobody's heard from him?
WILLOW: No...
JENNY: He didn't say where he was going?
BUFFY: No, we just... we just split up.
WILLOW: I'm sure he'll come by.
BUFFY: (not convinced) You're right. I'm sure.
GILES: Buffy, the Judge. We have to stop him.
BUFFY: I know.
GILES: What can you tell us?
BUFFY: Not much. I just touched him - kicked him - and it was like a sudden fever. If he'd gotten his hands on me -
GILES: In time he won't have to. The stronger he gets... he'll be able to burn us all with a look.
BUFFY: Also not the <b>prettiest</b> man in town.
GILES: I'll just have to keep researching, look for a weakness. You all should get to your classes.
JENNY: I better go too. I'll go on the net and search for anything on the Judge.
GILES: Thank you.
XANDER: We'll stop in after classes, help you research.
CORDELIA: (to Xander) Yeah, you might find something useful - if it's in an I-Can-Read book.
WILLOW: You don't think Angel would have gone after the Judge himself, do you?
BUFFY: No... he'd know better than that. Maybe he needed to... I don't know. I just wish he'd contact me. I need to talk to him.
TEACHER: So, can somebody tell me some of the differences between the  Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks? What really separated them? Anyone?
TEACHER: Miss Summers, I'm sorry, did you have somewhere important to be?
BUFFY: Angel?
SPIKE: Soon as it gets dark, I want you patrolling the street. Plus two  Men on the door and down in the tunnels at all times, is that  clear? I don't want any more surprises.
SPIKE: Are we feeling better, then?
DRUSILLA: I'm naming all the stars.
SPIKE: Can't see the stars, love. That's the ceiling. Also, it's day.
DRUSILLA: I can see them. But I've named them all the same name, and  there's terrible confusion. I fear there may be a duel.
SPIKE: Recovered, then, have we? Did you see any further? Do you know  what happens to Angel?
ANGEL: Well, he moves to New York and tries to fulfill that Broadway dream.  It's tough sledding, but one day he's working in the chorus when the big  star twists her ankle!
SPIKE: Angel.
ANGEL: Still having trouble guarding your perimeter, brother. Your boys downstairs are going to wake up sore.
SPIKE: You don't give up, do you?
ANGEL: (noble tough guy) As long as there is injustice in this world... As long as scum like you is walking - or, well, rolling - the streets, I'll be around. Look over your shoulder. I'll be there.
SPIKE: Yeah, uh, Angel... Look over your shoulder.
SPIKE: Hurts, doesn't it?
ANGEL: Well, you know, it kind of itches a little.
SPIKE: Don't just stand there, burn him!
ANGEL: Gee, maybe he's broken.
SPIKE: What the hell is going on?
DRUSILLA: (gets it) Oh my...
SPIKE: Clean? You mean he's -
ANGEL: Couldn't have said it better myself.
DRUSILLA: Angel...?
ANGEL: Yeah, baby. I'm back.
SPIKE: It's really true?
ANGEL: It's really true.
DRUSILLA: You've come home.
SPIKE: No more of this "I've got a soul" crap?
ANGEL: What can I say? I was going through a phase
SPIKE: This is great! This is so great.
DRUSILLA: Everything in my head is singing. We're family again. We'll feed, and we'll play...
SPIKE: I gotta tell you, it made me sick to my stomach seeing you being  the Slayer's lapdog -
DRUSILLA: How did this happen?
ANGEL: You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
SPIKE: Who cares! What matters is he's back. Now it's four against one, which are the kind of odds I like to play.
DRUSILLA: We're going to destroy the world. Do you want to come?
ANGEL: Yeah, destroying the world... great. I'm really more interested in the Slayer.
SPIKE: Well, she's <b>in</b> the world, so it should work out.
ANGEL: Give me tonight.
SPIKE: What do you mean?
ANGEL: Lay low for a night. Let me work on her. I guarantee by the time you go public, she won't be anything resembling a threat.
SPIKE: You've really got a yen to hurt this girl, haven't you?
ANGEL: She made me feel like a human being. That's not the kind of thing you just forgive.
SPIKE: What do you say, Dru? Do we let him play?
DRUSILLA: Yes... there's going to be a river of blood.
ANGEL: Be just like old times.
WILLOW: Okay... No, no he didn't... but I'm sure he'll... Buffy, he probably has some plan and he's trying to protect you... well, I don't know what, I'm not in on the plan, it's his plan... No. NO. Don't even say that.  Angel is not dead.
XANDER: Say hi for me.
WILLOW: (into phone) Okay... Yeah, we'll be here. Of course. Bye.
WILLOW: Say hi for me?
XANDER: What's the word?
WILLOW: She checked every place she could think of. She even beat up Willy the snitch a couple of times. Angel's vanished.
GILES: He does do that on occasion, no?
WILLOW: Yeah, but she's extra wigged this time - I guess 'cause of her dreams. God, what if something did happen to him?
GILES: Is she going to join us here?
WILLOW: Yeah, she's just stopping at home first.
XANDER: Nada.
XANDER: Anything?
CORDELIA: This book mentions the Judge, but... nothing useful... big scary, no weapon forged can stop him... took an army to take him down blah blah blah.
XANDER: We need some insight. A weak spot.
CORDELIA: Well, we're not gonna find it here.
XANDER: I'm sorry I snapped at you before.
CORDELIA: Oh yeah, I'm reeling from <u>that</u> new experience.
XANDER: I was crazed. I wasn't thinking.
CORDELIA: You were too busy rushing off to die for your beloved Buffy. (pouting) You'd never die for me.
XANDER: (with playful intimacy) I might die <u>from</u> you, does that get me any points?
CORDELIA: No.
XANDER: Come one, let's kiss and make up.
CORDELIA: I don't wanna make up.
CORDELIA: But I'm okay with the other part.
XANDER: Isn't it better when we're friends?
XANDER: Willow! We were just-
GILES: Oh, Willow, did you find the index to-
GILES: Any luck with-
GILES: Well. Yes. Interesting children.
XANDER: Willow, come on!
WILLOW: I knew it! I knew it! Well, not "knew it" in the sense of having the slightest idea, but I knew there was something I didn't know. You two were fighting way too much. It's not natural.
XANDER: I know, it's weird...
WILLOW: Weird? It's against all the laws of God and man! That's <u>Cordelia</u>! Remember? The "we hate Cordelia Club," of which you are the treasurer?
XANDER: I was gonna tell you...
WILLOW: Gee, what stopped you? Could it be <u>shame</u>?
XANDER: All right! Let's overreact, shall we? We were kissing. It doesn't mean that much.
WILLOW: (softly) No. It just means you'd rather be with someone you hate... then be with me.
BUFFY: Angel!
ANGEL: Hey.
BUFFY: Oh, God, I was so worried...
ANGEL: Didn't mean to frighten you...
BUFFY: Where did you go?
ANGEL: Been around.
BUFFY: I was freaking out. You just disappeared...
ANGEL: What, I took off.
BUFFY: Well, you didn't even say anything. You just left.
ANGEL: Yeah, like I really wanted to stick around after <b>that</b>.
BUFFY: (totally thrown) After... What do you...
ANGEL: You got a lot to learn about men, kiddo. Although I guess you proved that last night.
BUFFY: What are you saying?
ANGEL: Let's not make an issue out of it. In fact let's not talk about it at all. It happened.
BUFFY: I don't' understand. Was I... was it... not good?
ANGEL: No, you were great! Really. I thought you were a pro.
BUFFY: God, Angel, how can you say those things to me?
ANGEL: Lighten up. It was a good time. Doesn't mean we have to make a big deal.
BUFFY: It is a big deal!
ANGEL: It's what? Fireworks. Bells ringing. A dulcet choir of pretty little birdies. Come on, Buffy, it's not like I've never been there before.
BUFFY: Get away from me.
ANGEL: I should have known you wouldn't be able to handle it.
BUFFY: (a last plea) Angel... I <b>love</b> you.
ANGEL: Love ya too. (turns to go) I'll call ya.
MAN: Do you know what it is, this thing vengeance?
JENNY: Uncle, I have served you. I've been faithful and I need to know -
MAN: To the modern man, vengeance is an idea, a word. Payback, one thing  for another, like commerce. Not for us. Vengeance is a living thing.  It moves through the generations. It commands. It kills.
JENNY: Something has happened. Something has changed.
MAN: Everything has changed.
JENNY: You told me to watch Angel. You told me to keep him from the Slayer. I tried. But there are other factors, there are terrible things happening here that we cannot control.
MAN: We control nothing. We are not wizards, Janna. We merely play our part.
JENNY: Angel could be of help to us - he may be the only chance we've got to stop the Judge.
MAN: It is too late for that.
JENNY: Why?
MAN: The curse... Angel was meant to suffer. Not to live as a human. One moment of true happiness, of contentment... one moment where his soul that we restored does not plague his thoughts - and that soul is taken from him.
JENNY: Then if he somehow has... if it's happened, then Angelus is back.
MAN: I hoped to stop it. But I see now that it was arranged to be so.
JENNY: Buffy loves him.
MAN: And now she will have to kill him.
JENNY: Unless he kills her first! Uncle, this is insanity. People are going to <b>die</b>.
MAN: Yes. This is not justice that we serve. It is vengeance.
JENNY: You're a fool. We're all fools.
XANDER: Will!
WILLOW: (sullenly) Hey.
XANDER: Where did you go?
WILLOW: Home. Or, partway home. Then I came back. Now I'm here.
XANDER: I'm glad you came back. We can't do this without you.
WILLOW: Let's get this straight. I don't understand it. I don't want to understand it. You have gross emotional problems and things  are not okay between us. But what's happening right now is  more important than that.
XANDER: Willow, I just -
WILLOW: No.
XANDER: Okay.
WILLOW: What about the Judge? Where do we stand?
XANDER: On a pile of really boring books that all say exactly the same thing.
WILLOW: Let me guess. "No weapon forged..."
XANDER: "It took an army..."
WILLOW: Yeah, where's an army when you need one?
WILLOW: What?
XANDER: Wow. Wow. I think I'm having a thought. I am. I'm having a thought. And now I'm having a plan.
XANDER: And now I'm having a wiggins.
WILLOW: What's going on?
XANDER: Let's get back to the library.
ANGEL: Willow? Xander?
XANDER: Angel!
WILLOW: Thank god you're okay! Have you seen Buffy?
ANGEL: Yeah. What's up with the lights?
XANDER: I don't know. Listen, I think I might have an idea -
ANGEL: That doesn't matter now. I've got something to show you.
WILLOW: Show us?
XANDER: Come here. And Xander, get the others.
XANDER: Okay...
WILLOW: What is it, Angel?
ANGEL: It's amazing.
JENNY: Willow, get away from him.
WILLOW: What?
JENNY: Walk to me.
WILLOW: Ms. Calendar, what are you doing? It's Angel.
XANDER: Don't you do that...
ANGEL: Oh, I think I do that.
WILLOW: (terrified) Angel...
JENNY: He's not Angel anymore. Are you?
ANGEL: Wrong. I am Angel. Angelus. At last.
XANDER: (gets it) Oh my God...
ANGEL: I've got a message for Buffy.
BUFFY: Then give it to me yourself.
ANGEL: Well, it's not really the kind of message you tell. It sort of  involves finding the bodies of all your friends.
BUFFY: This can't be you...
ANGEL: We already covered that subject.
BUFFY: Angel... there must be some part of you inside that remembers who you are.
ANGEL: Dream on, schoolgirl. Your boyfriend is dead. You're all gonna join him.
BUFFY: Just leave Willow alone. Deal with me.
ANGEL: But she's so cute and helpless. It's really a turn on -
ANGEL: Things are about to get very interesting.
XANDER: Buffy, are you okay?
WILLOW: Buffy?
GILES: And we're absolutely certain that Angel has reverted to his former self?
XANDER: We're certain. Anybody not feeling certain here?
WILLOW: Giles, it was just - you wouldn't have believed him. He was so... He came here to kill us!
CORDELIA: What are we gonna do?
GILES: I'm leaning toward blind panic, myself.
JENNY: Rupert, don't talk like that. The kids.
GILES: I'm sorry. It's just, things are bad enough with the Judge here. Angel crossing to the other side... I just wasn't prepared to deal with that.
JENNY: None of us was.
WILLOW: Are you okay?
WILLOW: Is there anything I can do?
BUFFY: I should have known. I saw him... at home and he was... different. The things he said...
GILES: (coming near) What things?
BUFFY: It's private.
JENNY: But you didn't know he had turned bad.
WILLOW: (to Jenny) How did you?
JENNY: What?
WILLOW: You knew. You told me to get away from him.
JENNY: Well, I saw his face.
GILES: If we only knew how it happened...
BUFFY: What do you mean?
GILES: Well, something set it off. Some event must have triggered his transformation.
GILES: If anyone would know, Buffy, it should be you.
BUFFY: I don't... I ...
GILES: Did anything happen last night that might -
BUFFY: Giles, please. I can't... not now.
GILES: Buffy, I'm sorry but we can't afford to... Buffy!
WILLOW: Giles, shut up.
CORDELIA: This is great. There's an unkillable demon in town, Angel's joined his team and the Slayer is a basket case. I'd say we've hit bottom.
XANDER: I have a plan.
CORDELIA: Oh, no, here's a lower place.
XANDER: I don't know what's up with Angel but I may have a way to deal  with this Judge guy.
WILLOW: What do we do?
XANDER: I'm gonna need... I think I'm gonna need Cordelia on this one.
XANDER: And we'll need wheels.
CORDELIA: Well, my car -
XANDER: It might need to be bigger.
WILLOW: (steely-eyes, to Xander) No problem. I'll get Oz. He has a van.
XANDER: Good. Okay.
CORDELIA: Care to let me in on the plan that I'm a part of?
XANDER: No.
CORDELIA: Why not?
XANDER: 'Cause if I tell you what it is, you won't do it. Just meet me at Willow's in half an hour. And wear something trashy - er.
GILES: I'm not sure we what we should do about Buffy.
JENNY: Assuming they don't attack tonight, I think we should let her be.
WILLOW: I agree.
GILES: I can't imagine what she's going through right now.
WILLOW: I don't think any of us can.
ANGEL: You should have seen her face. It was priceless. I'll never forget it.
SPIKE: So, you didn't kill her then?
ANGEL: Of course not.
SPIKE: I know you haven't been in the game for a while, mate, but we do still kill people. It's sort of our raison d'etre, you know.
DRUSILLA: You don't want to kill her, do you? You want to hurt her. Just like you hurt me.
ANGEL: Nobody knows me like you do, Dru.
SPIKE: She'd better not get in our way.
ANGEL: Don't worry about it.
SPIKE: I do.
ANGEL: Spike, my boy, you really don't get it. You tried to kill her and you couldn't. Look at you. You're a wreck. She's stronger than any Slayer you've faced. Force won't get it done. You gotta work from the inside. To kill this girl... you have to love her.
ANGEL: I love you...
ANGEL: You have to know what to see.
GILES: Buffy!
BUFFY: (to Jenny) What do you know?
GILES: Buffy, stop it!
STUDENT: Should I get the principal -
GILES: I'll handle this. You're all dismissed.
BUFFY: Did you do it? Did you change him?
GILES: For God's sake, calm down!
BUFFY: (ignores him) Did you know what was gonna happen?
GILES: Buffy, you can't just go accusing everyone around you of -
JENNY: I didn't know exactly.
JENNY: I was told... I was sent here to watch you. When they told me to keep you and Angel apart, they never told me what would happen.
GILES: Jenny...
JENNY: I'm sorry, Rupert. Angel was supposed to pay for what he did to my people.
BUFFY: And me? What was I supposed to be paying for?
JENNY: I didn't know what would happen until after. I swear, I would have told you...
BUFFY: So it <u>was</u> me. I did it.
JENNY: I think so. I mean, if you...
GILES: I don't understand.
JENNY: The curse. If Angel achieved true happiness, just a moment of... he would lose his soul.
GILES: But how do you know that you were responsible... Oh.
JENNY: If I could do anything -
BUFFY: Curse him again. Can't you do that?
JENNY: Those majicks are long lost, even to my people.
BUFFY: But you did it once, I mean it may not be too late to save him...
JENNY: It can't be done. I can't help you.
BUFFY: Then take me to someone who can.
MAN: I knew you would come. I suppose you want answers.
ANGEL: Not really.
ANGEL: But thanks for the offer.
MAN: You! Evil one...
ANGEL: Evil one? Oh, man, now I've got hurty feelings.
MAN: (backing away) What do you want?
ANGEL: A whole lot. Got a lot of lost time to make up for. Say, I guess that's kind of your fault, isn't it?
ANGEL: You gypsy types, you go and curse people, you really don't care who gets hurt. Of course, you did give me an escape clause, so I gotta  thank you for that.
MAN: You are an abomination. The day you stop suffering for your crimes, you are no longer worthy of a human soul.
ANGEL: Well, that pesky critter's all gone. So we can get down to business.
ANGEL: Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit... after the first hour.
XANDER: Wait here. When you hear that window open, get the ladder out, go up and we'll pass you the package. Okay?
OZ: Okay.
WILLOW: Be careful.
XANDER: Security here is a joke. I really should report it.
CORDELIA: Who are we supposed to be again?
XANDER: You're supposed to be a girl. Think you can handle it?
SOLDIER: Halt!
SOLDIER: Identify yourself right the Hell now.
XANDER: Private Harris, with the... 33rd.
SOLDIER: 33rd are on maneuvers.
XANDER: Right. And I'm on leave. From them.
SOLDIER: You always spend your leave sneaking into the armory, buddy?  And who is she?
CORDELIA: Hi. I'm not a soldier. (to Xander) Right?
XANDER: Look, I just want to give her the tour, you know what I'm saying?
SOLDIER: The tour?
XANDER: Well, you know the ladies... they love to see the big guns. Gets 'em all hot and bothered. Can you cut me some slack, give me a blind eye?
SOLDIER: (still suspicious) Why should I?
XANDER: Well, if you do, I won't tell Colonel Newsome that your shoes ain't regulation, your oakleafs are on backwards and you hold your gun like a sissy girl.
SOLDIER: You got twenty minutes, nimrod.
XANDER: I only need five.
XANDER: Uh, forget I said that last part.
CORDELIA: Okay, what was that? And also, who are you?
XANDER: Remember Halloween? I got turned into a soldier?
CORDELIA: Yeah...
XANDER: I still remember all of it! I know procedure, ordinance, access codes, everything. I know the whole layout of this place and I'm pretty sure I can put together an M16 in fifty seven seconds.
CORDELIA: Well I'm sort of impressed. But let's just find the thing and leave.
XANDER: Okay.
CORDELIA: So looking at guns makes girls want to have sex? That's scary.
XANDER: Yeah, I guess...
CORDELIA: Well, does looking at guns make you wanna have sex?
XANDER: I'm seventeen. Looking at <b>linoleum</b> makes me wanna have sex.
WILLOW: I wish they'd hurry...
OZ: So, do you guys steal weapons from the army a lot?
WILLOW: Well, we don't' have cable, so we have to make our own fun.
OZ: I get you.
WILLOW: Do you want to make out with me?
OZ: What?
WILLOW: With me. Make out. Do you want to?
OZ: That time you said it backwards.
WILLOW: Forget it. I'm sorry. (beat) Well do you?
OZ: Sometime when I'm sitting in class, I'm not thinking about class, 'cause, that could never happen, and I'll think about kissing you and then everything stops. It's like, freeze frame. Willow kissage.
OZ: I'm not gonna kiss you.
WILLOW: What? But... freeze frame...
OZ: Well, to the casual observer, it looks like you want to make your friend Xander jealous. Or even the score, or something. That's on the empty side. You see, in my fantasy, when I'm kissing you... you're kissing me.
OZ: It's okay. I can wait.
OZ: We're up.
JENNY: God...
GILES: Buffy, he's doing this deliberately. He's trying to make it harder for you.
BUFFY: He's just making it easier. I know what I have to do.
GILES: What?
BUFFY: Kill him.
JUDGE: I am ready.
SPIKE: 'Bout time.
SPIKE: Have a good time.
DRUSILLA: You'll be able to hear the screams. I promise.
ANGEL: (to Spike) Too bad you can't come with. We'll be thinking of you.
SPIKE: (glares at him) I won't be in this chair forever. What if your girlfriend shows up?
ANGEL: I'm gonna give her a kiss.
ANGEL: Don't you look spiffy.
XANDER: Happy Birthday, Buffy. Hope you like the color.
BUFFY: Giles, we'll hit the factory first but we may not find them. If  they're on the offensive we need to figure out where they'll go.
GILES: Agreed.
BUFFY: This is good.
JENNY: Do you... is there something I can do to -
BUFFY: Get out.
JENNY: I just want to help.
GILES: She said get out.
XANDER: Do you want me to show you how to use it?
BUFFY: (all business) Yes I do.
BUFFY: I knew it.
GILES: And we haven't a bead on where they would go?
BUFFY: I don't know.
CORDELIA: There's not a lot of choices in Sunnydale. It's not like people are gonna line up to get massacred.
OZ: Uh, guys? If I was gonna line up, I know where I'd be.
ANGEL: (to the vamps) Lock the exits, boys.
ANGEL: (to the Judge) It's all yours.
BUFFY: Everybody keeps back. Damage control only. Take out any lesser vamps if you can. I'll handle the smurf.
DRUSILLA: Oh, goodie!
JUDGE: Who dares...?
BUFFY: I think I got his attention...
JUDGE: You are a fool. No weapon forged can stop me.
BUFFY: That was then.
BUFFY: This is now.
JUDGE: What's <b>that</b> do?
BUFFY: My best present ever.
XANDER: Knew you'd like it.
WILLOW: Do you think he's dead?
BUFFY: You guys pick up the pieces. Keep 'em separate.
CORDELIA: Pieces? We're getting pieces? Our job sucks!
ANGEL: You know what the worst part was? Pretending I loved you. If I'd known how easily you'd give it up, I wouldn't have bothered.
BUFFY: That doesn't work anymore. You're not Angel.
ANGEL: You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? Doesn't matter. The important thing is, you made me the man I am today.
OZ: Arm.
ANGEL: Not quitting on me already, are you? Come on, Buffy. You know you want it.
ANGEL: You can't do it. You can't kill me.
BUFFY: Give me time.
GILES: It's not over. I suppose you know that.
GILES: He'll come after <b>you</b> particularly. His profile - well, he'll strike out at  the things that made him the most human.
BUFFY: You must be so disappointed in me.
GILES: No, I'm not.
BUFFY: But... this is all my fault.
GILES: I don't believe it is.
GILES: Do you want me to wag my finger at you and tell you, you acted rashly? You did, and I can. But I know you loved him, and he has proven more than once that he loved you. You couldn't have known what would happen. The coming months are going to be very hard - I suspect on all of us. But if you're looking for guilt, Buffy, I'm not your man. All you will have from me is my support... and my respect.
JOYCE: Did I miss anything?
BUFFY: Some singing. And some running around.
JOYCE: Here we go... I'm sorry I didn't have time to make you a real cake.
BUFFY: This is perfect.
JOYCE: But we're still going shopping tomorrow.
JOYCE: So, did you have a fun birthday? What'd you do?
BUFFY: I got older.
JOYCE: You still look the same to me.
JOYCE: Happy birthday. I don't have to sing, do I?
JOYCE: Well, go on. Make a wish.
BUFFY: I'll just let it burn.
