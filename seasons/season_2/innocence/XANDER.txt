Well, the bus station was a total washout and may I say what a fine place to spend the night? What a vibrant cross section of Americana.
No, but a 400 pound wino offered to wash my hair... (seeing their expressions) What's up? Where's Buffy?
You think this Judge guy might already be assembled?
Then Buffy could... We gotta find them! We gotta go to that place, that factory. That's where they're holed up, right? Let's go!
Nobody's asking you to go, Cordy. If the vampires need grooming tips,  we'll give you a call.
Yeah, well those of us who were born <u>with feelings</u> are gonna  do something about this.
We were just going to rescue you.
We'll stop in after classes, help you research.
Say hi for me.
What's the word?
Nada.
Anything?
We need some insight. A weak spot.
I'm sorry I snapped at you before.
I was crazed. I wasn't thinking.
(with playful intimacy) I might die <u>from</u> you, does that get me any points?
Come one, let's kiss and make up.
Isn't it better when we're friends?
Willow! We were just-
Willow, come on!
I know, it's weird...
I was gonna tell you...
All right! Let's overreact, shall we? We were kissing. It doesn't mean that much.
Will!
Where did you go?
I'm glad you came back. We can't do this without you.
Willow, I just -
Okay.
On a pile of really boring books that all say exactly the same thing.
"It took an army..."
Wow. Wow. I think I'm having a thought. I am. I'm having a thought. And now I'm having a plan.
And now I'm having a wiggins.
Let's get back to the library.
Angel!
I don't know. Listen, I think I might have an idea -
Come here. And Xander, get the others.
Okay...
Don't you do that...
(gets it) Oh my God...
Buffy, are you okay?
We're certain. Anybody not feeling certain here?
I have a plan.
I don't know what's up with Angel but I may have a way to deal  with this Judge guy.
I'm gonna need... I think I'm gonna need Cordelia on this one.
And we'll need wheels.
It might need to be bigger.
Good. Okay.
No.
'Cause if I tell you what it is, you won't do it. Just meet me at Willow's in half an hour. And wear something trashy - er.
Wait here. When you hear that window open, get the ladder out, go up and we'll pass you the package. Okay?
Security here is a joke. I really should report it.
You're supposed to be a girl. Think you can handle it?
Private Harris, with the... 33rd.
Right. And I'm on leave. From them.
Look, I just want to give her the tour, you know what I'm saying?
Well, you know the ladies... they love to see the big guns. Gets 'em all hot and bothered. Can you cut me some slack, give me a blind eye?
Well, if you do, I won't tell Colonel Newsome that your shoes ain't regulation, your oakleafs are on backwards and you hold your gun like a sissy girl.
I only need five.
Uh, forget I said that last part.
Remember Halloween? I got turned into a soldier?
I still remember all of it! I know procedure, ordinance, access codes, everything. I know the whole layout of this place and I'm pretty sure I can put together an M16 in fifty seven seconds.
Okay.
Yeah, I guess...
I'm seventeen. Looking at <b>linoleum</b> makes me wanna have sex.
Happy Birthday, Buffy. Hope you like the color.
Do you want me to show you how to use it?
Knew you'd like it.
