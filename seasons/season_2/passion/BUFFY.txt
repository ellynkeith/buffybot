Angel. He was in my room last night.
Positive. When I woke up, I found a picture he'd left under my pillow. 
Giles, there has to be some spell to reverse the  invitation, right? I mean a barrier - "no shoes, no  pulse, no service" kind of thing?
(concerned) Giles, Angel once told me, when he was obsessed with Drusilla, one of the first things he did was to kill her family…
(nods) I'm going to have to tell her… something. The truth.
But, I have to do something. Angel has an all  access pass to my house and I'm not always there when my mom is. I can't protect her.
What about until you find a spell?
Easy for you. You don't have Angel lurking in your bedroom at night.
Great, so basically, what you're saying is, "Just ignore him and maybe he'll go away."
(doesn't respond to Jenny) Hey, Will. I thought I might take in a class. I could sure use someone who knows where they are.
It's nothing.
(considers, then) Do you remember that guy, Angel?
Right. Well, he's… and I'm… (chickens out) We're sort of dating. <u>Were</u> dating. We're going through  kind of a serious "off again" phase right now.
In a nutshell. Anyway, ever since… he changed… he's been kind of following me around. (a little heavier) Having a little trouble letting go.
No, no. He's just been hanging around… a lot. Leaving me notes… I just don't want to see him right now. I mean if he shows up, I'll talk to him but… just don't invite him in.
(into phone) I just hope Giles can find a "keep out" spell soon. I know I'll sleep easier once I can… sleep easier.
Hey, no problem. Sorry about your fish.
It's so weird… Every time something like that  happens my first instinct is to run to tell Angel. I can't believe it's the same person. He's the  complete opposite of what he was.
Except what?
I'll see you guys in class.
Hey.
(trying to start) Look, I know you're feeling bad about what happened and I want to say… good. Keep it up.
Wait. I, uh - (one more try) He misses you.
He doesn't say anything to me, but I know he does. I don't want him to be lonely. (avoiding her eye) I don't want anyone to.
We're good here. Let's leave it.
Sleepless… but no fatalities.
Great. All stuff I just happen to have lying around the house.
You really think this'll bother him?
I see your point.
You know, Cordelia, we've already done your car. You can call it a night if you want.
(flatly) Sorry, Angel. I've changed the locks.
That stuff with the herbs and the Latin, that's, um… He's just real superstitious.
I figure if we're careful not to -
Yes. He was the first. I mean, the only.
I know.
Mom, I - he wasn't like this before.
I was…
Mom -
(by rote) I made a mistake.
I know that! Mom, my life is so… I can't tell you everything.
You're not. I'm glad.
How did it go?
Well, what did you tell Grandma when you…
(unheard dialog) It wasn't too horrible…
(unheard dialog, into phone) Hello…?
(unheard dialog, into phone) Giles! Hey, we finished the sp-
(unheard dialog, into phone) What…?
Well? Where's Giles?
(hard) It was Angel, alright.
Cordelia, will you drive us to Giles' house?
(as they get in) I'm not worried about what he wants. I'm worried about what he's going to do.
(flatly) Giles didn't set all this up…
…Angel did. All this is like the pretty gift wrap he wrapped Ms. Calendar's body in.
(shaken) He'll go to wherever Angel is.
(flatly) You're right.
There's only one thing wrong with Giles' little revenge scenario.
(ominous) It's gonna get him killed.
<u>My</u> fun.
You bastard!
How could you do that? You're trying to get yourself killed? You can't! You can't leave me alone… not now… I can't do this by myself!
Sometimes, I wonder if any good ever  comes of it.
Falling in love. Letting your emotions call the shots for you. Because if there is an  upside, I sure haven't come across it. (sighs) You're right about that rule of yours. You're the Watcher, I'm the Slayer… we  don't have the luxury of passion. It just  gets in the way. Life's easier without it.
I'm sorry I couldn't kill him for you… for her… when I had the chance.
