Who?
Yes, but if you invite them in once, thereafter, they are always welcome.
Xander! This <u>is</u> the school library.
(to the student) Yes, third row, historical biography.
So, apparently Angel has decided to step up his harassment of you.
It's a classic battle strategy, to throw ones  opponent off his game. He's <u>trying</u> to provoke you. To taunt you… goad you into a misstep of some sort.
Yes, Xander, once again you've managed to boil a complex thought down to its simplest possible form.
No! You can't do that!
I told you, I'll look for a spell…
Buffy, I understand your concern, but it is  imperative you remain level-headed in this.
I know how hard this is for you. But as the Slayer, you do not have the luxury of being slave to your  passions. You mustn't let Angel get to you, regardless of how provocative his behavior may become.
Precisely.
Not very well. Since Angel lost his soul, he  seems to have regained his sense of whimsy.
He's been in Buffy's bedroom. I'm going to have to drum up a spell to keep him out of the house.
Thank you.
How do you think?
Yes, that's one of the unpleasant side effects of betrayal.
Jenny…
Do you want to?
I understand. But I'm not the one you need to make it up to. Thank you for the book.
Buffy… so, how was your night?
I found a ritual to revoke the invitation to vampires.
The ritual itself is fairly basic, actually: recitation of a few simple rhyming couplets, burning of moss herbs, hanging of crosses, sprinkling of holy water…
You're working late.
Yes?
She is a meddlesome girl
Yes. You could stop by the house.
Good.
Willow? Hi.
(a beat, then) Yes, I should do my apartment tonight. Did the ritual work out all right?
Oh, yes, sorry.
No… thank you, I got it.
Wait! Do you think I should perhaps… intervene on Buffy's behalf with her  mother? Maybe say something.
Well, like… for instance, I could say… that is… (gives up) So, you <u>will</u> tell Buffy I dropped by, then?
(calls out) Hello? Jenny…?
(calls again) It's me…
Of course… yes… procedure. (a flicker of life) I need to make a telephone call first… if that's alright.
(unheard dialog, over the phone) Buffy?
(unheard dialog, into phone) Jenny… Ms. Calendar… she's been killed…
(unheard dialog, into phone) It was Angel…
(unheard dialog, into phone) Willow. Angel's killed Jenny.
They don't hurt enough.
(not happy) Why did you come here? This was not your figh-
(weakly) You don't understand…
Jenny…
Jenny…
In my years as a Watcher, I've buried… too many people. Some I knew… most I didn't. Jenny is the first one that I've loved.
Comes of what?
Yes. It's just not… life.
