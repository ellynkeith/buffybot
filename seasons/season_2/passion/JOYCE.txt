Okay… what's wrong?
Come on, you can tell me anything. I've read all the parenting books, so you can't surprise me.
Angel…? The college boy who was tutoring you in history?
Don't tell me. "He's changed. He's not the same  guy you fell for."
Buffy, has he… done anything…?
Oh, my God…!
(discomfited) You're… Angel.
She told me she wants you to leave her alone.
You're scaring her.
I'm telling you to leave her alone…
(increasing discomfort) Please, I just want to get inside…
Are you threatening her?
I'm calling the police, now.
Oh.
Was he the first?
No. Wait. I don't want to know. Or, I don't think I want to -
He's older than you.
<u>Too</u> old, Buffy. And he's obviously not very stable. I really wish… I thought you would show more judgment.
Are you in love with him?
Were you careful?
Don't 'Mom' me, Buffy - you don't get to get out of this. You had sex with a boy you didn't even see fit to tell me you were dating.
Don't just say that to shut me up because I think you really did.
How about <u>anything</u>? Buffy, you can shut me out of your life, I'm pretty much used to that, but don't expect me to stop caring about you 'cause it's never gonna happen. I love you more than anything in the world.
That would be your cue to roll your eyes and tell me I'm grossing you out.
Well, I guess that was the talk.
I don't know, it's my first.
Nothing! (thinks) I don't think she <u>knows</u>…
(unheard dialog) Willow! My god, Buffy, what's wrong? Has something happened?
