(creepy voice) Welcome. How may I serve you today? Love potion? Perhaps a voodoo doll for that unfaithful...
(drops the creepy voice) Oh, you're in the trade. Follow me. (turns, crosses) Sorry about the spiel, but around Valentine's Day, I get a lot of tourists shopping for love  potions and mystical revenge on old lovers. Sad  fact is, Ouija boards and rabbits' feet are what  pay the rent here.
So… how'd you hear about us?
Ah, you must be Janna, then. Sorry to hear  about your uncle. He was a good customer.
Here ya go, one Thesulan orb. Spirit vault  used in Rituals for the Undead. (shakes his head) Nasty folk, the Undead… Love to shoplift. Insist on haggling…
Don't get much call for those lately. Sold a couple as "new age" paperweights last year. I do love the "new agers." They paid for my  youngest to go to college. (remembers) By the way, you <u>do</u> know that the  transliteration annals for the Rituals for the Undead were lost. Without the annals, the  surviving text of the Rituals is gibberish.
I only bring it up because I have a strict  policy on no refunds.
By the way… none of my business, really,  but what are you planning to conjure up if you can decipher the text?
Oh, yeah. What are you gonna give him?
Can't you read the sign?
(cowed) Wh-what do <u>you</u> want?
