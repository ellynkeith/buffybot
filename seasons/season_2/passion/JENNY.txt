Don't forget I need your sample spreadsheets by  the end of the week.
(calls after them) And I want both a paper print-out and a copy on disk. (to an exiting Willow) Willow…
I may be a little late coming in tomorrow. Do you think you could take over my class until I show?
(calming) Willow… Willow, you'll be fine. I'll try not to be too late, okay.
(trying, a greeting) Hello, Rupert… Buffy.
How've you been?
That sounds bad.
Here. (hands him a book) Might help. I've been… reading up since  Angel changed. I don't think you have that.
How is Buffy doing?
Rupert, I know you feel betrayed.
I was raised by the people Angel hurt the most. My duty to them was the first thing I was ever taught. I didn't come here to hurt anyone.

My uncle, Enyos, told me about you.

A present for a friend of mine…
(at the orb) His soul.
Hi. Is there something - did you want something?
Don't worry, I will.
Buffy, if I have a chance to make it up to you-
Oh, hi.
Special project. (beat) I spoke to Buffy today.
She said you missed me.
Rupert, I don't want to say anything if I'm  wrong, but I may have some news… I have to finish up - can I see you later?
Okay.
Come on… come on…
(exhilarated) That's it! This will work. (a small laugh) This will work.
Angel! How did you get in here?!
"Enter, all ye who seek knowledge."
Angel… I have good news.
Angel, wait…! That's your-
