Spike… Love… I've brought something for you…
Poor thing. She's an orphan. Her owner died… without a fight. Do you like her, Spike? I brought her especially for you, to cheer you u p. (kneels in front of Spike) I've named her "Sunshine." (to Spike, as if to a child) …open wide…
Come on. Love. You need to eat something to keep your strength up. Now, open for Mommy…
My Angel! Where have you been? The sun is almost up, and it can be so hurtful. We were worried.
You must forgive Spike. He's just a bit testy tonight. Doesn't get out much anymore.
Awww, you two boys… fighting over me… makes a girl feel-
(cryptically) The air… it worries. Someone… an old enemy is seeking help to destroy our happy home.
Miss Sunshine here tells me you had a visit today… But she worries. She wants to know what you and the mean teacher talked about?
But, Spike… the bad teacher was going to restore Angel's soul
