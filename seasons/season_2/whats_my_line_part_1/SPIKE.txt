(to Dalton) Read it again-
Debase the beef canoe.
Why does that strike me as not right?
(flashing) Give us some peace, would you?  Can't you see I'm working?
I'm sorry, kitten. It's just - this  manuscript is supposed to hold your cure, But it reads like jibberish-
I'm frazzled is all. I never had the Latin.  Even Dalton here, the big brain, even  he can't make heads or tails of it -

I want the cure -
Why not? Some people find pain -
-very inspirational.
The key? You mean the book is in  some kind of code?

No. Smart guy is right. We have to do  something. There's no way we'll complete your cure with that bitch  breathing down our necks… (then/realizing) I need the big guns. They'll take of her.  Once and for all.
The Order of Taranta.
No. I think it's just enough kill.
No worries. We're close to decoding  the manuscript. We just need a little more time.
By George - I think he's got it.
The key to your cure, ducks! The missing  bloody link! It was -
