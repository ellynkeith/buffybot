XANDER: "Are you a people person or do you  prefer keeping your own company?" What if I'm a people person who  keeps his own company by default?
BUFFY: So - mark "none of the above."
XANDER: There is no box for "none of the above."  That would introduce too many variables  into their mushroom head, number-crunching  little world.
XANDER: It's just - these people can't tell from  one multiple choice test what we're  supposed to do for the rest of our lives.  It's ridiculous.  WILLOW I'm kind of curious to find out what  sort of career I could have.
XANDER: And suck all the spontaneity out of  being young and stupid? I'd rather  live in the dark.
WILLOW: We won't be young forever.
XANDER: I'll always be stupid. (beat) Okay, let's not all rush to disagree…
BUFFY: You're not stupid. (looking up) Do I like shrubs?
XANDER: That's between you and your God.
BUFFY: (to Willow) What'd you put?
WILLOW: I came down on the side of shrubs.
BUFFY: Go shrubs. Okay. (puts down pencil) I shouldn't even be bothering with this.  It's all moot-ville for me. No matter  what my aptitude test says - I already  know my deal.
XANDER: Yep. High risk, sub-minimum wage…
BUFFY: (holds up pencil) Pointy wooden things.
WILLOW: So why are you even taking the test?
BUFFY: It's Principal Snyder's "hoop" of the  week. He's not happy unless I'm jumping. Believe me, I wouldn't be  here otherwise.
WILLOW: You're not even a teensy weensy bit  curious about what kind of career you could have had? I mean, if you  weren't already the Slayer and all.
BUFFY: (snapping) Do the words "sealed" and "fate" ring  any bells for you, Will? Why go there?
XANDER: (to Buffy) You know, with that kind of attitude  you could have had a bright future  as an employee of the DMV.
BUFFY: I'm sorry. It's just - unless hell freezes  over and every vamp in Sunnydale puts  in for early retirement - I'd say my future  is pretty much a non-issue.
DRUSILLA: (sings/discordant) I HEAR MUSIC AND THERE'S NO  ONE THERE… ALL NIGHT LONG  I SEEM TO WALK ON AIR… I  WONDER WHY, I WONDER WHY…
SPIKE: (to Dalton) Read it again-
DALTON: I'm not sure… It could be… Deprimere  ille bubula linter.
SPIKE: Debase the beef canoe.
SPIKE: Why does that strike me as not right?
DRUSILLA: Spike? Come dance.
SPIKE: (flashing) Give us some peace, would you?  Can't you see I'm working?
SPIKE: I'm sorry, kitten. It's just - this  manuscript is supposed to hold your cure, But it reads like jibberish-
SPIKE: I'm frazzled is all. I never had the Latin.  Even Dalton here, the big brain, even  he can't make heads or tails of it -
DRUSILLA: I - I need to change Miss Edith.
SPIKE: Forgive me. You know I can't stand  seeing you like this… (then/frustrated) And we're running out of time. It's that  bloody slayer. Whenever I turn around  she's mucking up the works.
DRUSILLA: Shhhhhhh. Shhhhhhh. You'll make  it right. I know.
SPIKE: Well? Come on now. Enlighten me.
DALTON: (nervous) I - It looks like Latin, but it's not.  I'm not even sure it's a language.  Not one I can decipher, anyway…
SPIKE: Then make it a language. Isn't that  what a transcriber does?
DALTON: Not - not exactly.
SPIKE: I want the cure -
DRUSILLA: Don't -
SPIKE: Why not? Some people find pain -
SPIKE: -very inspirational.
DRUSILLA: He can't help you. (then) Not without the key.
SPIKE: The key? You mean the book is in  some kind of code?
SPIKE: Is that where we'll find this key?
SPIKE: I'll send the boys pronto.
DRUSILLA: Now will you dance?
SPIKE: I'll dance with you, pet. On the  slayer's grave.
BUFFY: Does "rest in peace" have no sanctity  to you people?
BUFFY: Oh, I forgot - you're not a people.
BUFFY: One down -
BUFFY: One gone…
ANGEL: Buffy - you scared me.
BUFFY: So. Just dropping by for some quality  time with Mr. Gordo?
ANGEL: Excuse me?
BUFFY: The pig.
ANGEL: Oh, I, no-
BUFFY: What's up?
ANGEL: Nothing.
BUFFY: You don't have "nothing" face. You have  "something" face. And you don't have to  whisper. Mom's in L.A. till Thursday.  Art buying, or something.
ANGEL: (confesses) I wanted to make sure you were okay.  I had a bad feeling.
BUFFY: (curt) Oh surprise. Angel comes with bad news.
BUFFY: Sorry… I've been cranky miss all day.  It's not you.
ANGEL: What is it, then?
BUFFY: We're having this thing at school-
ANGEL: Career week?
BUFFY: How did you know?
ANGEL: I lurk.
BUFFY: Oh, right. So you know, then. It's this  whole week of "what's my line?" Only  I don't get to play. (then) Sometimes I just want…
ANGEL: You want - what? It's okay.
BUFFY: The Cliffnotes versions? I want a  normal life. Like I had before.
ANGEL: Before me.
BUFFY: It's not that. It's just… This career  business has me contemplating the  el weirdo that I am. Let's face it -  instead of a job I have a calling.  Okay? No chess club or football games  for me. I spend my free time in grave yards and dark alleys…
ANGEL: Is that what you want? Football games?
BUFFY: Maybe. Maybe not. But, you know what? -  I'm never going to get the chance to find  out. I'm stuck in this deal.
ANGEL: I don't want you to feel stuck-
BUFFY: Angel - I don't mean you. You're the  one freaky thing in my freaky world  that makes sense to me. (then) I just get messed sometimes - wish we  could be like regular kids.
ANGEL: I'll never be a kid.
BUFFY: Okay then. Just a regular kid and her  cradle-robbing, creature-of-the-night  boyfriend.
ANGEL: Was this part of your normal life?
BUFFY: My Dorothy Hamill phase. My room in  L.A. was this major shrine - Dorothy  posters, Dorothy dolls. I even got the  Dorothy haircut. (embarrassed) Thereby securing a place for myself  in the Geek Hall of Fame.
ANGEL: You wanted to be like her.
BUFFY: I wanted to be her. (then) My parents used to fight a lot. Skating  was an escape. I felt safe…
ANGEL: When was the last time you put  on your skates?
BUFFY: Like, a couple hundred demons ago.
ANGEL: There's a rink out past Route 17.  It's closed on Tuesdays.
BUFFY: Tomorrow's Tuesday.
ANGEL: I know.
WILLOW: Alone?
BUFFY: Unless some unforeseen evil pops up.  But I'm in full see-no-evil mode.
WILLOW: Angel, ice-skating…
BUFFY: I know. Two worlds collide.
XANDER: Wouldn't you two say you know me  about as well as anyone? Maybe even better than I know myself?
WILLOW: What's this about?
XANDER: (point blank) When you look at me, do you think  prison guard?
BUFFY: Crossing guard, maybe. But prison guard?
XANDER: They just put up the assignments for  the career fair. And according to my test results, I can look forward to being  gainfully employed in the growing field of corrections.
BUFFY: At least you'll be on the right side  of the bars.
XANDER: Laugh now, missy. They assigned you  to the booth for 'law enforcement professionals.'
BUFFY: As in police?
XANDER: As in polyester, donuts, and brutality.
BUFFY: Uggh.
WILLOW: (cheerfully) But, donuts…
BUFFY: I'll jump off that bridge when I come  to it. First I have to deal with Giles-
BUFFY: He's on this Tony Robbins hyper-efficiency  kick. He wants me to check in with him  now every day after homeroom.
WILLOW: You didn't check to see which seminar  I was assigned to, did you?
XANDER: I did. And you weren't.
WILLOW: I wasn't what?
XANDER: On any of the lists.
WILLOW: But I handed in my test. I used a  number two pencil.
XANDER: Then I guess you must've passed.
WILLOW: It's not the kind of test you pass or fail.
XANDER: Your name wasn't up there, Will.
GILES: Oh, Buffy. Thank you.
GILES: I've been indexing the Watcher Diaries  covering the past two centuries. You'd  be amazed at how numbingly long-winded  some of these watchers were.
BUFFY: Color me stunned.
GILES: I trust last night's patrol was fruitful.
BUFFY: Semi. I caught one out of two vamps  after they stole something from this jumbo mausoleum at the cemetery-
GILES: They were stealing?
BUFFY: Yep. They had tools, torches, the whole  nine yards… (then) What does that mean? The whole nine  yards… nine yards of what? Now that's gonna bug me all day.
BUFFY: Giles, you're in pace mode. What gives?
GILES: The vampire who escaped - did you  see what he took?
BUFFY: No - but let me take a wild guess.  Some old thing?
GILES: I'm serious, Buffy.
BUFFY: So am I. I bet it was downright crusty.
GILES: So you made no effort to find out  what was taken?
BUFFY: Have a cow, Giles. I thought it was  just everyday vamp hijinks.
GILES: Well it wasn't. It could be very serious.  If you'd made more of an effort to be  thorough in your observations-
BUFFY: (cutting him off/hurt) If you don't like the way I'm doing  my job - why don't you find someone  else? Oh right. "There can be only one."  Long as I'm alive, there isn't anyone  else. Well, there you go! I don't have  to be the Slayer. I could be dead!
GILES: That's not terrible funny. You'll  notice I don't laugh.
BUFFY: Wouldn't be much of a change, anyway.  I mean, either way I'm bored, constricted,  I never get to shop and my hair and  fingernails continue to grow so really,  what's the dif?
GILES: Must we be introspective now? Our  only concern at this moment should be to discover what was stolen from  that mausoleum last night.
DRUSILLA: It hums. I can hear it.
SPIKE: Once you're well again, we'll have a  coronation down Main Street. We'll invite everyone… and drink for seven  days and seven nights-
DALTON: She almost blew the whole thing for us.  She's trouble.
SPIKE: (sarcastic) You don't say…
SPIKE: Trouble? She's the gnat in my ear.  The gristle in my teeth. The bloody thorn in my bloody side!
DRUSILLA: Spike-
SPIKE: No. Smart guy is right. We have to do  something. There's no way we'll complete your cure with that bitch  breathing down our necks… (then/realizing) I need the big guns. They'll take of her.  Once and for all.
DALTON: Big guns?
SPIKE: The Order of Taranta.
DALTON: The bounty hunters? For the Slayer?
DRUSILLA: They're coming to my party,  three of them.
DALTON: But… The Order of Taranta. I mean,  don't you think that's overkill?
SPIKE: No. I think it's just enough kill.
XANDER: What are you doing here? Fly! Be free  little bird - you defy category!
WILLOW: I'm looking for Buffy.
XANDER: She left with Giles an hour ago. Some  kind of - "field trip" - deal.
WILLOW: If she doesn't get back soon,  Snyder's really - (suddenly perking up) -done a fantastic job setting up the  fair this year, hasn't he, Xander?
XANDER: (facetious) Principal Snyder! Great career fair, sir.  Really. In fact, I'm so inspired by your  leadership - I'm thinking principal  school. I want to walk in your shoes.  Not your actual shoes, of course.  Because you're a tiny person. Not  tiny in the small sense, of course… (then) Okay. Done now.
SNYDER: (to Willow) Where is she?
WILLOW: (innocently) Who?
SNYDER: You know who.
WILLOW: Oh, you mean Buffy? I just saw her-
SNYDER: Don't feed me that I-just-saw-her-a- minute-ago-she's-around-here-somewhere story.
WILLOW: But I did - see her a minute ago.  And she is - around here somewhere.
XANDER: For what it's worth-
SNYDER: It's worth nothing, Harris. Whatever  sound comes out of your mouth is a meaningless waste of breath. An  airborne toxic event.
XANDER: I'm glad you feel comfortable enough  to be so honest with me. And I only hope that I'm in a position one day to  be as honest with you.
SNYDER: Fascinating.
XANDER: I'd love to stay and chat, but I have  an appointment with the warden on standard riot procedure.
WILLOW: Okay. See you-
MAN: Willow Rosenberg?
MAN: Come with us please?
WILLOW: Excuse me?
MAN: Let's walk.
MAN: Try the canape. It's excellent.
WILLOW: What is all this?
MAN: You've been selected to meet with  Mr. Macelroy, head recruiter for the world's leading software concern.  The jet was delayed by fog at Sea-Tac,  but he should be here any minute- (then) Please. Make yourself comfortable.
WILLOW: But - I didn't even get my test back.
MAN: The test was irrelevant. We've been  tracking you for some time.
WILLOW: Is that a good thing?
MAN: I would think so. We're extremely  selective. In fact, only one other  Sunnydale student met our criteria.
OZ: Canape?
GILES: Buffy. Please. Slow down.
BUFFY: Get with the program, Giles.  We have work to do, remember?
GILES: You're behaving in a terrible  immature manner-
BUFFY: Bingo. You know why? I am immature!  I'm a teen! I've yet to mature!
GILES: I was simply offering a little  constructive criticism-
BUFFY: You were harsh. You act like I picked  this gig. But I'm the picked. Too bad  if I want a normal job.
GILES: What you have is more than a… gig.  It's a sacred duty.
GILES: Which shouldn't prevent you from  eventually procuring a more… mundane form of employment if you like. Such as I have.
BUFFY: It's one thing being a Watcher and a  librarian. They go together - like  chicken and… another chicken.  Two chickens. Or something.
BUFFY: You know what I'm saying - you can  spend all your time with a bunch of  books and no one blinks. But what  can I do? Carve stakes for a nursery?
BUFFY: This is the place.
GILES: May I?
BUFFY: Be my guest.
GILES: It's a reliquary, used to house items  of religious significance. Most  commonly, a finger or some other  body part from a saint.
BUFFY: Note to self: Religion - freaky.
GILES: Du Lac… (with recognition and concern) Oh dear.
BUFFY: I hate when you say that.
GILES: Josephus du Lac is buried here.
BUFFY: Was he a saint?
GILES: Hardly. He belonged to a sect of priests  who were excommunicated by the  Vatican at the turn of the century.
BUFFY: Excommunicated and sent to Sunnydale.  Must have been big with the sinning.
GILES: Remember the book that was stolen  from the library by a vampire a few  weeks back? It was written by du  Lac and his cohorts - (frustrated) Damn it. In all the excitement, I let  it slip my mind -
BUFFY: I'm guessing it wasn't a Taste of the  Vatican Cookbook.
GILES: The book is said to contain rituals and  spells that reap unspeakable evil.  However, it was written in archaic  Latin - so nobody but the sect members  could read it.
BUFFY: Then everything's cool. The sect is gone.  Worm food like old du Lac, right?
GILES: I don't like it, Buffy. First the book  is taken from the library. Now vampires steal something from du Lac's tomb…
BUFFY: You think they've figured out how  to read the book?
GILES: I don't know. But something's coming,  Buffy. And I guarantee, whatever it is - it's not good.
PFISTER: Mrs. Kalish?
KALISH: Yes?
PFISTER: I'm Norman Pfister, with Quintessence  Skin Care. I'm not selling anything,  so I'm not asking you to buy. (holds up case) Just to accept a few free samples.
KALISH: Free?
PFISTER: Absolutely.
HANDLER: What the hell -
HANDLER: Hey! You're not supposed to be  in here!
HANDLER: Come on -
WILLOW: (to Buffy) So Giles is sure that the vampire who  stole his book is connected to the one you slayed last night? Or is it "slew?"
GILES: And yes. I'm sure.
GILES: du Lac was both a theologian and a  mathematician. This article describes an invention of his, which he called  the du Lac Cross.
XANDER: Why go to all the trouble of inventing  something and then give a weak name  like that? I'd have gone with  "Cross-o-matic!" or "The Amazing Mr. Cross!"
GILES: The cross was more than a symbol.  It was also used to understand certain  mystical texts - to decipher hidden  meanings and so forth.
BUFFY: You're saying these vampires went to  all that trouble for your basic decoder ring?
GILES: Actually, I guess I am.
WILLOW: (re: article) According to this, du Lac destroyed  every one of the crosses - except the  one buried with him.
BUFFY: Why destroy his own work?
GILES: I suppose he feared what might happen  if the cross fell into the wrong hands.
XANDER: A fear we'll soon get to experience for  ourselves, up close and personal.
GILES: Unless we preempt their plans.
WILLOW: How?
GILES: By learning what was in the book  before they do.
GILES: Which means we can expect to be  here late tonight.
WILLOW: Goody! Research party!
XANDER: Will, you need a life in the worst way.
BUFFY: Speaking of… I have to bail. I promise  I'll be back bright and early, perky  and ready to slay.
GILES: This is a matter of some urgency, Buffy.
BUFFY: I know. But you have to admit, I lack  in the book area. You guys are the brains.  I'd just be around for moral support-
XANDER: That's not true, Buffy. You totally  contribute. You go for snacks.
WILLOW: She should go. You know, gather  her strength?
GILES: Perhaps you're right. There may be  fierce battles ahead.
XANDER: But - Ho Ho's are a vital part of  my cognitive process.
BUFFY: Sorry, Xand. I have something I really  need to do tonight-
BUFFY: Angel?
BUFFY: What ever happened to fat and jolly?
SPIKE: No worries. We're close to decoding  the manuscript. We just need a little more time.
DRUSILLA: Time is ours -
DRUSILLA: It brings the slayer closer to them.
BUFFY: And the hellmouth presents - 'Dead Guys  On Ice'. Not exactly the evening we  were aiming for…
ANGEL: You're in danger. You know what  the ring means?
BUFFY: I just killed a Superbowl champ?
ANGEL: I'm serious. You should go home and  wait until you hear from me.
ANGEL: Are you okay?
BUFFY: What about you? That cut -
ANGEL: Forget about me. You're hurt.
BUFFY: Hey. No biggy. I've been slammed by  bigger sides of beef than that -
ANGEL: No you haven't.
BUFFY: No. I haven't.
ANGEL: This is bad, Buffy. We have to get  you someplace safe.
BUFFY: You mean - hide?
ANGEL: Let's just get you out of here.
BUFFY: Wait. Your eye is all… Let me -
BUFFY: Come on. Don't be a baby. I won't  hurt you.
ANGEL: It's not that. (re: vamp face) I - you shouldn't have to touch me  when I'm like this.
BUFFY: Like - what?
ANGEL: You know. When I'm…
BUFFY: Oh.
BUFFY: I didn't even notice.
BUFFY: This guy was hard core, Giles. And  Angel was power-freaked by the ring.
GILES: I'm afraid he was not overreacting.  The ring is worn only by members of  the Order Of Taranta. They are a society  of demon assassins dating back to  King Solomon…
XANDER: And didn't they beat the Elks last year  in the Sunnydale Adult Bowling League Championship?
GILES: (ignoring him) Their credo is to sow discord and  kill the unwary.
XANDER: Bowling is a vicious game -
GILES: (sharp) That's enough, Xander -
GILES: I'm sorry but this is no time for jokes.  I need to think.
BUFFY: These assassins. Why would they  be after me?
WILLOW: 'Cause you're the scourge of the underworld?
BUFFY: Yeah, but I haven't been that scourgy lately.
GILES: I don't know. But I think the best thing  to do is to find a secure location.  Someplace out of the way where you  can go until we decide on the best course of action -
BUFFY: Okay. You and Angel have both told  me to head for the hills. What's the deal?
GILES: I - this is an extraordinary circumstance…
BUFFY: (scared) When do we have a usual circumstance,  Giles? I mean - mummy girls and snake  guys and… But you've never told me  to hide before. I mean - you're saying  I can't handle this? These guys are that bad?
GILES: You might - They're… They're a breed  apart, Buffy. Unlike vampires - they  have no earthly desire except to collect  their bounty. To find their target and  eliminate it -
GILES: And you are the target. You can kill  as many of them as you like. It won't make any difference - because where  there is one, there will be another. And another. They won't stop coming  until the job is done.
GILES: (OVER) The worst of it is, they are masters of  deceit. Vampires are bound by the Night,  but these predators can be anywhere,  anytime. They can appear as normal as  the next person. Just another face in the  crowd. You might not ever know when  one of them is near - not until the  moment of your death.
BUFFY: Try it!
OZ: Try what?
BUFFY: Sorry.
OZ: I'm still not clear on what I'm  supposed to try.
BUFFY: Nothing.
OZ: A tense person.
WILLOW: I wish there was more we could do.
GILES: We're doing all we can. The only course  of action is to decipher the contents of  the stolen book -
WILLOW: I've never seen Buffy like that. She  just took off.
XANDER: (O.S.) She didn't go home.
XANDER: I let the phone ring a few hundred  times before I remembered her mom's  out of town.
GILES: Maybe Buffy unplugged the phone…
XANDER: It's a statistical impossibility for a sixteen  year old girl to unplug a telephone.
GILES: Perhaps my words of caution were a  bit too alarming -
XANDER: (no duh) You think?
WILLOW: It's good that she took you seriously,  Giles. I just wish we knew where  she was.
BUFFY: Angel?
BUFFY: Hey…
WILLY: We're closed. Can't you read the sign?
WILLY: Oh. Hey, Angel. I didn't recognize  you in the dark there.
WILLY: What - what can I do for you tonight?
ANGEL: I need some information.
WILLY: Yeah? Man, that's too bad. Cause I'm  staying away from that whole scene. I'm living right, Angel.
ANGEL: Sure you are, Willy. And I'm taking  up sunbathing.
WILLY: Come on, now. Don't be that way.  I treat you vamps good. I don't hassle  you. You don't hassle me. We all  enjoy the patronage of this establishment.  Everybody's happy.
ANGEL: Who sent them?
WILLY: Who sent - who?
ANGEL: The Order of Taranta -
WILLY: I tell you - I haven't been in the loop -
ANGEL: Let's try again. The Order of Taranta.  They're after the Slayer -
WILLY: Come on, man…
ANGEL: Was it Spike?
WILLY: Angel, hey, I - I got some fresh pig's  blood in. Good stuff. My fence said the  white cell count is -
ANGEL: You know, I'm a little rusty when it comes  to killing humans. It could take a while.
WILLY: Spike will draw and quarter me, man -
ANGEL: I'll take care of Spike.
WILLY: You know he ordered those guys. Spike's  sick of your girl getting in his way.
ANGEL: Where can I find him?
WILLY: I tell you that and I'm gonna need  relocating expenses. It'll cost you.
ANGEL: It will cost who?
WILLY: Okay! Okay!.. (then) He and that freaky chick of his are -
KENDRA: Where is she?
KENDRA: The girl. Where is she?
ANGEL: Even if I knew - I wouldn't tell you.
KENDRA: Then die.
ANGEL: Who are you?
ANGEL: I won't hurt you if you tell me what  I need to know.
ANGEL: You think this is funny?
KENDRA: I think it's funny now.
KENDRA: That girl. The one I saw you with before -
ANGEL: You stay away from her.
ANGEL: When I get out of here I'll do more  than threaten -
KENDRA: Then I suggest you move quickly.
KENDRA: Eastern exposure. The sun comes in  a few hours. (then) More than enough time for me to  find your girlfriend.
GILES: Xander? …No, I still haven't heard  from Buffy. I think you should go to  her house and check on her.
GILES: Right away. I don't know, get Cordelia  to drive you.
WILLOW: Don't warn the tadpoles!
GILES: My goodness. Are you alright?
WILLOW: Giles? What are you doing here?
GILES: You're in the library, Willow. You  fell asleep.
WILLOW: Oh… I…
GILES: Don't warn the tadpoles?
WILLOW: I - I have frog fear. (then) I'm sorry, I conked out -
GILES: Please. You've gone quite beyond the  call of duty. And, fortunately, I think  I've finally found something -
WILLOW: You did?
GILES: (re: book) I had to go back to the Lutheran Index.  But I found a description of the missing  du Lac Manuscript. It's a ritual, Willow.  I haven't managed to decipher the exact  details - but I believe the purpose is to restore a weak and sickly vampire  to full health.
WILLOW: A vampire like - Drusilla?
GILES: Exactly.
WILLOW: What does that have to do with the  Order of Taranta? The assassins?
GILES: I would imagine Spike called them here  to get Buffy out of the way. I'm sure he  wants nothing to come between him  and his plans to revive his lady love.
WILLOW: So this is good. We know what the deal is.
GILES: I wish I could agree. But all we know  is the goal of the ritual. We don't know where it will take place  or when. We don't know what it entails -
WILLOW: So this is bad.
GILES: No. No. We just have more work to do.
WILLOW: Then - why are you all pinched?
SPIKE: By George - I think he's got it.
SPIKE: The key to your cure, ducks! The missing  bloody link! It was -
DRUSILLA: -right in front of us.
XANDER: That's what a lot of the guys say.  But it's just locker room talk. I never  pay it any mind.
CORDELIA: Great. So now I'm your taxi and  your punching bag -
XANDER: I like to think of you more as my witless  foil - but have it your way.
XANDER: Come on, Cordy. You can't be a member  of the Scooby Gang if you aren't willing  to be inconvenienced now and then -
CORDELIA: Oh, right. Cause I lie awake at night  hoping you tweekos will be my best  friends. And that my first husband will  be a balding, demented homeless man -
XANDER: Buffy could be in trouble -
CORDELIA: And, what, exactly, are you going to  do about it if she is? If you hadn't  noticed - you're the lameness. She's  the superchick or whatever.
XANDER: At least I'm the lameness that cares.  Which is more than you can say. (then) I'm going to check upstairs.
PFISTER: Good day. I am Norman Pfister with  Quintessence Skin Care and Cosmetics.  I was wondering if I could interest you  in some free samples?
CORDELIA: Free?
BUFFY: You must be number two -
BUFFY: Thanks for the wake-up. But I'll stick  with my clock radio.
BUFFY: Come on. Don't make me do the  chick fight thing -
KENDRA: Chick… fight?
BUFFY: You know -
BUFFY: Cliched - but effective.
KENDRA: Who are you?
BUFFY: What do you mean who am I? You  attacked me. Who the hell are you?
KENDRA: I am Kendra, the vampire slayer.
