How we doing, Cam?
Well, luckily his nose isn't broken. But it sure as hell's gonna sting for a couple of days.
Oh. I'm gonna need Cameron back a hundred and ten percent. He's the best swimmer I got, now that Dodd...
Walker, you better hit the steam room when you're done here. Try to keep those sinuses clear. (to Nurse) Ruthie, you take care of my boy.
And you, try to dress more appropriately from now on. This isn't a dance club.
Okay, son. I think you've had enough. Time to hit the shower.
This is such a blow. Sooner or later the rest of my boys are gonna find out. How can I ask them to swim?
I don't have a full team as it is. If we don't find someone at tryouts this afternoon we won't be eligible to compete.
Harris, you can flirt on your own time.
How could this happen?
You work so hard, you start winning suddenly... you like to think it's just you, you're just inspiring the boys to greatness. But in the back of your mind, you wonder...
(shakes his head) Maybe I was afraid to.
Are you a quitter? here's no room for quitters on this team.
We're very close to perfecting this. We just need to adjust the mix.
They're gonna be the best. I don't settle for anything less.
Lost? They're not lost.
Looking after my boys. They may be out of the game right now, but we're still a team.
And a team's gotta eat.
Quitter.
You've got quite an imagination, Missy.
You don't have any proof that --
After the fall of the Soviet Union, documents came to light detailing experiments with fish DNA on their Olympic swimmers. Tarpon, mako shark... But they never cracked it.
What kind of a question is that? For the win. To make my team the best they could be. Do you understand we have a shot at the State Championship?
Boy, when they were handing out school spirit you didn't even get on line, did you?
Get in the hole.
IN. NOW!
You think I don't care about my boys. But I do. They count on me.
Oh, they've had their dinner.
But boys have other needs.
Harris. How are you feeling?
