XANDER: All I'm saying is, it was a stupid idea to have a victory party on the beach. it's officially nippy. So say my nips.
WILLOW: I think it's festive. A party with nature.
CORDELIA: Well, it's the team's choice. It was their victory.
XANDER: (scoffs) Team. Swim team. Hardly what I  call a team. The Yankees... Abbott  and Costello... Those were teams.
CORDELIA: Jealous?
XANDER: No. Yes. But more no than yes.  I mean, look at that...
CORDELIA: Hey, all I know is, my cheerleading squad's wasted a lot of pep on losers. it's about time our school excelled at something.
WILLOW: You're forgetting our high mortality rate.
XANDER: (with pumped pride) We're number one!
CAMERON: Isn't it?
BUFFY: Yeah. It's so... so...
CAMERON: Eternal. Our true mother giving birth to new life, and devouring old... Always adaptable and nurturing, yet constant and merciless.
BUFFY: (Impressed) Boy. I was just gonna go with 'big' and 'wet.'
CAMERON: Me and some of the other guys on the team come out once a week to train in it. Swim against the current.
BUFFY: Funny. That's just how I feel most of the time. So, Cameron Walker...
BUFFY: You've just won the state semi- finals, what are you gonna do now?
CAMERON: I'm going to hang out with Buffy Summers. Get to know her.
BUFFY: Uh, whoa. Pause button. Cam--
CAMERON: Hey, no pressure. I'm just saying I like being around you, that's all.
DODD: C'mon, Jonny, you gotta hold your breath longer than that if you ever want to make the team. Somebody  time him.
DODD: Hey!
BUFFY: Classy tat. I take it they ran out of Tweety-Bird.
DODD: What's your problem?
CAMERON: Had it coming, bro.
GAGE: Chill, dude. A bunch of us are  gonna take a little night dip down  the beach. You in?
DODD: (eyeing Buffy) Whatever.
BUFFY: Let's find you a towel.
JONATHON: (incensed) Why don't you mind your own business. I can handle this without your help.
BUFFY: Isn't it fun to hang out with me?
DODD: Man, that chick gives me the creeps.
GAGE: Dude. What is that foulness?
GAGE: Hey, Dodd! Dude!
WILLOW: Okay, really good pie charts, guys. Good, good, good.
WILLOW: Gage, your pie chart... It's looking a lot like solitaire... (looking closer) with naked ladies on the cards.
GAGE: What's your point?
WILLOW: No point.
SNYDER: Nice work in yesterday's meet, son. Now let's go for it!
SNYDER: Rosenberg. How's the class -- everything in order?
WILLOW: Well, actually --
SNYDER: Great. I've been talking to the board -- we're having trouble finding a competent teacher this late in the term. Do you think you can continue subbing through finals?
WILLOW: Oh, sure. I like teaching.
SNYDER: Isn't that nice. You're a team player and I like that. A team player wants everyone on the team  to succeed. Wants everyone to pass.
WILLOW: (not getting the segue) Uh, yeah, okay...
SNYDER: I understand there's a problem with Gage Petronzi.
WILLOW: Oh, good, then you know. Well, besides the behavior problem, he won't do homework, his test scores are, well, actually he doesn't have any test scores since he never shows up when we have--
SNYDER: I'm not interested in any of that. I'm interested in why, when this school is on the brink of winning its first State Championship in fifteen years, you slap a crucial member of the team with a failing grade that would force his removal. Is this how you show your school spirit?
WILLOW: Yes. I mean, no. I mean, I'm just trying to grade fairly.
SNYDER: Gage is a champion. He's under more pressure than the other students. And I think we need to cut him some slack.
WILLOW: You're asking me to change his grade.
SNYDER: I never said any such thing. All I'm suggesting is you recheck your figures. I think you'll find a grade more fitting to an athlete of Gage's stature. Perhaps something in a 'D.'
XANDER: Just like that? He actually told you to alter his grade.
WILLOW: Exactly. Except for the actually telling me to. But he made it perfectly clear what he wasn't telling me.
XANDER: That is wrong. Big, fat, spanking wrong. It's a slap in the face to every one of us that worked hard and studied long hours to earn our D's.
CORDELIA: Xander, I know you take pride in being the voice of the common wuss, but the truth is certain people are entitled to special privileges. They're called winners. That's the way the world works.
XANDER: And about that nutty "all men are created equal" thing?
CORDELIA: (rolling her eyes) Propaganda spouted by the ugly and less deserving.
XANDER: I think it was Lincoln.
CORDELIA: Disgusting mole and a stupid hat.
WILLOW: Actually it was Jefferson.
CORDELIA: Kept slaves. (a challenge) Got any more?
XANDER: You know what really grates my cheese? Buffy's not here to share my moral outrage about swim team perks...
CAMERON: See, when I'm out in the vastness of the ocean, I never feel alone. It's like the sea is an old friend of mine. You ever hear of Gertrude Ederle?
BUFFY: (her brain dribbling out) No. No, I haven't, Cam.
CAMERON: First woman to swim the English Channel. Same thing. She used to talk to the ocean. Carry on entire conversations. I do that sometimes... Once---
BUFFY: (that's it) Listen, Cam, thanks again. I'd forgotten how nice it is to just talk... or, in my case, listen, without any romantic pressure.
CAMERON: Hey, I'm not about pressure. I want you comfortable.
BUFFY: Oh, I'm comfy. I'm practically nodding off! That's how comfy I --
CAMERON: Are you wearing a bra?
BUFFY: What?
CAMERON: C'mon, tell me you haven't been thinking about this ever since last night.
BUFFY: What I'm thinking about is how much I'd better get out of here.
CAMERON: Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.
BUFFY: Oh, I'm not worried about me.
CAMERON: Ow! You... broke my nose!
BUFFY: I wasn't the attacker. I was the attacked.
SNYDER: That's not how it looked from  where I was standing.
CAMERON: I don't know what happened. First she leads me on, then she goes  schizo on me.
BUFFY: (livid) Lead you on?! When did I lead  you on?!
CAMERON: (to Snyder) C'mon, look at the way she dresses.
SNYDER: (greeting him) Coach.
MARIN: How we doing, Cam?
SNYDER: Coach Marin. How bad does it look?
MARIN: Well, luckily his nose isn't broken. But it sure as hell's gonna sting for a couple of days.
SNYDER: I mean, our chances of winning  the State Championship. Can we  still do it?
MARIN: Oh. I'm gonna need Cameron back a hundred and ten percent. He's the best swimmer I got, now that Dodd...
BUFFY: What happened to Dodd?
SNYDER: That's none of your concern. (re: Cameron) You'd better hope that boy's nose heals before the meet this Friday.
MARIN: Walker, you better hit the steam room when you're done here. Try to keep those sinuses clear. (to Nurse) Ruthie, you take care of my boy.
GREENLIEGH: I always do.
MARIN: And you, try to dress more appropriately from now on. This isn't a dance club.
BUFFY: So now they're treating me like I'm the baddie. Just because he has a sprained wrist and a bloody nose... (realizing it doesn't look good) and I don't have a scratch... Which, granted, on the surface hurts my case a little, but, meanwhile, Cameron gets away with it because he's on the "aren't we the most" swim team, who, by the way, if no one's noticed, have been acting like real jerks lately...
BUFFY: (cautiously) And what's new with you guys?
GILES: Thank you for taking an interest. Apparently, some remains were discovered on the beach this  morning. Human remains.
WILLOW: Dodd McAlvy's remains.
BUFFY: Vampires?
GILES: No. He was eviscerated. Nothing left but skin and cartilage.
XANDER: In other words... "This was no boating accident!"
BUFFY: (to Giles) So, something just split him open  and ate out his insides?
WILLOW: Like an Oreo cookie.
WILLOW: Except, you know, without the chocolatey cookie goodness.
GILES: Principal Snyder's instructed the faculty to keep the news quiet for now so as not to unduly upset the students.
XANDER: For "students," read "swim team."
WILLOW: So, we're looking for a beastie.
GILES: That eats humans whole, except for the skin.
BUFFY: Doesn't make sense.
XANDER: (agreeing) Yeah! Skin's the best part!
BUFFY: Any demons with high cholesterol? (off Giles' look) Later on, you're gonna think about that and you're gonna laugh.
MARIN: Okay, son. I think you've had enough. Time to hit the shower.
XANDER: Too much research. Need beverage.
CAMERON: Watch it.
XANDER: (picking up change) Oh, forgive me, your swimteamliness.
CAMERON: Loser.
XANDER: Liking the nose, Cam. Good look  for you.
CAMERON: Meaning what?
XANDER: Meaning Buffy must not be on your list of privileges after all. Man, I love it when you guys mess with her.
CAMERON: You're lucky I'm hungry.
XANDER: Cafeteria's closed.
CAMERON: Not to me.
CAMERON: God, what is that?
XANDER: Grape, orange. Grape, orange.
XANDER: Anybody, hel--
XANDER: (re: sketch) No, its mouth was bigger, and  turned downward. (demonstrating) Like this. And with more teeth.
CORDELIA: (losing patience) O-kay!
XANDER: And what's that? I said gills, not dimples.
CORDELIA: I'm doing the best I can.
XANDER: (unconvincingly) Ye-ah. I think so... Pretty much.
GILES: (eyeing him) You're not sure.
XANDER: (defensively) Well, it was dark. The think went out the window pretty quick. And I was... a little shocked when I saw it and...
CORDELIA: Go ahead, say it. You ran like a woman.
XANDER: Hey, if you saw this thing, you'd run like a woman, too.
WILLOW: Buffy was right. According to the statistics, Dodd and Cameron were  the best swimmers on the team.
BUFFY: First and second, actually. And if my theory's correct, that means Gage Petronzi, the third best swimmer, may be the next item on the menu.
CORDELIA: God, this is so sad. We're never going to win one State  Championship now. (an anguished insight) I think I've lost the will to cheerlead.
XANDER: Raise your hand if you feel her pain.
GILES: If you're proposing these killings are not random, that would indicate a revenge motive.
BUFFY: And raise the possibility that someone brought forth this sea  demon from whence it came to  carry out that revenge. (hearing herself) "From whence it came?" I'm spending way too much time around you.
XANDER: Who hates the swim team that much? (off their looks) Besides me, I mean.
WILLOW: Oo...
BUFFY: Willow?
WILLOW: Jonathon! He was bullied by Dodd on the beach, remember?
BUFFY: (considering) And he did say he can take care of those guys himself. Good call, Will. You should question him.
WILLOW: Really? Me? (into it) I'll crack him like an egg.
GILES: Meanwhile, I think swimmer  number three might benefit from  your protection and watchful eye. Discreetly, of course.
BUFFY: I'm on it.
XANDER: (to Giles) What about me? What can I do?
CORDELIA: Well, you could go out in the parking lot and practice running like a man.
WILLOW: So, you tried out for the swim team twice and never made it?
JONATHON: I'm asthmatic. I couldn't keep up.
WILLOW: You resented it, didn't you?
JONATHON: Maybe.
WILLOW: You hated being pushed around by  Dodd and the others.
JONATHON: So?
WILLOW: You wanted revenge, didn't you? Didn't you?!
JONATHON: Yeah. Okay. I did!
WILLOW: So you delved into the black arts  and conjured up a hellbeast from  the ocean's depths to wreak your vengeance.
WILLOW: (weakly) Didn't you?
JONATHON: What? No, I snuck in yesterday and peed in the pool.
WILLOW: (disappointed) Oh. (then, disgusted) Ew.
MARIN: This is such a blow. Sooner or later the rest of my boys are gonna find out. How can I ask them to swim?
SNYDER: It's a terrible, terrible tragedy. We all feel your loss, Coach. I don't know two finer boys than Cameron and... that other one.
SNYDER: But I know they would want their friends to go on and win that State Championship. It's time to think of the team.
MARIN: I don't have a full team as it is. If we don't find someone at tryouts this afternoon we won't be eligible to compete.
SNYDER: You'll find someone. All he has to do is wear a bathing suit, right?
GAGE: This me and my shadow act is getting old. What do you want from me?
BUFFY: (off-guard) Oh, I um... Okay. It's a little embarrassing, but, um... (blurting out) I'm a swim groupie.
GAGE: (squinting at her) Uh huh.
BUFFY: Yep. There's just something about the smell of chlorine on a guy.  Hmm, baby--
BUFFY: Okay, my sex appeal seems to be on the fritz today, so I'll straight shoot for a while. There's some... thing lurking around making filets out of the populace and i think you might be next.
GAGE: Uh huh. And you think that because...
BUFFY: It's already attacked... it's already killed some people.
GAGE: You're one twisted sister, you know that? Go find someone else to harass.
GAGE: (to himself) Little wacko bitch pain in the--
GAGE: How'd you know?
ANGEL: She and I... had a thing once. Biggest mistake of my life.
GAGE: My condolences, dude.
ANGEL: She's a real head tripper.
GAGE: Tell me about it. The girl thinks she's God's gift or something.
ANGEL: Who is she, the Chosen One?
GAGE: Exactly.
ANGEL: You know, what she really needs is for someone to knock her down a few notches.
GAGE: That'd be sweet. Anyone in mind?
ANGEL: It so happens, I'm recruiting.
ANGEL: Why, Miss Summers... You're beautiful.
GAGE: So that... Was that the thing that killed Cameron?
BUFFY: No. That was something else.
GAGE: Something else?!
BUFFY: Unfortunately, there are a lot of something elses in this town.
BUFFY: Well... g'night.
GAGE: Walk me home?
CORDELIA: He spit it out? I thought Angel liked blood.
BUFFY: He usually does.
WILLOW: You think his eyes were too big for his stomach?
BUFFY: I think there was something in Gage's blood Angel didn't like. As, for example, steroids.
WILLOW: That would explain all their behavioral changes.
CORDELIA: And the winning streak.
WILLOW: Maybe whatever is in their blood is what's attracting this creature to them!
BUFFY: (to Cordy) Any luck researching our fish monster?
CORDELIA: Zippo. We couldn't find any sea demons that match the description that Xander gave us. Not that Chicken Little was much of a witness. (then) Oh, my.
WILLOW: Xander?
CORDELIA: Xander? What the hell are you doing?!
XANDER: (quietly) I'm under cover.
BUFFY: You're not under much.
CORDELIA: Get out of here before somebody sees you impersonating a swim team member.
XANDER: I don't do impersonations. I tried out for the team last night and I made it.
CORDELIA: Really?
XANDER: Figure I can keep an eye on Gage and the others when Buffy can't.
WILLOW: Like when you're nude. I meant to say 'changing.'
MARIN: Harris, you can flirt on your own time.
CORDELIA: I'm dating a swimmer on the  Sunnydale swim team.
BUFFY: You can die happy. (to Willow) So, Will, what about Jonathon?  He involved?
WILLOW: No, he just, uh... he sort of peed in the pool.
BUFFY: Oh. OH.
XANDER: Don't you guys get claustrophobic  in here? (no answer) I mean, what's the deal? You perspire a lot and can't breathe.
XANDER: You gotta love this undercover deal. Twenty minutes in a hot room with a bunch of sweaty guys.
BUFFY: Where's Gage?
XANDER: He was right behind me, putting his sneakers on. But, they're not the Velcro kind, so give him a couple of extra minutes.
XANDER: Tag, you're it.
BUFFY: Get behind me. Now! Do it!
BUFFY: Gage?
GREENLIEGH: I don't think you'll need stitches, but you should probably have your family physician take a look at it.
GILES: How are you?
BUFFY: I'm definitely feeling the burn.
GILES: Well, the good news is, it would appear none of your team has  actually died.
BUFFY: But the bad news is that they're  monsters.
MARIN: How could this happen?
GILES: Are you saying you don't know?
MARIN: You work so hard, you start winning suddenly... you like to think it's just you, you're just inspiring the boys to greatness. But in the back of your mind, you wonder...
GILES: You never asked the boys if they were taking anything?
MARIN: (shakes his head) Maybe I was afraid to.
BUFFY: (indicating screen) There.
WILLOW: (reading) "Dodd McAlvy... torn tendon. Gage Petronzi... fractured wrist... depression, headaches... "
BUFFY: It's all here in their school medical records.
WILLOW: All symptomatic of steroid abuse.
XANDER: But is steroid abuse usually linked with 'hey I'm a fish'?
WILLOW: There must be something else in the mix. The point is, the boys were obviously drugged.
BUFFY: And Nurse Greenliegh treated each and every one of them. She must have known.
WILLOW: If steroids are that dangerous, why would they do that to themselves?
BUFFY: The need to win. Winning equals trophies equals prestige for the school. You see how they're treated. It's been like that forever.
XANDER: Sure, discus throwers got the best seats at all the crucifixions.
BUFFY: Meanwhile, I'm breaking my nails battling the forces of evil and my French teacher can't even remember my name.
XANDER: So what's the drill? Get Nurse Greenliegh?
WILLOW: (vehemently) Let's throw the book at her! (off looks) Or, a book...
BUFFY: She's probably gone home. It can wait. Xander, try to find out what these boys are taking, or at least how they're taking it. Pills, powder, syringes --
XANDER: I'm looking-around-guy.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) What about you?
BUFFY: Giles is loading up the tranquilizer gun. We're going fishing.
XANDER: I'm feeling good. (no acknowledgment) Loving this swimming. (still ignored) Had some carrot juice this morning, a little wheat germ mixed in...  Woke me right up. Nothing like it... Breakfast of state champions, you betcha.
XANDER: Okay, so, when do we get our next dose?
SEAN: What do you mean?
XANDER: Who's carrying? I need a little something to improve my performance. Give me an edge. (loud whisper) The steroids!? Where are they?!
SEAN: You're soaking in it, Bud.
XANDER: Huh?
SEAN: (taking a deep breath) Aromatherapy...
XANDER: Ahh. The steam. (anxiously) And what steam would that be?
GREENLIEGH: It's got to stop, Carl. These poor children --
MARIN: Are you a quitter? here's no room for quitters on this team.
GREENLIEGH: Listen to yourself! Do you understand what's happening?
MARIN: We're very close to perfecting this. We just need to adjust the mix.
GREENLIEGH: You can't be thinking of continuing to expose the boys.
MARIN: They're gonna be the best. I don't settle for anything less.
GREENLIEGH: They're gonna be monsters! Don't make this any worse. You've lost three.
MARIN: Lost? They're not lost.
GREENLIEGH: What?
GREENLIEGH: Carl! What are you doing?
MARIN: Looking after my boys. They may be out of the game right now, but we're still a team.
MARIN: And a team's gotta eat.
MARIN: Quitter.
GILES: They've been absorbing the steroid mixture through the steam.
XANDER: Not they. We. Me. We need an antidote, don't you think? Clock is ticking, people.
BUFFY: Let's not break out the tartar sauce yet. It's not like you were exposed more than once.
BUFFY: (hopefully) Twice?
XANDER: Three times a fishguy.
WILLOW: Whoa.
XANDER: What am I gonna do?
CORDELIA: You you you. What about me? It's one thing to date a lame unpopular guy. It's another thing to date the Creature From the Blue Lagoon.
XANDER: (correcting her) "Black" Lagoon. The creature from the Blue Lagoon was Brooke Shields. (as an afterthought) And thanks so much for your support.
BUFFY: We need to find the rest of the swim team and lock them up before they get in touch with their inner halibut.
GILES: Yes, good. But we're also going to need to know exactly what was in the steroid gas so the hospital's toxicology lab can develop an antidote.
WILLOW: I'll have a little talk with Nurse Greenliegh.
BUFFY: You're really liking this whole interrogation routine, aren't you?
WILLOW: The trick is not to leave any marks.
BUFFY: Then I'm gonna visit the coach. Somehow I just don't believe that all he's been giving them is inspiration.
MARIN: You've got quite an imagination, Missy.
BUFFY: Right now I'm imagining you in jail. (as to a child) You're wearing a big, orange suit and -- oh look! The guards are beating you!
MARIN: You don't have any proof that --
BUFFY: Tell me what you put in the steam.
MARIN: After the fall of the Soviet Union, documents came to light detailing experiments with fish DNA on their Olympic swimmers. Tarpon, mako shark... But they never cracked it.
BUFFY: And you did. Sort of. Why?
MARIN: What kind of a question is that? For the win. To make my team the best they could be. Do you understand we have a shot at the State Championship?
BUFFY: Do you understand that I don't care? It's over. There's not gonna be any swim team this year.
MARIN: Boy, when they were handing out school spirit you didn't even get on line, did you?
BUFFY: No, I was in the line for 'shred of sanity.'
BUFFY: Which you obviously skipped.
MARIN: Get in the hole.
MARIN: IN. NOW!
MARIN: You think I don't care about my boys. But I do. They count on me.
BUFFY: (looking around) So you're gonna feed me to them?
MARIN: Oh, they've had their dinner.
MARIN: But boys have other needs.
CORDELIA: No one. Willow and Giles must've rounded up the rest of the swim team.
XANDER: Does my neck look a little scaly to you?
CORDELIA: Of course it's scaly, the way you keep rubbing it dry like an idiot.
XANDER: I need to look in the mirror. Wait here. But feel free to come in if you hear me scream.
CORDELIA: (not looking) So... Any gills yet?
CORDELIA: Xander, what are you--
CORDELIA: Xander?
CORDELIA: Oh, my god... Xander... Xander. It's me. Cordelia. I-- I know you can't answer me, but... this is my fault. You joined the swim team to impress me. You were so courageous and you looked really hot in those Speedos.
CORDELIA: I want you to know I still care for you, no matter what you look like. We can still date -- or not date, but... I mean, I'll understand if you want to see other fish... And I'll try to make your quality of life the best it can be, whether you need little bath toys or whatever...
XANDER: Uh, Cordy?
XANDER: That's not me.
GILES: Stay calm. Either we'll find an effective antidote, or... just stay calm.
WILLOW: Everyone's accounted for, except Sean.
CORDELIA: Oh, I think we can safely say we found Sean. He was in the pool, skinless-dipping.
XANDER: Where's Buffy?
WILLOW: She hasn't come back yet.
BUFFY: (quiet, worried) This is just what my rep needs. That I did it with the entire swim team.
XANDER: What's up, Coach?
MARIN: Harris. How are you feeling?
XANDER: A little dry. Nothing a nice lemon butter sauce won't cure. Where's Buffy?
XANDER: I don't like guns.
XANDER: Elbows are neat, though.
XANDER: Buffy! Hurry!
BUFFY: Thanks.
XANDER: Just doing my part for our team.
BUFFY: Coach! Give me your hand --
BUFFY: (grim disgust) Those boys really love their coach.
XANDER: I've got to take a make-up Chem test at three, and I'm meeting some of the guys for plasma transfusions at five. It's turned into quite the busy afternoon.
BUFFY: The fun never stops with you, does it?
WILLOW: Giles seems pretty confident that the treatments are going to work.
XANDER: Turning into a Creepy Crawler wasn't in my "Top ten list of things to do before I turn twenty."
CORDELIA: (to Xander) I just want you to know that you've really proven yourself to me. And next year, you don't have to join the new team if you don't want.
CORDELIA: I'd be just as happy if you played football.
GILES: The people from Animal Control just left. Our creatures have apparently made a dash for it. So to speak.
XANDER: No note?
WILLOW: Does that mean we have to hunt them again?
BUFFY: I don't think so. I don't think we'll see them anymore.
GILES: Where do you think they'll go?
BUFFY: Home.
