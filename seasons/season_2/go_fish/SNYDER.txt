Nice work in yesterday's meet, son. Now let's go for it!
Rosenberg. How's the class -- everything in order?
Great. I've been talking to the board -- we're having trouble finding a competent teacher this late in the term. Do you think you can continue subbing through finals?
Isn't that nice. You're a team player and I like that. A team player wants everyone on the team  to succeed. Wants everyone to pass.
I understand there's a problem with Gage Petronzi.
I'm not interested in any of that. I'm interested in why, when this school is on the brink of winning its first State Championship in fifteen years, you slap a crucial member of the team with a failing grade that would force his removal. Is this how you show your school spirit?
Gage is a champion. He's under more pressure than the other students. And I think we need to cut him some slack.
I never said any such thing. All I'm suggesting is you recheck your figures. I think you'll find a grade more fitting to an athlete of Gage's stature. Perhaps something in a 'D.'
That's not how it looked from  where I was standing.
(greeting him) Coach.
Coach Marin. How bad does it look?
I mean, our chances of winning  the State Championship. Can we  still do it?
That's none of your concern. (re: Cameron) You'd better hope that boy's nose heals before the meet this Friday.
It's a terrible, terrible tragedy. We all feel your loss, Coach. I don't know two finer boys than Cameron and... that other one.
But I know they would want their friends to go on and win that State Championship. It's time to think of the team.
You'll find someone. All he has to do is wear a bathing suit, right?
