All I'm saying is, it was a stupid idea to have a victory party on the beach. it's officially nippy. So say my nips.
(scoffs) Team. Swim team. Hardly what I  call a team. The Yankees... Abbott  and Costello... Those were teams.
No. Yes. But more no than yes.  I mean, look at that...
(with pumped pride) We're number one!
Just like that? He actually told you to alter his grade.
That is wrong. Big, fat, spanking wrong. It's a slap in the face to every one of us that worked hard and studied long hours to earn our D's.
And about that nutty "all men are created equal" thing?
I think it was Lincoln.
You know what really grates my cheese? Buffy's not here to share my moral outrage about swim team perks...
In other words... "This was no boating accident!"
For "students," read "swim team."
(agreeing) Yeah! Skin's the best part!
Too much research. Need beverage.
(picking up change) Oh, forgive me, your swimteamliness.
Liking the nose, Cam. Good look  for you.
Meaning Buffy must not be on your list of privileges after all. Man, I love it when you guys mess with her.
Cafeteria's closed.
Grape, orange. Grape, orange.
Anybody, hel--
(re: sketch) No, its mouth was bigger, and  turned downward. (demonstrating) Like this. And with more teeth.
And what's that? I said gills, not dimples.
(unconvincingly) Ye-ah. I think so... Pretty much.
(defensively) Well, it was dark. The think went out the window pretty quick. And I was... a little shocked when I saw it and...
Hey, if you saw this thing, you'd run like a woman, too.
Raise your hand if you feel her pain.
Who hates the swim team that much? (off their looks) Besides me, I mean.
(to Giles) What about me? What can I do?
(quietly) I'm under cover.
I don't do impersonations. I tried out for the team last night and I made it.
Figure I can keep an eye on Gage and the others when Buffy can't.
Don't you guys get claustrophobic  in here? (no answer) I mean, what's the deal? You perspire a lot and can't breathe.
You gotta love this undercover deal. Twenty minutes in a hot room with a bunch of sweaty guys.
He was right behind me, putting his sneakers on. But, they're not the Velcro kind, so give him a couple of extra minutes.
Tag, you're it.
But is steroid abuse usually linked with 'hey I'm a fish'?
Sure, discus throwers got the best seats at all the crucifixions.
So what's the drill? Get Nurse Greenliegh?
I'm looking-around-guy.
I'm feeling good. (no acknowledgment) Loving this swimming. (still ignored) Had some carrot juice this morning, a little wheat germ mixed in...  Woke me right up. Nothing like it... Breakfast of state champions, you betcha.
Okay, so, when do we get our next dose?
Who's carrying? I need a little something to improve my performance. Give me an edge. (loud whisper) The steroids!? Where are they?!
Huh?
Ahh. The steam. (anxiously) And what steam would that be?
Not they. We. Me. We need an antidote, don't you think? Clock is ticking, people.
Three times a fishguy.
What am I gonna do?
(correcting her) "Black" Lagoon. The creature from the Blue Lagoon was Brooke Shields. (as an afterthought) And thanks so much for your support.
Does my neck look a little scaly to you?
I need to look in the mirror. Wait here. But feel free to come in if you hear me scream.
Uh, Cordy?
That's not me.
Where's Buffy?
What's up, Coach?
A little dry. Nothing a nice lemon butter sauce won't cure. Where's Buffy?
I don't like guns.
Elbows are neat, though.
Buffy! Hurry!
Just doing my part for our team.
I've got to take a make-up Chem test at three, and I'm meeting some of the guys for plasma transfusions at five. It's turned into quite the busy afternoon.
Turning into a Creepy Crawler wasn't in my "Top ten list of things to do before I turn twenty."
No note?
