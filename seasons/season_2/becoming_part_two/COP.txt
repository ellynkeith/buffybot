Back away from the girl! Put your hands up and  back away slowly!
Do it now!
This one's dead.
What about up there?
Get her out of here!
You'd do well to keep your mouth shut, missy.
(to the other cops) In there. (as they go inside,) You know this girl?
That's enough.
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say --
All units, we have a fugitive on foot at the high school, homicide  suspect, female, blonde, approximately sixteen years old, suspect is very dangerous --
Hold it! Right there. Hands above your head. Do it!
