(to Willow) Hey, baby. . . 
(to Willow) How do you feel?
No, it's head-sized.
Try what?
I pretty much missed out on some stuff, didn't I? 'Cause this is all making the kind of sense that's not.
Sure. I'll drive.
Did I mention that I didn't take Latin?
Right. (Reads slowly, in Latin) Quod perditum est, invenietur. (What was lost, shall be found.)
Willow?
(to Cordy) Is this a good thing?
But we know the world didn't end. 'Cause, check it out.
Then she'd want to be alone, I guess.
