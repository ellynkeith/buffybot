Hello, love.
<b>Will you hold on for a second?</b>
Hey! White flag here! I quit!
I'm talking about your ex, love. I'm talking about putting him in  the bloody ground.
He's got your watcher. Right now he's probably torturing him.
I told you. I wanna stop Angel. (smiles) I wanna save the world.
We like to talk big, vampires do. "I'm gonna destroy the world," -- just tough guy talk, strutting around with your friends over a pint of blood.
Truth is, I like this world. You got dog racing, Manchester United, "Love Boat," and you got people. Billions of people walking around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. But then someone comes along with a vision. With a real passion for destruction. Angel could pull it off. Goodbye Piccadilly, farewell Leicester bloody Square, you see what I'm saying?
Why don't you put that stake down?
I want Dru back. I want it like it was, before he came back. (disgusted) The way she acts around him. . . 
I wasn't in on that raiding party --
I can't fight them both alone and neither can you!
And I'm all you got.
Let me just kill this guy --
Oh. Right.
What, your mum doesn't know?
(helping) Right, she plays the. . . triangle --
Drums, yeah, she's hell on the old skins, you know.
Well, I sing.
One of Angel's boys.
He won't get the chance to tattle on us now.
You hit me with an axe one time. (imitating her) "Get the Hell away from my daughter!". . .
Simple. I help you kill Angel, you let me and Dru skip town.
There's no deal without Dru!
(genuinely proud) Dru bagged a slayer? She didn't tell me! Good for her! (off Buffy's look) Well, not from your perspective, I suppose. . .
(to Buffy) Look, this deal works one way only. Full stop. Me and Dru for Angel.
I'll take her out of the country. You'll never hear from us again,  I bloody well hope.
Right.
Now now. . .
Don't let's lose our temper.
You cut him up, you'll never get your answers.
Right about the time you became so pig-headed. You have your way with him, you'll never get to destroy the world. And I don't fancy spending the next month trying to get librarian out of the carpet. There are other ways.
Do you want to play a game?
What if he's lying?
Uh, Drusilla. . .
We are finished here, ducks. . .
Painful, isn't it?
I don't want to hurt you, baby. . .
Doesn't mean I won't. . .
I wish there was another way. . .
God, he's going to kill her. . .
