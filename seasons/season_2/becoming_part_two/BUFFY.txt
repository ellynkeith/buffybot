But, I didn't --
Xander!
(re: Xander) See if he's okay!
I didn't do anything!
You stupid little troll, you have no idea --
Please, see if the others are okay. . . 
Xander!
I didn't know if you were okay. The cops -
Well, what about the others? Are they --
Okay, that was about equal parts protecting me and copping a feel, right?
What is it?
I shouldn't have let her try to do the curse.  Angel must have known.
Where are her folks?
Does Oz know?
You're not hurt?
It was the right thing to do.
(to Xander) You mean he's not here?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Why?
(incredibly calm) I have lost friends tonight, and I may lose more. If you have information worth hearing then I am grateful for it. If you want to make jokes then I will pull out your ribcage and wear it as a hat.
We didn't know. . . 
Whatever I have to.
You don't have anything useful to tell me, do you? What are you,  some immortal demon sent down to even the score between good  and evil?
Why don't you try getting off your immortal ass and <b>fighting</b> evil  once in a while? 'Cause I'm tired of doing this by myself. 
Spare me.
Let me clear this up for you. We're mortal enemies.  We don't get "time-outs."
What are you talking about?
This has got to be the lamest trick you guys have ever thought up.
What do you want?
Okay. You do remember that you're a vampire, right?
Uh, sort of?
'Cause of the whole 'not believing you' issue. You might not be down with Angel but why would you ever come to me?
Oh, you're pathetic!
I've got friends in the hospital - people have died --
(not stopping) -- and I may lose more of them, the whole world could be sucked  into Hell and you need my help 'cause your girlfriend's a big ho?  Let me take this opportunity to <b>not care</b>.
You're a killer.
All right. Talk.
Come on. Let's get inside.
Mom. . . 
Mom, let's go inside --
MOM.
I'm okay. I was. . . busy. . . doing something. And this is  Spike, and he was doing it too.
That, uh, that, uh, I'm in a rock band.
Yes, a rock band, with Spike here. . . .
-- drums --
Why don't we go inside now and talk about it.
(to Spike) You think she's buying it?
Must have been watching me. Or you.
Mom. . . I'm a vampire slayer.
Thank God. . . I'm sorry I can't be there.
Don't be. I just think it wasn't meant to happen. I know I'm  never gonna get Angel back the way he was and, you know,  it makes it easier.
Yes. I got a lucky break.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Xander! Angel and the others are holed up outside town.  You know that funky looking mansion you showed me one time?
I'm gonna hit the place come daybreak. I just need to get something first.
No. You stay there. I'm covered.
I think so. I just wish he was here to tell me what to do.
She's fine. (to Spike) Talk to me. What's the deal?
Forget about Drusilla. She doesn't walk.
She killed Kendra.
I can't believe I invited you in my house.
Of course not!
She was a slayer, Mom.
All right. Get back to the mansion. Make sure Giles is all right.
Mom. . .  (to Spike) Be ready to back me up when I make my move.
If Giles dies, <b>she</b> dies.
It's just fate, Mom. I'm the Slayer. Accept it.
We're not calling the police.
What, did you think I was guilty? Feeling the love in <b>this</b> room, jeez.
We have my word, Mom. Not proof.
You get them involved, you'll get them killed.
Mom, I'm a slayer, not a postal worker. The cops just can't handle demons. I have to do it.
I'm gonna need Kendra's sword.
(impatiently) Just have another drink, okay?
I'm sorry, I don't have time --
I told you. I'm a vampire slayer.
Open your eyes, Mom! What do you think has been going on for the last two years? The fights, the weird occurrences -  how many times have you washed blood out of my clothes, you still haven't figured it out?
It doesn't stop! Do you think I chose to be like this? Do you know how lonely it is? How dangerous? I would love to be upstairs watching TV or gossiping about boys or god, even studying. But I have to save the world. Again.
I'm not crazy, Mom! What I need is for you to chill. I'll be back.
You can't stop me.
You know I didn't do it. The police will figure it out.
You never ever got a single date when you were in  high school, did you?
What did you mean, "the sword isn't enough"?
Tell me how to use it.
Don't worry about me.
I can deal. (looks at the sword, at him)  I got nothing left to lose.
Xander!
You're not here to fight. You get Giles out of there and run like Hell, understood? I can't protect you. I'm gonna be too busy killing.
It's a present for Angel. This ends it, Xander. I'm ready.
Tell me what?
I'm gonna do a lot more than that.
Hello, lover.
You don't have a lot of time <b>left</b>.
No, I don't.
It's not over yet.
Save me a seat.
Me.
Angel?
Shhhhh. . . it doesn't matter.
I love you.
Close your eyes.
