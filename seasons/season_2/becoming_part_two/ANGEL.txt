Hi, Rupert. 
I wasn't sure you were gonna wake up. You had me worried.
I want to torture you. I used to love it, and it's been a long time. I mean, the last time I tortured someone they didn't even <b>have</b> chainsaws.
(turns to look) Oh, yeah, Acathla. He's an even harder guy to wake up than you are. I performed the ritual, said all the right phrases, blood on my hand. . . Got nothing. Big donut hole for my  troubles. I figure you know the ritual; you're pretty up on these things, you could probably tell me what I'm doing wrong.  But honestly, I sort of hope you don't. . .  (turning back to Giles) . . . 'cause I <b>really</b> wanna torture you.
Okay. Where do we start? Ooh. Fingers.
Rupert, buddy, I'm here to tell you I'm impressed. How're you holding up?
Glad to hear it.
Now. Tell me when it hurts.
You know I can stop the pain. You've been very brave, but it's over. You've given enough now let me make it stop.
Tell me what I need to know.
All right, that's it. Someone get the chain saw.
Keep out of it, Sit 'n' Spin.
(suspiciously) Exactly when did you become so level-headed?
Enlighten me.
The blood. Of course. The Blood on my hands must be my own. I am the key that will open the door. My blood. My life. (suddenly matter of fact) Okay, kill him.
Yeah, good point. All right, don't kill him. You know, I like having you watch my back, kind of like old times. . .
Honey. . .
(in Latin) Acathla. Mundatus sum. Pro te necavi. Sanguinem meum  pro te effundam, quo me dignum esse demonstrem. (Acathla. I have been cleansed. I have killed for you.  I will bleed for you and prove myself worthy.)
I don't have time for you.
Coming on kind of strong, don't you think? You're  playing some deep odds here - do you really think you  can take us all on?
You almost made it, Buf.
My boy Acathla's about to wake up. You're going to Hell.
That's everything, huh? No weapons, no friends.  No hope. Take all that away and what's left?
Oh. . .
Buffy?
Buffy, what's going on? I don't remember. . . where are we?
(sees her cuts) You're hurt!
God, I feel like I haven't seen you in months. . .  Buffy, everything's so muddled. . .
Oh, Buffy. . .
What's happening, Buffy?
I love you. . .
