I'd - curb that impulse, Xander.  XANDER Check. Cancel spanking.  GILES What's the matter, Buffy? You look fatigued.
(obliging) So, Angel's alright?
What? You really think Buffy's having premonitions?
I guess it makes sense. I mean, all of Buffy's senses are heightened.  Why should her intuition be different?
Adulthood? Buffy's seventeen tomorrow, Giles. Don't rush her.
Still, you should be careful about treating her like a grown-up. Like -  this thing with Angel. Have you even talked to her about it?
Maybe you should, a little. The way she talks - it's clear she has intense feelings for him  GILES Well, yes. They're friends-
They're more than friends and you know it.
She looks up to you. She'll never actually say that, but she does.  And I just think, at her age, it's easy to get in. over your head.  She could make some bad choices here. Trust me on this one.
You startled me.
Yes. I'm fine. I - I know I haven't written as much lately. I've been busy-
I've been working. And... distracted. I'm sorry.
Nothing's changed. The curse still holds. He's still tortured by all that he's done-
There is...
(with difficulty) A girl.
I promise you. Angel still suffers. And he makes amends for his evil. He even saved my life.
I'm sorry. I thought-
I know, Uncle. I know...
I - I will see to it.
Buffy.
Sorry... Giles wanted me to tell you that there's been a change of plans. He wants to meet you someplace near his house. I guess he had to run home and get a book or something.
He's - very thorough.
I have my car. I can drive, if you want...
I'm not sure. Giles gave me an address. I'm just following his directions -
What?
Buffy - maybe you shouldn't.
(to herself) What is this...?
Can somebody give me a hand here?
Those creeps left this behind.
So all these parts are being brought here.
Angel.
You've got to do it. You're the only one who can protect this thing.
You're just gonna skip town for a few months?
I'll drive you to the docks.
Well that was a big zero. No box, no, vamps.
Like I could sleep, Giles.
I know. I'm worried too.
