What?
Angel!
Angel?
That's what I was going to ask you. You're okay, right?
I had this dream. Drusilla was alive. It was awful-
She killed you. Right in front of me. I saw the whole thing.
But it felt so real.
This happened before, Angel. That dream I had about  the Master... It came true.
That... Giles and I opened an office supply warehouse in Las Vegas.
Yeah. But, I mean, what if Drusilla is alive? We never saw her body.
But, what if-
Sorry. Were we talking?
I... have to get to school.
God. You feel-
Alright. This is me.
Surprise me.
This was nice. I like you first thing in the morning-
Then I like you at bed time.
I mean... You - know what I mean...  ANGEL I think so. (then) What do you mean?
That I... I like seeing you. And the part at the end of the  night when we say goodbye, it's.., getting harder.
I know. I know.  WILLOW Man. That's - I don't know, that's <u>moxie</u> or something!  BUFFY Totally unplanned. It just came out.
Yeah. I think he does. I mean, he's cool about it-
Push.
Willow. What am I going to do?
Well... <u>WANT</u> isn't always the right thing... To do, I mean. To act on want can be wrong.
But, to not act on want. You could watch your whole life pass you by-  WILLOW Carpe diem. You told me that once.
Seize the fish?
Oh. Right. (a long beat) I think we're going to... seize it, Will. Sooner or later. Once you get to a certain point - seizing is sort of inevitable.
Yeah.
Ooh, speaking of wow potential, there's Oz. What are we thinking? Any sparkage there?
Ooh, fixation on insignificant detail. Definite crush sign.
You think he's too old cuz he's a senior? Please. My boyfriend had a bicentennial.
You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up  and smell the hottie. Make a move. Do the talking thing.
You won't know unless you try. Come on, Will - seize the fish!
Rough night. I had a dream that Drusilla was alive - and she killed Angel. It really spun me. I even went by Angel's on the way to school to make sure he was okay.
Please. I didn't go over there for smootchies - (then) Well. When I found out he was okay I was relieved, and so, naturally... (then) Someone stop me.
Yeah, but... I've just got this bad feeling. This wasn't a normal dream.
I don't know. I don't want to start a big freak-out over nothing.  GILES Still. We should be on alert. If Drusilla is alive then we may be facing  a cataclysmic state of affairs-
I guess I should get gone, too.
I know. I should keep my Slayer cool  and all, but, it's Angel. Which automatically  equals maxi-wig.
Space on a mom-sponsored shopping opportunity? Not likely.
Funny you should ask - I actually woke up feeling more mature, responsible and level-headed.
And yet, true. I now possess the qualities one looks for in a licensed driver.
You said we could talk about it again when I was seventeen.
And -
I try. You know I do. But Principal Snyder has it in for me- 
It worries all moms. It's biological imperative. But I'm going to drive sooner or later, so we might as well deal sooner - right?
-and then my mom broke the plate. It was exactly like I saw it in my  dream, Giles. Every gesture. Every word. Beyond creepy.
He's fine. For now. But if part of what I had a dream about came true-
And Drusilla might be alive. (then/to Giles) In the dream, I couldn't stop her. She blind-sided me, Giles. Angel was dead before I knew what happened
That's true, except for the bread part. I guess we're one step ahead. But Giles, I'd like to stay that way.
Okay. What do I do till then?
Oh, right. Be <u>that</u> Buffy.
God. I didn't see you there.
Yeah, 'cause heaven knows there aren't enough books in the library-
Which is not to bag. It's kinda manly in an obsessive/compulsive sorta way,  don't you think?
Okay...
So - where are we headed, anyway?
We're going to the Bronze?
Uh oh.
This looks funky. Stop for a sec.
Sorry. Sacred duty, yadda, yadda, yadda
Every time I see you you're stealing something. You should talk to  somebody about this klepto issue.
There were these vamps in the alley. And one of Dru's guys was- (stops - notices) What's going on?  GILES (a bit lamely) Surprise party.
You guys did all this for me? You are so sweet!
I'm fine.
What is it?
It feels like it has some kind of release... There.
Man. That thing had major grip-
Angel?
Uh, still needing backstory here...
By Drusilla. The vamps outside were Spike's men.
What?
What about me?
Months?
But that's not months.
(to Angel) You know - those wacky, newfangled flying machines are much safer than they used to be...
When?
(pathetic) But - it's my birthday.
Okay...
When? Six months? A year? Who knows how long it will take. Or if we'll even-
Just, if you haven't noticed, someone pretty much always wants us dead.
But we don't know.
It's beautiful.
Angel-
I don't want to do this.
(small) So - don't go.
(seeing Dalton) Angel! The box!
Dru's guys ambushed us. They got the box.
She took Angel to his apartment to get clothes. I had some here.
We got wet. Giles, what do we know?
Can he be stopped? Without an army?
We need to find his weak spots. And we need to figure out where they'd be keeping him.
Good call.
Thus freeing us up for world savage.
Hello? Who is that?
No!
No! Angel!-
I think I know where Drusilla and Spike are-
We have a plan. Angel and I go to the factory to do recon. See how far they've gotten assembling the Judge. You guys fan out and check places the boxes may be coming into town. Ship yards, the airport...  We have to stop them from getting all the boxes in one place-
This thing is nasty and it's real, Giles. We don't have time to wait  for it to come get us.
Angel. Maybe I should go in alone. I mean, if my dreams are so true-
Okay - what do we do if the Judge is already put together?
We're going to have to get over this virtuous thing or we're dead meat.
Deal.
(whispering) I saw this. The party...
I'm sure our invitations just got lost in the mail-
This way-
I think we lost them-
Cold.
I - I got cut or something on my back.
Okay.
You almost went away today-
Angel. I feel, like - If I lost you... (then) But you're right. We can't be sure. About anything-
You - what?
Me too. I can't either.
Don't. Just... kiss me
