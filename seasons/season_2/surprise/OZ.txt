Hey.
Practice. The band's kind of moving towards this  new sound where we suck. So, practice.
It happens. But I'm living groupie-free nowadays. I'm clean.
I'm gonna ask you if you wanna go out tomorrow night. I'm actually kind of nervous about it. It's interesting.
It helps. It adds a comfort zone. You wanna go out tomorrow night?
I like that you're unpredictable.
That's okay.
Don't wanna crash...
All right. I'm in.
Hey.
I'm there. Feeling surprise-y. (then) Can I pick you up?
(pleased) I have your address.
Excellent.
That pretty much sums it up.
Yeah. Did everybody else see a guy turn into dust?
No, actually, it explains a lot.
(matter of fact) Looked like an arm.
(aside to Xander) I had that thought too.
