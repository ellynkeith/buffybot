And he was into it? He wants to see you at bed time, too?
Of course he is. Cause' he's cool. He would never, you know
Right. He's not the type.
What do you want to do?
True.
Not carp. Carpe. It means seize the day.
Wow.
Wow...
(glowing a bit) He's nice. I like his hands.
I don't know, though. I mean, he is a senior...
That's true, I guess... I just...
What if the talking thing becomes the awkward silence thing?
Hey.
(re: guitar case) Do you have a... a gig tonight?
I think you guys sound good. (shyly) I bet you've got a lot of groupies.
Oh.
Oh. Well, if it helps at all, I'm gonna say yes.
(remembers) I can't !
It's Buffy's birthday and we're throwing her a surprise party.
But, you could come. If you wanted.
No, that's fine. You could be my... date.
I said date...
So we're all set. I've got all the decorations. And I think Cordelia's bringing snacks and stuff.
True. (considers) Maybe...
I don't know. She's better - but she's still Cordelia. (nods to the hall) Just... look.
Example: what is the shrieking thing? They just saw each other yesterday... And now, watch - Cordelia's going to model her new outfit-
Note the reaction -  like Cordelia invented clothes. (then) They're not bad people, Xander. It's just - we are of two worlds. (can't help herself) And theirs is bad.
Hey. So - tonight?
Yeah. That would be... Here-
You do.
(distracted) Hmmm...? (then) Yeah. It's a date.
He's not just some stranger, Xander. He's a friend. He took a bullet for me.
It's happy birthday Buffy!
Not - happy birthday Buffy?
Then all of it may come true.
So much for our surprise party.
I bought little hats and everything. Oh well, I'll tell Cordelia.  GILES No, you won't. We're having a party tonight.
But Buffy and Angel - 
And anyway, Angel's coming . So she'll be able to protect him <u>and</u> have cake.
Shhh! I think I hear her coming-
Are <u>you</u> okay?
Uh, sort of...
I know it's hard to accept at first...
What - what was that?
Do what? Reassemble the Judge?
Maybe Buffy needed a few minutes to pull herself together. (then) Poor Buffy. On her birthday and everything.
You've thought way too much about this-
Xander -
We better do a round robin. Xander, you go first.
Everybody calls everybody's mom and tells them they're at everybody else's house.
And all-night keggers. (off looks) What, only Xander gets to make dumb jokes?
I can't get over how cool Oz was about all this.
You're just jealous cuz you didn't have a date for the party.
