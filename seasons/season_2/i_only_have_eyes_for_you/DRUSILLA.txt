Look. Jasmine.
Like us. (gleeful) Oooooh Angel, it's fairy-land!
Maybe I'll sleep under ground... Dig myself a little burrow.
Then I'll sleep naked. Like the animals do.
Oooooh! There's a gate... It's opening...
Ummmmm. It's black. It wants her.
The slayer. It's time, Angel. She's ready for you now. She's dancing with death.
Oh, Angel's got cattle all right. Mooooooo.
What was it, a demon?
Poor Angel...
Of course. We'll find you a nice toddler.
Want to come, pet?
