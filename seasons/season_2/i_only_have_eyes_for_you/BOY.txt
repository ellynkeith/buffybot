Come back here! We're not finished!
You don't care anymore? Is that it?
Then tell me you don't love me.
Say it!
No... A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody.
Love is forever.
I'm not afraid to use it. I swear. If I can't be with you-
Don't walk away from me, bitch!-
It's... What happened?
(desperate/baffled) This is nuts... I don't know why I - I got so mad...
We weren't. I swear to God...
I don't know. I - I don't even know where I got it.
