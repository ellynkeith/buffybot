Okay. So what's up with Buffy?
No, I mean, what's up with Buffy? Like, is she okay?
She only blew off Ben Straley - the most eligible hunk in town. He's totally rad and his father owns a department store. I mean, he's the guy I'd be going out with if I wasn't so obviously brain damaged. No offense.
Anyway. Ben told Lynette who told Charity - that Buffy wouldn't even give him the time of day.
The guilt thing's just getting a little old, you know. Everybody's told her what happened to Angel isn't her fault.
I hope you guys weren't planning on going to this Sadie Hawkins dance tonight - because I'm totally organizing a boycott. Do you realize that the girls are suppose to ask the guys - and pay and everything? I mean, who's genius idea was that?
Really. We have to nip this in the bud or things could get way scary-
Perfect. I'm going to be swollen and scarred. Why didn't it just kill me?
Are you crazy? I saw that movie. Even the priests died!
Yeah. What if this mangled triangle thingy doesn't work?
You expect me to wear that? It smells like grandpa breath!
(scared) No problem. This'll be a piece of cake.

Hey. If Sunnydale High is shut down forever, do we, like, automatically graduate?
Okay... over-identify much?
I don't get it. Is she trying to be like a big loner hero or something?
But why?
Yep. School can open again tomorrow.
I'm drawing a blank...
