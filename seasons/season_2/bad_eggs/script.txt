BUFFY: Come on, Mom, please?
JOYCE: I'm sorry, honey.
BUFFY: But... don't you understand? This is so important!
JOYCE: It's an outfit. An outfit that you may never buy.
BUFFY: But... I looked good in it!
JOYCE: You looked like a streetwalker.
BUFFY: But a thin streetwalker! (beat) That's probably not gonna be the winning argument, is it?
JOYCE: You're just too young to wear that.
BUFFY: I'm gonna be too young to wear that till I'm too old to wear that.
JOYCE: That's the plan... (looking at her watch) Oh. Stores are gonna close and I still need to order the flyers for the opening.
JOYCE: Okay, I'll go to the printers and then get our food. You go pick up my outfit from the tailors at Everyday Woman. Here's the receipt--
BUFFY: "Everyday Woman?" Why didn't you go straight to "Muumuus R Us"?
JOYCE: Do now. Make fun of your mother later.
LYLE: You know... you got about the prettiest neck I've ever seen.
BUFFY: Wow, you guys really don't ever come up with new lines, do you?
GIRL: Do you mind? We were talkin' here.
BUFFY: (to the vamp) But you promised you'd never cheat on me again, honey...
GIRL: (uncomfortable) Uh, I better go...
LYLE: I ain't done yet.
LYLE: All right then, sugarlips. I'm all yours.
LYLE: You're a rough one, ain't ya? I like that.
LYLE: (leering) A pretty little tidbit like you with so much kick... Have to be the slayer I've been hearing so much about- Lyle Gorch. Pleased to meet you.
BUFFY: Pleasure's mine.
LYLE: This ain't over, girl.
BUFFY: Oh, sure... they say they'll call...
BUFFY: Oh, bliss. Mall food.
JOYCE: Buffy.
BUFFY: Mom.
JOYCE: Where's my dress.
BUFFY: Your--? (realizing) Oh. Oh my God.
JOYCE: Buffy, what were you -- no, let me guess. You were distracted by a boy.
BUFFY: Technically.
JOYCE: Buffy...
BUFFY: Well, I'll get it --
JOYCE: They're closed. I'll have to fit it in tomorrow.
BUFFY: Sorry.
JOYCE: A little responsibility, Buffy, that's all I ask. Honestly, don't you ever think about anything besides boys and clothes?
BUFFY: Saving the world from vampires.
JOYCE: I swear, sometimes I have no idea what goes on in your head.
CORDELIA: I'm just worried that we're going to miss class-
XANDER: You know. It's really better for me if you don't talk.
CORDELIA: Well. It's really better for me with the lights off.
XANDER: Are you saying you can't look at me when we... whatever we do?
CORDELIA: It's not that I can't. It's more that I... don't want to.
XANDER: That's great. That's just dandy. We're repulsed by each other. We hide from our friends--
CORDELIA: (horrified) I should hope. Please.
XANDER: All and all. This thing is not what I'd call a self-esteem booster.
CORDELIA: Tell me about it. I mean, look at you. Where did you get those shoes?
XANDER: Okay. You know what? I don't need this.
CORDELIA: Ditto. Like a hole in the head.
WHITMORE: The sex drive in the human animal is intense--
WHITMORE: How many of us have lost countless productive hours plagued by unwanted sexual thoughts and feelings -- ?
WHITMORE: That was a rhetorical question, Mr. Harris. Not a poll.
XANDER: Oh.
WHITMORE: Of course, for teenagers such an yourselves these feelings are even more overwhelming. With all sorts of hormones surging through your bodies, compelling you to action - it's often difficult to remember that there are negative consequences to having sex. would anyone care to offer one such consequence?
CORDELIA: That depends. Are you talking about sex in a car or out of a car? Because one time - a friend of mine, not me - kicked the gear shift in a Miata that was parked at the top of this hill and--
WHITMORE: (interrupting her) I was thinking of something a little more... commonplace, Ms. Chase.
XANDER: You want to talk negative consequence? How about the heartbreak of halitosis? I mean, a girl may seem spiffy, but if she ignores her flossing, the bloom is definitely off the rose--
CORDELIA: Like that compares to kissing a guy who thinks the Hoover technique is a big turn on--
WHITMORE: Okay. Anyone--
XANDER: What about having to feign interest in her vapid, little chit-chat just to get some touch? Boot cut jeans, pro or con? Can you say - get a life!?
WHITMORE: Now? Another consequence of sexual activity? Anyone?
WHITMORE: -- else?
WILLOW: How about pregnancy? That would be a major one - right?
WHITMORE: Thank you, Ms. Rosenberg. Among teens unwanted pregnancy would be the number one negative consequence of sexual activity. This is partly because Some teens think of a baby as a toy, or as a companion who will give them love. The truth, of course, is that a child is a relentless, needy tyrant. So, as discussed last week, I've devised an exercise that may give you some idea of what an enormous burden having your own tiny charge can be--
WHITMORE: Ladies and gentlemen. I present you with your offspring. Your assignment is as follows. You will split into parenting teams. You and your partner will share equally in the daily task of "raising" your egg.
WHITMORE: Every aspect of your child's care will be recorded in this daily log. If your egg breaks - you have killed your child. Naturally, this will affect your grade. Now, please, choose a partner and pick up your children.
XANDER: (to Muffin) I know we just met, but isn't that Xander Jr. you're holding?
WILLOW: Buffy. How come you weren't in class?
BUFFY: Vampire issues. Did Mister Whitmore notice that I was tardy?
XANDER: I think the word you're searching for is 'absent'.
WILLOW: (agreeing) Tardy people show.
BUFFY: Oh. Right.
WILLOW: And, yes, he noticed. So he wanted me to give you this.
BUFFY: As punishments go, this is fairly abstract.
WILLOW: No, it's your baby.
BUFFY: Okay, I get it even less.
XANDER: You know, it's the whole "sex leads to responsibility" thing, which I really don't get. You gotta take care of the egg, it's a baby, gotta keep it safe and teach it Christian values.
WILLOW: My egg is Jewish.
XANDER: Then teach it that dreidel song.
BUFFY: God, I can't do this... I can't take care of stuff! I killed my gigapet. Literally! I sat on it and it broke.
WILLOW: You'll do fine.
XANDER: The only thing that stresses me is, when do we tell them they're adopted?
BUFFY: I'll just lay it all off on my partner. Who'd I get?
WILLOW: Well. There was an uneven number of kids - and you didn't show, so...
BUFFY: I'm a single mother?
XANDER: No man of her own...
WILLOW: At least you're not paired with Gordon the pig boy.
BUFFY: What does this say about me? That I'm doomed to live my mother's life? How deeply scary is that?
XANDER: How about this - it says nothing. It means nothing. This whole egg experiment is completely pointless--
GILES: Success at last. Your new playmate is a fellow of some repute, it seems.
BUFFY: Friendly little demons...
GILES: No, that was before they became vampires. (off their looks) The good news is, they're not among the great thinkers of our time. I doubt they're up to much; They were probably just drawn here by the hellmouth's energy.
XANDER: Enough said. I propose that Buffy slays them. All in favor?
WILLOW: (raises her hand) Aye.
BUFFY: Great. Now I have to worry about Butch and Sundance while I'm taking care of junior here.
GILES: You might need some help with those two, they are pretty -- (stops, puzzled) Why do you all have eggs?
WILLOW: (delighted) Hey. Maybe Angel could help you find the Gorches.
GILES: Good idea. You really ought to strengthen your numbers when you go up against these two.
XANDER: Oh right. I see a lot of "hunting" getting done in that scenario. Angel and Buffy. Alone. Late at night.
BUFFY: (to Xander) Please. Like Angel and I are just helpless slaves to passion. Grow up.
BUFFY: We should--
ANGEL: I know--
BUFFY: Yeah, this really isn't "hunting" in the classical sense. We should get to work.
ANGEL: You're right. Okay.
BUFFY: You see anything?
ANGEL: No.
BUFFY: Okay. Enough hunting.
TECTOR: That's the Slayer?
LYLE: Yep.
TECTOR: And ain't that Angelus with her?
LYLE: Yep.
TECTOR: Well, then, how come she's not slaying and how come he's--
LYLE: I don't know, Tector. How come you always have to ask so many damn questions?
TECTOR: (impressed) So that's Angelus. The Angelus. (then) You gonna take him, or you want me to, Lyle?
LYLE: I say we leave it. Get her when she's alone.
TECTOR: Why? You scared?
LYLE: 'Course not. I could whip both of em' right now.
TECTOR: So why don't you?
LYLE: (flaring) Listen. I got a plan. You leave the thinking to me, remember? Don't I always take care of you?
BUFFY: Alrighty then egg dude--
BUFFY: Feeding. Check. Burping. Check. Diapers. Check. (adjusts the towel around the egg) Sort of. In theory. (to egg) Okay, kid. Sweet dreams.
TECTOR: I'm tired of rat. I want something good to eat.
LYLE: We'll get you the good stuff. Just gotta be patient.
TECTOR: Why can't we stay in a nice place? A motel or something, with an ice machine.
LYLE: Gotta keep a low profile till we've taken care of this Slayer.
TECTOR: How come Angelus is gettin' all snuggly with her? Does the man have no code?
LYLE: Are you gonna pester me with questions all the damn day?
TECTOR: I just don't like it here. I'm cold, and I'm bored and there ain't a decent whore in the whole city limits.
LYLE: Well, this is the thanks I get. Don't I always look after you? Didn't I near raise you myself? Burden that you were, I shoulda left you on a doorstep when mama blew town.
TECTOR: Oh, don't say that...
LYLE: Now, I'm taking care of this. We'll hit the Slayer when she's down, when she ain't looking. Then this town is ours.
TECTOR: Are you afraid of her?
LYLE: Playing it safe, is all. We'll follow her some more. Find our time. This ain't over.
TECTOR: (schoolyard taunt) You're afraid of the Slayer...
LYLE: You want me to sit your ass down in that sunlight?
TECTOR: Think you can?
LYLE: Come on!
TECTOR: Is that all you got? Is that all you got...?
BUFFY: Oh, God...
JOYCE: At least eat something if you're going to drink that.
BUFFY: Not that hungry.
JOYCE: How goes the parenting?
BUFFY: Fine.
JOYCE: You sure your egg is secure in there?
BUFFY: Did I ask for backseat mommying?
JOYCE: Sorry. Are we a little touchy this morning?
BUFFY: I just feel all funky.
JOYCE: You don't have a temperature.
BUFFY: It's not that - I just didn't sleep well.
JOYCE: What's the matter - did your egg keep you up all night?
BUFFY: You're killing me.
BUFFY: Parenting is a pain.
JOYCE: Wait till it starts dating.
GILES: Why are you three about? Don't you have class?
WILLOW: Teen health got canceled.
XANDER: Mr. Whitmore's out today - couldn't get an egg-sitter or something.
GILES: Well, then could you give me a hand?
WILLOW: No.
GILES: How did the hunt go last night, Buffy?
BUFFY: No go.
GILES: You didn't go, or you were unsuccessful?
BUFFY: No Gorches.
XANDER: Apparently, Buffy has decided that the problem with the English language is all those pesky words. (to Buffy) You. Angel. Big. Smoochies?
BUFFY: Shut. Up.
GILES: It's true. You and Willow do appear to be awfully sluggish. Are you quite sure you're alright?
WILLOW: Maybe it was something we ate...
XANDER: Or perhaps it's the burden of parenthood. Notice how seriously both of you have taken this egg thing - while I, in turn, chose a more balanced approach--
WILLOW: Xander. Maybe you shouldn't--
XANDER: See? That's just what I'm talking about. You can't stress over every little thing. A child picks up on that - which is a one-way ticket to neurotic city--
WILLOW: It didn't break! (then) Why didn't it break?
XANDER: That's the other secret to conscientious egg-care. A pot of scalding water and about eight minutes.
WILLOW: You BOILED your young?
XANDER: I know it sounds harsh. But sometimes you have to be harsh to be kind. You can bet little Xander here in thick-skinned now--
GILES: Technically, that would be called cheating, yes?
XANDER: No! It's just like taking a shortcut, you know, if you're running a race.
BUFFY: That would also be cheating.
WILLOW: You should be ashamed.
GILES: I suppose there is a sort of machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression...
XANDER: I resent that!... Or, possibly, thank you...
GILES: Bit of both would suit.
CORDELIA: Figures, you three are all hanging in the dungeon while something major is going on at Sunnydale High.
XANDER: And what would that be, Cordelia? Barrette appreciation day?
CORDELIA: Mr. Whitmore didn't show today.
BUFFY: That news is of the past.
CORDELIA: He can't be reached. He's missing. And presumed dead.
GILES: Presumed by whom?
CORDELIA: Well, me.
GILES: I think we might wait a few hours before we give up on him completely.
CORDELIA: Well I think we should look around. Don't you, Xander?
XANDER: It can wait.
BUFFY: You're awfully gung-ho.
CORDELIA: (to Xander) Well, his body could fall out of a closet somewhere. We should check every closet to see if he's in a closet.
XANDER: Of course. There could be a closet... Let's go.
XANDER: You guys look for other clues. We'll meet back here.
BUFFY: (no intention of stirring) We'll get right on that.
WILLOW: (watches them leave) Are they getting weirder? Have you noticed the weirdness of them?
BUFFY: I don't know. Should we be having guilt about not looking for Mr. Whitmore?
GILES: I think you can hold off on that. I'd prefer you save your strength for hunting the Gorches.
BUFFY: Yeah, I'll be fine by tonight. Maybe sweep the cemetery.
GILES: Be careful. If you're still feeling sluggish --
BUFFY: No worries.
WILLOW: And you've got Angel helping you, right?
BUFFY: Yeah, he, uh... does what he can.
BUFFY: As much as I hate to say this - we should go kill bad guys.
ANGEL: It's late. You should get home.
BUFFY: What about the Gorches?
ANGEL: I'll hunt.
BUFFY: Really? You'd do that?
ANGEL: It's not like I have an early day tomorrow.
BUFFY: True. And I still have to go home and fill out my egg diary.
ANGEL: Your - what?
BUFFY: I told you. That faux parenting gig I'm doing in school. (then) Like I'm really planning to have kids any time soon. Someday, when I'm done having a life maybe. A kid would be too much to deal with now.
ANGEL: I wouldn't know. (then/carefully) I don't... Well, you know, I can't.
BUFFY: Oh. (then/re-grouping) Well, it's totally okay. I figured there are all kinds of things vampires can't do like, you know, work for the telephone company, volunteer for the red cross. Have little vampires...
ANGEL: (skeptical) So you don't think about the future.
BUFFY: No.
ANGEL: Never.
BUFFY: No.
ANGEL: How can you say that? You're not like me. You could have a normal life. (off her look) You know what I mean. Less not normal. You really don't care what happens a year from now? Five years from now -- ?
BUFFY: I - I can't care. (with difficulty) Angel. when I try to look into the future, all I can see... is you--
ANGEL: (pained) Buffy--
BUFFY: And I don't have a choice. Don't you know that? If I could do the logic thing, you think I would even be here? (then) All I can see is you... All I want is you.
ANGEL: (quietly) I know the feeling.
BUFFY: Yuck.
BUFFY: Come on, pick up.
WILLOW: Hello?
BUFFY: Willow. Are you okay?
WILLOW: Why shouldn't I be?
BUFFY: Your egg. Is it doing anything?
WILLOW: Doing what?
BUFFY: Break it. Right now. Smash it with something heavy.
WILLOW: Buffy, what--
BUFFY: My egg just went postal on me. It hatched - some kind of crawly monster thing jumped on me-
WILLOW: Are you okay?
BUFFY: Yeah, but your egg--
WILLOW: It's totally normal. I put it in the fridge.
BUFFY: Okay...
WILLOW: Maybe it was a trap. Something the Gorch brothers planted for you.
BUFFY: Maybe... (pulls it together) Okay. I'm sorry to wake you. Get back to sleep.
WILLOW: You sure?
BUFFY: Yeah. I'm better. I'm fine.
WILLOW: Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
JOYCE: (entering) Buffy, who are you talking to at this...
JOYCE: Why are you dressed? Where exactly do you think you're going at three o'clock in the morning?
BUFFY: Nowhere --
JOYCE: Who was that on the phone?
BUFFY: It was Willow... I just called 'cause she wasn't feeling well and I was worried.
JOYCE: You're gonna have to do better than that, young lady.
BUFFY: I... had a bad dream...
JOYCE: No, you're about to have a bad dream. A dream that you're grounded for the rest of your natural life --
JOYCE: ...which means no after-school socializing. No Bronze. No nothing, not until I give you the say so. Do you understand?
BUFFY: Yes. But--
JOYCE: Yes or no. That's all I want to hear from you.
JOYCE: Now. School ends at 2:30. I want you to go to the library at 2:33 and study until I pick you up there at 5:30. Understood?
BUFFY: Yes.
JOYCE: Good. Have a nice day.
BUFFY: Nice bear. Listen, is your --
CORDELIA: I'll have you know my father brought this back for me from Gstaad years ago. Then all of a sudden these trendoids everywhere are sporting them. So I've been totally not wearing it. But then I was - "Hey! I started this whole nation-wide craze. What am I ashamed of?"
BUFFY: Okay, soliloquy girl... I just wanted to know about your egg.
CORDELIA: My egg?
BUFFY: You know the egg that Mr. Whitmore gave to you?
CORDELIA: I've got it in my bear. I'm going to ace this experiment. No sweat. You think keeping an egg intact for a week is effortful? Try not breaking a silk-wrapped nail.
BUFFY: And your egg isn't acting... odd or anything?
CORDELIA: It's not "acting" anything. It's an egg, Buffy. It doesn't emote.
XANDER: Ummmm. Card-boardy.
XANDER: (to egg) Sorry, Junior. A man's gotta eat.
BUFFY: Sorry about calling you so late last night.
WILLOW: That's okay. I was awake.
BUFFY: What were you doing up?
WILLOW: Just couldn't sleep, I guess. (then) So, was there any more "hatchling" activity last night?
BUFFY: No.I think you may be right. My egg may have been some kind of booby trap the vamps laid for me. So far, it seems like everybody else's are normal.
WILLOW: You didn't bring the "thing" that attacked you, did you?
BUFFY: Yeah. I called Giles and he's in research mode. Wants to see it.
WILLOW: Well, take it to the science lab. I'll get Giles and we can analyze it.
BUFFY: Great. I always say - a day without an autopsy is like a day without sunshine...
XANDER: Can I just say-- (he shudders) Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
BUFFY: I see your uhhhhhhhhhhh and raise You a gnyeh.
CORDELIA: What is it?
XANDER: We don't know what it is, Cordelia. That's why we're here. Capiche?
CORDELIA: Capiche? Like you're Mr. World Traveler.
BUFFY: Where's Giles? I know he'd hate to miss this.
WILLOW: He said we should get started and he'd be by as soon as possible.
XANDER: So. Okay. Get started Buffy. Dissect it or something.
BUFFY: Dissect it? Why me?
XANDER: You're the Slayer.
BUFFY: I slayed! My work here in done.
XANDER: Oh no. I almost ate one of these things. I've fulfilled my gross-out quota for the decade.
WILLOW: Guys?
XANDER: Do we have any idea what to look for? I mean, how are we supposed to figure out what this thing is?
BUFFY: Turn it over. Maybe we missed its I.D. bracelet.
XANDER: So now I guess we know what happened to Mr. Whitmore.
CORDELIA: He saw one of these things and ran away?
BUFFY: Try - best case scenario.
WILLOW: It's possible that Mr. Whitmore wasn't harmed. Maybe the offspring simply used him to return to the mother Bezoar.
XANDER: Yeah. Maybe he-- (then/to willow) What?
BUFFY: What's a Bezo--
BUFFY: Hey!
XANDER: Cordy! What--
JOYCE: Buffy? Hello?
GILES: Hello.
JOYCE: Mr. Giles, hello. I was looking for Buffy. She was supposed to wait for me here.
GILES: She's not been in. I was waiting to talk to her about history texts.
JOYCE: Well, that is just the last straw.
GILES: I'm sure she didn't mean to --
JOYCE: She never means to, but somehow she always manages to anyway. Do you have children, Mr. Giles? (sudden cringe) Should I be whispering?
GILES: No, and no I haven't any children. Although sometimes I feel as though I do. Working here.
JOYCE: They can be such a -- I don't want to say burden, but... actually, I kind of do want to say burden.
GILES: Feel free.
JOYCE: Burden. Thank you. They're just so irresponsible.
GILES: Sometimes...
JOYCE: "Bristow's Demon Index"? "Hell's Offspring"?
GILES: Hobby of mine. But not having to do with Buffy in any way.
GILES: Buffy told you she'd be here? All afternoon?
JOYCE: Well, yes... is something wrong?
GILES: I'm sure it's nothing...
GILES: What was that?
JOYCE: (turning to the door) Probably the janitor...
BUFFY: Xander?
BUFFY: Are you okay?
XANDER: Man, the last time Cordy dragged me in here was a lot nicer...
BUFFY: What?
XANDER: Uh, nothing. Crazy talk. Head trauma.
BUFFY: (feels her head) Yeah, I'm gonna have a bump...
XANDER: (feeling his) I'm gonna have a peninsula here. What the hell is going on? Cordy, and Willow...
BUFFY: (rising) Something to do with our hatchlings, I'm sure of that.
XANDER: What are they, possessed?
BUFFY: I don't know. They sure wanted us out of the way.
XANDER: Why not kill us? Why drag us in here -- oh.
XANDER: (small voice) Bad now.
XANDER: (schwarzeneggar) You're scrambled.
XANDER: See, we make a great team. You kill, I pun.
BUFFY: Giles?
XANDER: Giles! He must be out somewhere.
BUFFY: He picked a hell of a time to get a life.
XANDER: What do we do?
BUFFY: We can't fight these things unless we know something about them.
XANDER: Willow said something... a name... what was it?
BUFFY: A Bozo! Not a bozo.
XANDER: Bezoar.
BUFFY: Yes! Great. Okay, so, we look it up.
XANDER: In what?
BUFFY: A book?
BUFFY: Giles said he was gonna try to find something.
BUFFY: Okay, I'd say he found something.
XANDER: I'd say something found him.
BUFFY: A pre-prehistoric parasite... the mother hibernates underground, laying eggs. Offspring attach themselves to a host, taking control of their motor functions through neural clamping.
XANDER: Neural clamping? That sounds skippable.
BUFFY: So our people are taking orders from the mama Bezoar. Which begs the question --
XANDER: What does mommy want?
BUFFY: Are you all right?
JOHNATHAN: Yes, I'm fine. I slipped.
BUFFY: I think I hear mommy calling...
XANDER: Do we really wanna go in there?
BUFFY: We really don't.
XANDER: What are they digging up?
BUFFY: Oh, boy...
BUFFY: We can't let them spread those things.
XANDER: I know. I'll handle it. Can you hold the fort? Better yet -- can you kill the fort?
BUFFY: I'll try.
BUFFY: I'm gonna need a weapon. I'm gonna need a big weapon.
LYLE: Told you it wasn't over.
TECTOR: She's so cute and little. (turns to Lyle) Can we keep her?
BUFFY: Guys, this is not a great time.
LYLE: It's gonna be.
LYLE: What the hell is this?
BUFFY: Mom?
WILLOW: Kill them.
LYLE: What's going on?
BUFFY: Long story!
XANDER: Cordelia, I don't want to hurt you... some of the time...
XANDER: Ow! That's my bump!
XANDER: Sorry...
TECTOR: Where is that sorry-ass girl?
TECTOR: What is that....?
LYLE: Tector! TECTOR!
LYLE: This is all your fault!
BUFFY: How?
LYLE: Okay, it's over now...
GILES: Yes, it was a gas leak, just get some air and you'll all be fine... (to Xander) What really happened?
XANDER: Go with Gas leak. I'll fill you in later.
XANDER: How're you guys doing?
WILLOW: Did I really hit you?
XANDER: Knocked me out.
CORDELIA: Did I hit you?.
XANDER: Yes, everybody hit me.
CORDELIA: Oh, good. I mean, not good that I hit you, but... I didn't want to be left out.
BUFFY: Is she all right?
XANDER: Fine. Little confused. It's going around.
BUFFY: Hey, mom, are you doing okay?
JOYCE: Buffy! I was worried you might have gotten caught in the building. There was a gas leak.
BUFFY: I just heard. I was working out. In the gym.
JOYCE: I went looking for you in the library.
BUFFY: Oh, yeah, well, I was gonna be there but --
JOYCE: I thought I made it pretty clear you weren't to leave the library till I arrived.
BUFFY: True, but the other side of that is --
JOYCE: I'm not really interested in the other side right now. You have got to learn some responsibility, young lady. Once and for all.
BUFFY: I'm grounded?
JOYCE: You're already grounded.
BUFFY: Oh yeah.
JOYCE: Until further notice, you're confined to your room. You will not leave your room at any time except to go to school or the bathroom. Your meals will be brought to you -- and they will not be very good. Am I making myself clear?
BUFFY: You're clear. I'll stay in my room.
JOYCE: Damn right you will.
ANGEL: You sure you're not gonna get in trouble?
BUFFY: Hey, I earned this. Besides, I'm not breaking any rules.
BUFFY: In a minute, mom...
