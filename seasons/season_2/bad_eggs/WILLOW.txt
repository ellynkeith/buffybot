How about pregnancy? That would be a major one - right?
Buffy. How come you weren't in class?
(agreeing) Tardy people show.
And, yes, he noticed. So he wanted me to give you this.
No, it's your baby.
My egg is Jewish.
You'll do fine.
Well. There was an uneven number of kids - and you didn't show, so...
At least you're not paired with Gordon the pig boy.
(raises her hand) Aye.
(delighted) Hey. Maybe Angel could help you find the Gorches.
Teen health got canceled.
No.
Maybe it was something we ate...
Xander. Maybe you shouldn't--
It didn't break! (then) Why didn't it break?
You BOILED your young?
You should be ashamed.
(watches them leave) Are they getting weirder? Have you noticed the weirdness of them?
And you've got Angel helping you, right?
Hello?
Why shouldn't I be?
Doing what?
Buffy, what--
Are you okay?
It's totally normal. I put it in the fridge.
Maybe it was a trap. Something the Gorch brothers planted for you.
You sure?
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
That's okay. I was awake.
Just couldn't sleep, I guess. (then) So, was there any more "hatchling" activity last night?
You didn't bring the "thing" that attacked you, did you?
Well, take it to the science lab. I'll get Giles and we can analyze it.
He said we should get started and he'd be by as soon as possible.
Guys?
It's possible that Mr. Whitmore wasn't harmed. Maybe the offspring simply used him to return to the mother Bezoar.
Kill them.
Did I really hit you?
