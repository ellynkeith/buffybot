You know. It's really better for me if you don't talk.
Are you saying you can't look at me when we... whatever we do?
That's great. That's just dandy. We're repulsed by each other. We hide from our friends--
All and all. This thing is not what I'd call a self-esteem booster.
Okay. You know what? I don't need this.
Oh.
You want to talk negative consequence? How about the heartbreak of halitosis? I mean, a girl may seem spiffy, but if she ignores her flossing, the bloom is definitely off the rose--
What about having to feign interest in her vapid, little chit-chat just to get some touch? Boot cut jeans, pro or con? Can you say - get a life!?
(to Muffin) I know we just met, but isn't that Xander Jr. you're holding?
I think the word you're searching for is 'absent'.
You know, it's the whole "sex leads to responsibility" thing, which I really don't get. You gotta take care of the egg, it's a baby, gotta keep it safe and teach it Christian values.
Then teach it that dreidel song.
The only thing that stresses me is, when do we tell them they're adopted?
No man of her own...
How about this - it says nothing. It means nothing. This whole egg experiment is completely pointless--
Enough said. I propose that Buffy slays them. All in favor?
Oh right. I see a lot of "hunting" getting done in that scenario. Angel and Buffy. Alone. Late at night.
Mr. Whitmore's out today - couldn't get an egg-sitter or something.
Apparently, Buffy has decided that the problem with the English language is all those pesky words. (to Buffy) You. Angel. Big. Smoochies?
Or perhaps it's the burden of parenthood. Notice how seriously both of you have taken this egg thing - while I, in turn, chose a more balanced approach--
See? That's just what I'm talking about. You can't stress over every little thing. A child picks up on that - which is a one-way ticket to neurotic city--
That's the other secret to conscientious egg-care. A pot of scalding water and about eight minutes.
I know it sounds harsh. But sometimes you have to be harsh to be kind. You can bet little Xander here in thick-skinned now--
No! It's just like taking a shortcut, you know, if you're running a race.
I resent that!... Or, possibly, thank you...
And what would that be, Cordelia? Barrette appreciation day?
It can wait.
Of course. There could be a closet... Let's go.
You guys look for other clues. We'll meet back here.
Ummmm. Card-boardy.
(to egg) Sorry, Junior. A man's gotta eat.
Can I just say-- (he shudders) Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
We don't know what it is, Cordelia. That's why we're here. Capiche?
So. Okay. Get started Buffy. Dissect it or something.
You're the Slayer.
Oh no. I almost ate one of these things. I've fulfilled my gross-out quota for the decade.
Do we have any idea what to look for? I mean, how are we supposed to figure out what this thing is?
So now I guess we know what happened to Mr. Whitmore.
Yeah. Maybe he-- (then/to willow) What?
Cordy! What--
Man, the last time Cordy dragged me in here was a lot nicer...
Uh, nothing. Crazy talk. Head trauma.
(feeling his) I'm gonna have a peninsula here. What the hell is going on? Cordy, and Willow...
What are they, possessed?
Why not kill us? Why drag us in here -- oh.
(small voice) Bad now.
(schwarzeneggar) You're scrambled.
See, we make a great team. You kill, I pun.
Giles! He must be out somewhere.
What do we do?
Willow said something... a name... what was it?
Bezoar.
In what?
I'd say something found him.
Neural clamping? That sounds skippable.
What does mommy want?
Do we really wanna go in there?
What are they digging up?
I know. I'll handle it. Can you hold the fort? Better yet -- can you kill the fort?
Cordelia, I don't want to hurt you... some of the time...
Ow! That's my bump!
Sorry...
Go with Gas leak. I'll fill you in later.
How're you guys doing?
Knocked me out.
Yes, everybody hit me.
Fine. Little confused. It's going around.
