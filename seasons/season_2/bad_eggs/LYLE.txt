You know... you got about the prettiest neck I've ever seen.
I ain't done yet.
All right then, sugarlips. I'm all yours.
You're a rough one, ain't ya? I like that.
(leering) A pretty little tidbit like you with so much kick... Have to be the slayer I've been hearing so much about- Lyle Gorch. Pleased to meet you.
This ain't over, girl.
Yep.
Yep.
I don't know, Tector. How come you always have to ask so many damn questions?
I say we leave it. Get her when she's alone.
'Course not. I could whip both of em' right now.
(flaring) Listen. I got a plan. You leave the thinking to me, remember? Don't I always take care of you?
We'll get you the good stuff. Just gotta be patient.
Gotta keep a low profile till we've taken care of this Slayer.
Are you gonna pester me with questions all the damn day?
Well, this is the thanks I get. Don't I always look after you? Didn't I near raise you myself? Burden that you were, I shoulda left you on a doorstep when mama blew town.
Now, I'm taking care of this. We'll hit the Slayer when she's down, when she ain't looking. Then this town is ours.
Playing it safe, is all. We'll follow her some more. Find our time. This ain't over.
You want me to sit your ass down in that sunlight?
Come on!
Told you it wasn't over.
It's gonna be.
What the hell is this?
What's going on?
Tector! TECTOR!
This is all your fault!
Okay, it's over now...
