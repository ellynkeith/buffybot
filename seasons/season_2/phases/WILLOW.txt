Hi.
Whatcha looking at?
So, did you like the movie last night?
Yeah, it was good. And I had a really  fun time at the rest. I mean, the part  with you.
Mine, too.
Nowhere! I mean, he said he was gonna  wait till I was ready, but… I'm ready! Honest. I'm good to go here.
It is nice. He's great. We have a lot of  fun. But I want some smootchies.
I've dropped anvils.
At last count? All of them. Maybe more.
But I want Oz to get an 'A.' And,  ooh, one of those gold stars.
Well he better hurry. I don't want to be the only girl in school without a real boyfriend.
How are you holding up, anyway.
(encouraging) Well, there you go!
Great! I'll call Xander, ask him to join  us. What's his number? Oh, yeah:  '1-800-I'm-Dating-A-Skanky-Ho.'
Really? Thanks! I've never gotten a  'me-ow' before.
Darn tootin'! I'm just saying, Xander  and Cordelia? What does he see in  her anyway?
Ohh… you mean bunnies and stuff? (then) No, don't tell me.
Yeah.
What about <u>tonight's</u> full moon?
Last night was the night before the  full moon. Traditionally known as… the night before the full moon.
(leaning in) Looks like it healed already.
Don't forget, you're supposed to be  a meek little girlie-girl like the rest  of us.
Oh, I think you pushed your way to  the front long before this.
Well, maybe some people could see  better if you weren't standing on the  auction block, shaking your wares.
You could be the girl next door, too. If  Xander lived next to a brothel!
Quite the party animal.
'Cause it'll be night soon.
I sometimes feel like that.
His 'Do I smell something?' look.
He's so busy looking around at  everything he doesn't have that he  doesn't even realize what he does have.
I'm not sure I do. Right now, Oz and I  are in some sort of holding pattern. Only without the holding. Or anything else.
Yeah. Him and Xander. Guys.
A couple of guys.
The werewolf! It's in there!
No, we're fine.
The way werewolves always do.
On account of how you were once a hyena.
Before we knew you.
Are you okay?
You kind of knew Theresa.
It is. But we can do stuff to help.  Sometimes it feels good to help.
Like, looking up names? I'll be doing that most of the night. You could help me help together-
(taken aback) Oh. So….
There is one name that keeps getting spit  out. Aggressive behavior, run-ins with  authorities, about a handful of violent  incidents…
They say it's a good idea to count to ten when you're angry…
I'll keep looking.
Yeah. Oz wanted to be somewhere that was away. From me.
I can't figure him out. He's so hot and cold. Or, lukewarm and cold.
That doesn't sound like a good trade.
That doesn't make me a slut?
It used to be so much easier to tell if a  boy liked you. He'd punch you on the  arm, then run back to his friends.
I'll see you guys later. Cordelia asked me to look over her history homework before class. I think that means I might have to do it.
Okay, I had this whole thing worked  out and I had written it down, but then it didn't make any sense when I was  reading it back.
I mean, what am I supposed to think?  First you buy me popcorn, then you put  the tag in my shirt, and then you're all  glad I didn't get bit. But I guess none  of that means anything, because instead  of looking up names with me, here you  are all alone in your house doing nothing  by yourself.
No, darn it, we will talk about this now! Buffy told me that sometimes what the  girl makes has to be the first move and  now that I'm saying this I'm starting to  think that the written version sounded  pretty good but you know what I mean!
Well, welcome to the world! Things happen. You don't think I'm going through a lot?
Oh, so now you're special! You're  special boy-
Oz?
It's Oz! It's Oz!
The werewolf!
Can't you just trust me on this?! (distraught) He… he said he was going through all these changes, and then he went through all these… changes.
In the woods.
Go where? You're not going to kill Oz?! I mean, sure, he's a werewolf. But I bet  he doesn't mean to be!
Careful!
(disbelieving) I shot Oz…
(to Giles) Is he going to be all right?
Hey.
Did you want to go first?
I'm sorry about how all this ended up. With me shooting you, and all.
That's okay.
Yeah. It's a complication.
What?
I don't know. I'm kind of okay with you being in my way.
Well, I like you. You're nice, and you're  funny and you don't smoke, and okay, werewolf but that's not all the time. I  mean, three days out of the month <u>I'm</u>  not much fun to be around, either.
So I'd still if you'd still.
Okay.
