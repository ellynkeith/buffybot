That's what I was going to say.
This cheerleader trophy. It's like its eyes follow you wherever you go.
I don't know. Today's movies are kind of like popcorn. You forget about them  as soon as they're done. I do remember  I liked the popcorn, though.
That's great, because my time was  also of the good.
I'll see you, then. Later.
Good job, Larry. You've really mastered the single entendre.
Yeah, she's actually an evil Mastermind. It's fun.
Seems wise.
(to Willow) Don't worry. They may not look it,  but bunnies can really take care of  themselves.
(explaining) Tag.
I been there, man.
The emotional scar is still there.
That works, too.
Whoa.
(into phone) Hey, Aunt Maureen? It's me…  What…?
Killed what?
Is everyone okay? Was anyone  scratched? Or bitten?
Gladness.
'Got' as in…
(news to him) Another night?
(taking this in) Hunh…
But there's really no way to tell who it is. Right?
Xander was…?
Still, that doesn't necessarily mean-
What?
Yeah. I'm trying not to think about  it. It's… a lot.
Uh-huh.
I can't. I'm… busy.
I, uh, I need to go.
Willow, what are you doing--?
This really isn't a good time.
Willow, we will talk about this tomorrow. I promise.
I know. It's me. I'm going though some… changes.
Not like I am.
Willow, please-
Hey.
I spoke to Giles. He said I'll be okay, I'll just have to lock myself up around the full moon. Only he used more  words than that. And a globe.
That's okay. I'm sorry I almost ate you.
I didn't know what to say. It's not every day you find out you're a werewolf.  That's fairly freaksome. May take a  couple days getting used to.
So I guess, maybe, it'd be best if I just sort of…
You know, stayed out of your way  for a while.
(taking this in) You mean… you'd still…
You are quite the human.
I'd still. I'd very still.
Agreed.
