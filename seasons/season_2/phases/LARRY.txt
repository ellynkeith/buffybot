Man, Oz, I would love to get me some  of that Buffy and Willow action, if you  know what I mean.
Oops.
She's gotta be putting out, or what's  the point? What are you gonna do,  talk? Come on, fess up - how far have you got?
Ah, last week some huge dog jumped  out of the bushes and bit me. Thirty-nine  stitches. They ought to shoot those strays.
Theresa, be still my shorts. We're in  the same group. (smiling cruelly) I may have to attack you.
You're turning me on, Summers.
Harris. Geez, next time wear a bell.
Geeks make me nervous.
I could hide my fist in your face.
(calmly) You know, Harris, that nosey-nose of yours is going to get you into trouble some day. Like today.
All right, what do you want? Hush  money? Is that what you're after?
(skeptically) You want to help. What, you think you have a cure?
(incredulous) Sure, that's easy for you to say. You're  nobody. But I've got a reputation.
If this gets out, it's over for me. Forget  about playing football; they'll run me  out of town. I mean, come on. How do  you think people are going to look at me  once they find out I'm gay?
I can't believe it. I mean, that was almost easy. I… I never felt like I could tell  anyone. And then you, of all people,  bring it out of me.
No. Because knowing you went through  the same thing made it easier for me to  admit it.
It's ironic. All those times I beat the crap out of you, it must have been because I recognized something in you that I didn't want to believe about myself.
Oh, of course. Don't worry. I wouldn't do that to you. (leans in; sincerely) Your secret's safe with me.
Let me get those.
I know. It's just, well…
