Soon it will be upon us, a day which has been spoken of for thousands of years.
I bestow each of you with a noble distinction, for you will take part in this wonderful victory.
Amongst the living, there will shortly be arriving a significant assemblage of souls.
One of these will have a greater impact on our purpose than any who have come before. You must make him one of us tonight so that tomorrow he can descend and fulfill his destiny.
For it is written, â€˜Seven will rise and one will live... to free the Master.'
You have done excellent work.
Everything is happening as was foretold. But there is one final task you must perform.
It has been presaged that the special one will bring with him strengths and powers drawn from the deepest darkness. Deliver him to me as soon as he has risen.
I am very pleased. Your arrival has been eagerly  anticipated. You are gifted in way of which you are  yet unaware, and with your help I will finally be free. Welcome.
