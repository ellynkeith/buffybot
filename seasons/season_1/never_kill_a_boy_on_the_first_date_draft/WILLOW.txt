You luck.
He was all over you.
Please. There was definite hip-to-hip contact.
He's all alone.
But who?
Looks like it.
(babbling) I took algebra last year because I'm a year ahead, so now I'm taking pre-calculus which is really hard, but I'm in the gifted class, well, my parents signed me up for it, how embarrassing is that, and maybe I should get a janitor to take care of this mess. (as she goes off) Clean up on aisle seven!
I guess I blew it way out of proportion.
I missed that. I was too busy looking down and to the left of his 501 label.
What's wrong?
Already? Seems like just last week was the 1,000th day after the last Septugian Sunset. Where does the time go?
Pick.
(handing Buffy some clothes) Put this on.
So, where's the taking you?
Well, I read somewhere that sometimes they go to movies.
Uh, Chambers--
Xander...
This is bad.
We're going to have to take steps.
Xander, we have to go with Giles. He could get into trouble.
Buffy, I'm glad we caught you.
Oh, yeah. Going on nine days now.  We knew it would happen eventually and figured, hey, why fight it?
(whispering to Xander) Yeah. We'd better make out.
Come on. We can go... some place.  We can do... some things. It'll be a blast!
(deliberately) Giles is there.
Buffy, we really need to get there.
(to Xander) I'm still thinking it would help if we make out.
(to Chambers; covering) She likes to make an entrance.
Probably PCP.
These are shallots.
Buffy...
(to Xander) Then we should probably make out.
You mean specifically about you?
But he was pretty incoherent, so maybe we missed it.
(to Xander) I think this is our stop.
