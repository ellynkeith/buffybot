LOOK OUT! It's gotten loose!
STOP THE BEAST!
Good work, Bobby.
Naughty little Herbert, gave Mr. Flutie quite a scare, didn't he?
Students, I'd like you all the meet Herbert, our new  mascot for the Sunnydale High Razorbacks!
Oh, no no no, it's a Razorback -- See, here are the tusks, and... a scary... razor back.
Well, what do you expect when you only raise $23.48 at the Mascot Car Wash. You're just lucky my Uncle Merle owns a farm.
Here you go, young man. I'll give you the honor of  returning him to his pen -- our Ragin' Razorback!
