BUFFY: (nudges Xander) What's with the spaceage?
XANDER: First field trip, huh?
BUFFY: Maybe it's non-obvious, but wouldn't our trip to the Zoo be a teensy bit more comfortable if... one of us  sat in the back?
WILLOW: (shakes head) Reserved for cool people. (confessional) That's why we're in the front.
XANDER: (off Buffy's confusion) Those are the "So-shes." Also known as the "Hotsnots," the "Attack Pack"...
BUFFY: So what do they do?
XANDER: They're not like jocks or cheerleaders where they  actually do something --
WILLOW: People just want to hang with them.
BUFFY: Oh -- sort of our version of the Royal Family.
WILLOW: Worse. They have self-confidence. It's like they know  they're in, and anyone who's not them is, by  definition, out.
KYLE: Hey, Lance -- you look uncomfortable. Join us.
KYLE: (friendly) You know, Lance, for lunch, I'm thinking pepperoni pizza. You like greasy food, Lance?
LANCE: Oh, thanks Kyle, but my dermatologist wants me to lay off greasy foods.
RHONDA: Oh riiight, your skin. That must be horrible. Do you  get it on your back, too?
BUFFY: They're being nice to Lance.
XANDER: (knows better) You know at Marineland -- how Shamu and the other  Killer Whales like to play with bouncy red balls?
BUFFY: (getting it) Lance is now a bouncy red ball.
XANDER: (ominous) Count on it.
VIDEO: ...Nowhere are hierarchies and cruel pecking orders more pronounced than in the Animal Kingdom...
VIDEO: ...And perhaps no animals are more cruel than the  Hyenas, who taunt and wound their victims before going  in the for the kill...
VIDEO: ...Their powerful jaws tear flesh, and crush bones to powder, all the while emitting the Hyena's hideous laughter...
KYLE: (laughing) C'mon Lance, let's check 'em out.
VIDEO: ...Hyenas mark their territory by secreting a smelly  paste from glands in their hindquarters...
BUFFY: (to The Five) Enjoy. You guys should have a lot in common.
ZOOKEEPER: Are you illiterate, or do you just have bad eyesight?  Because Hyenas are quick to prey on the weak.
RHONDA: Why can't we go in there?
ZOOKEEPER: Quarantine. They just came from Africa. So keep out.
ZOOKEEPER: ...Even if they call your name.
BUFFY: What're you talking about?
ZOOKEEPER: A Masai tribesman once told me that Hyenas can understand human speech. They follow humans by day, learning their names. At night, when the campfire has died, they call out to  the person. And once that person is separated... (beat; for effect) ...the pack devours him.
KYLE: Nice hat.
KYLE: Pretty fun, huh Lance? (mocking) I hope they don't call our names --
KYLE: Hy-eeena -- I'm Kyyyyle...
KYLE: What's wrong, Laaaance -- they just want to learn your name.
LANCE: Okay -- I think they know it now...
LANCE: Owwwww --
XANDER: So tonight, you guys Bronze-bound?
WILLOW: Didn't you get enough "crowded and sweaty" at the Zoo?
BUFFY: Yeah, that Reptile House was definitely working the not-so-fresh motif.
RHONDA: Hey, Bobby -- wanna go to the Bronze with us tonight?
BOBBY: Really -- me?
KYLE: (friendly) Yeah, get there early and save us the table by the stage.
BOBBY: But that means I'd have to get there by six thir... okay, thanks.
BUFFY: (re: Bobby) Guess Shamu's found a new red rubber ball.
RHONDA: Sorry, Lance.
LANCE: But... before...
KYLE: Lance, look around. There's us -  then there's you.
RHONDA: (singing) "One of these things/ Doesn't belong here..."
KYLE: Oh yea -- see? It's the telephone pole with acne.
WILLOW: That is so not okay.
WILLOW: We're not really welcome to sit there -  those are the jocks... (pointing) Those are the Grungers... the Gear-heads...
BUFFY: Never realized the Bronze is so much like the Zoo --  except without the helpful educational videos.
WILLOW: When Xander gets here, we'll be three and have our group.
BUFFY: Guess now our group's got four.
WILLOW: I thought you didn't know Suzy Peterson?
XANDER: I don't. (off them) But tonight... I just feel so alive, so confident -- I doubt any woman could deny...
XANDER: --My animal magnetism.
BUFFY: (pushes him away) Have you been drinking your cologne?
RHONDA: Bobby -- let's play Psychic Hotline. You try to guess why we're talking to you.
BOBBY: Cause I got here at 6:30 like you asked, to save the table for us?
KYLE: Us? You hang with us?
RHONDA: Shouldn't you be hovering over a football stadium with a "GOODYEAR" written on you?
RHONDA: This tables munches.
KYLE: (no big deal) We'll check out the view.
XANDER: ...All my high school life, I've stood against the wall, one foot tucked under my butt, silently mouthing "I love you" to every girl passing me by. But tonight...
XANDER: --It's different -- I feel different -- (leans closer) It's like I see better, hear better, smell better... taste better --
BUFFY: (pushing away) When did you become Peppy Le Pew?
WILLOW: Uh-oh -- here come the winged monkeys.
FLUTIE: LOOK OUT! It's gotten loose!
FLUTIE: STOP THE BEAST!
FLUTIE: Good work, Bobby.
FLUTIE: Naughty little Herbert, gave Mr. Flutie quite a scare, didn't he?
FLUTIE: Students, I'd like you all the meet Herbert, our new  mascot for the Sunnydale High Razorbacks!
BUFFY: It's a pig.
FLUTIE: Oh, no no no, it's a Razorback -- See, here are the tusks, and... a scary... razor back.
BUFFY: Maybe we could change to the Sunnydale Pure Pork Sausages.
FLUTIE: Well, what do you expect when you only raise $23.48 at the Mascot Car Wash. You're just lucky my Uncle Merle owns a farm.
FLUTIE: Here you go, young man. I'll give you the honor of  returning him to his pen -- our Ragin' Razorback!
BUFFY: Way to go, Bobby -- I couldn't even grab its squiggly pink tail.
BOBBY: (false modesty) Well, Buffy, you did have the moves - but sometimes you just gotta rely on tonnage.
WILLOW: Don't just give up, Xander! So you're having trouble with a few equations --
XANDER: No! Now I don't even get the numbers!
WILLOW: Here -- tonight I'll help you --
XANDER: (erupting) --WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
HERROLD: Bobby, get over here! People, line up and choose sides  for Dodge Ball! Lance -- take off those glasses!
WILLOW: --He's just fallen in with a bad influence --
BUFFY: No, "bad influence" is a Rob Lowe movie. Xander's just  gone bad -- there's no excuse for what he did!
WILLOW: What's wrong with you, Xander?
XANDER: Guess you've noticed -- I've been different around you, lately.
WILLOW: Yes.
XANDER: I think... I think it's because my feelings... for you... have been changing... (off Willow's look) We've been friends for such a long time... and... well... I feel like I need to tell you something...
XANDER: I've... I've decided to drop Algebra... so...
XANDER: I won't need your math help anymore... which means... (for the crowd) I won't have to look at your paste-white face again.
XANDER: Let's do lunch.
KYLE: And one little piggy cried "wee wee wee" all the way -
RHONDA: --Home to dinner.
WILLOW: I've been friends with Xander since we were five. Now  first chance he gets, he insults me to join the  "Soshes." -- And it's my fault. (off Buffy) Because I'm not like you!
BUFFY: Hey c'mon, Willow -- I'm no Sosh.
WILLOW: No, but you're cool enough to be one. He wants you in -- you saw how he treated you last night at the Bronze --
BUFFY: Willow -- that wasn't Xander last night. That was Buddy Love.
WILLOW: No, it's just like those Zoo videos said about the  Animal Kingdom -- high school as a Pecking Order --
WILLOW: And I just have to face it -- I'm a really low peck.
BUFFY: Pity-party over. Look, it's not just you that Xander  and the rest of the Attack Pack are harshing.
BUFFY: Remember that other Zoo video, the way the Hyena  cackled when they attacked that poor Zebra? Well this  morning in the hallway -- the way Kyle laughed, it was  just like that -- Freddie Krugers scary --
BUFFY: You know, those Hyena were quarantined for a reason --  I think Xander's caught something from them.
WILLOW: (sarcastic) Right. The Hyena flu. Everyone's catching it.
BUFFY: Fine. Don't believe me. But I know somebody who will.
GILES: Xander's taken to teasing the less fortunate?
BUFFY: Yes.
GILES: There's been a radical change for the worse in both clothing and hair styling?
BUFFY: Uh-huh.
GILES: And otherwise all his spare time, spent lounging about with imbeciles?
BUFFY: Yes -- don't you see...
GILES: Of course! He's turned into a 16 year old boy! How  terrifying! Get out your stake, Slayer!
BUFFY: I'm telling you, in the Hallway - that laugh -- it wasn't human -  it's something... okay, I'll just say  it -- like a Hyena. I think something supernatural is...
GILES: --Buffy, there's an old saying -- If you're a hammer,  everything looks like a nail.
BUFFY: Yes, I know, my Mom listens to Simon and Garfunkle too.
GILES: Who? (beat) Anyway, the point is, look for the most likely explanation first.
BUFFY: Which is?
GILES: The youthful budding of testosterone.  (off her) Hang on to your hat, little lady, it's only likely to get worse.
WILLOW: Herbert -- they found him!
BUFFY: Herbert -- the pig?
WILLOW: Dead -- In the Biology Room -- totally... eaten! Mr. Flutie's even crying!
GILES: Eaten... by what?
WILLOW: (ominous) By "whom"... (off their looks) I overheard Principal Flutie talking to the Biology Teacher -- some of the teeth marks -- were from braces.
BUFFY: "Just a sixteen year old boy", huh?
GILES: The Hyena section is this way --
BOBBY: Sorry Coach! Let me get it!
HERROLD: I thought I put you on a strict diet!
BOBBY: But... but this is just some energy food for the run today --
HERROLD: We have twenty-three young men on our cross country  team, Bobby. Guess who's slower than all of them.
BOBBY: Ernie Fairfax?
HERROLD: The boy's got a broken hip, Bobby. He wears a bodycast. And he still beats you. (beat) I'm just saying, son -- forget the run today. Join the Chess team.
BOBBY: Please don't cut me... Coach...
KYLE: MMmmmm -- en-er-gy food!
BOBBY: Why do you guys hate me so much?
XANDER: We don't hate you. Not all of us, anyway.
RHONDA: We felt kinda bummed about last night at the Bronze.
XANDER: Yeah, we figured -- Bobby's pretty cool, holding the table for us.
RHONDA: The kinda guy who could hang with us. So we took a vote, 5-1 to let you in.
BOBBY: So -- I'm in?
RHONDA: Nah. Kyle blackballed you.
KYLE: (shrugging) Hey, it's not personal. I just think you gotta drop some poundage.
BOBBY: (disappointed) Oh.
RHONDA: Underneath, I think you're kinda cute.
KYLE: But how's he gonna lose the weight?
XANDER: Cross Country's got a 3 mile run through the woods this afternoon... Hey! You're on Cross Country, arencha' Bobby?
BOBBY: (disappointed) Coach wants to cut me.
XANDER: And you believed him, Bobby?
RHONDA: He's just testing you -  see what you're made of.
KYLE: You know, Rhonda's right -- that's how Coach tests  people. You make that run today, Bob-by.
BOBBY: Why do you guys want to help me?
XANDER: Because Bobby, it's like today, when you sat on the pig -- hey, you make us laugh. (beat) Now get out there and feel the burn.
BUFFY: Check this out -- Hyenas.
BUFFY: Wow. Apparently, Noah rejected Hyenas from the Ark because he thought they were an evil, impure mixture of dogs and cats. (turns a page) Just another reason not to date out of species.
WILLOW: I don't get it -- He obviously let cockroaches on board.
WILLOW: So what happened? The Hyena survived anyway.
BUFFY: Barely. But afterwards, they definitely had some  issues with Noah...
GILES: Perhaps I've discovered the way in which they intended to get even.
WILLOW: How?
GILES: The Masai of the Serengeti Plain believe it is  possible for animals to possess the souls of humans in order to accomplish their various desires.
BUFFY: Do you think Xander could've been possessed by... the Hyenas?
WILLOW: (skeptical) C'mon -- do you really believe this stuff about "animal possessions"?
GILES: (turning the page) Perhaps Willow's right -- otherwise, I should think we would recognize our young friend's behavior in these...
BUFFY: (jumping up) I've gotta find Xander!
XANDER: I've been waiting for you to jump my bones.
BUFFY: Get off me!
XANDER: Is that what you really want? We both know what you really want.
XANDER: You want danger, don't you -  you like your men dangerous --
BUFFY: You're in trouble -- infected with some Hyena thing, like a demonic possession --
XANDER: --Dangerous and mean, right? Like Mr. Black Leather  Motorcycle Guy -- Well, guess who just got mean --
BUFFY: I don't want to hurt you, Xander.
XANDER: I knew you were following me. I'd know your smell a mile a way.
BUFFY: You and the others -- ate Herbert alive --
XANDER: --You now how long I've waited? Until you'd stop  pretending we aren't attracted--
XANDER: Until Willow'd stop kidding herself, that I'd settle for anyone but you --
BUFFY: No, stop it -- You're scaring me.
XANDER: Being scared make you wanna hurt me? C'mon, Slayer -- I like it when you smell scared.
XANDER: --The more I scare you, the better you smell.
BUFFY: What part of "NO" don't you understand!
XANDER: The "N."
XANDER: (soft) Welcome to the jungle.
BOBBY: Hey! Wait up!
BOBBY: Ow! OW! owwwwWWW!
BOBBY: Come back! Somebody help me!
BOBBY: Who's there?
BOBBY: Oh, you guys! Man, I'm glad to see you.
BOBBY: Hurt my ankle -- Can you guys help me out?
BOBBY: What're you doing?
BOBBY: Stop it!
BOBBY: I thought we were going to be friends!
BOBBY: Hey!
BUFFY: Hurry -- we've gotta look him up somehow, before he comes to.
WILLOW: Ohmigod, Xander -- is he alright?
BUFFY: Oh fine. He's just enjoying a little brick-induced  coma designed to prevent felony sexual assault.
GILES: Oh Buffy, the Hyena in him didn't --
BUFFY: No, but it's safe to say that in his current state, his idea of wooing somebody doesn't include a Yanni CD  and a bottle of Chianti. (thumbs behind her) And there's five more of them out there. What've you found?
GILES: The book says nothing about Hyena exorcisms...
WILLOW: How'd they stop it in the past?
GILES: I'm afraid the only solution is... (reading) "Shoot to kill."
BUFFY: Shoot to kill! Now what?
GILES: We buy guns?
BUFFY: Who wrote this book -- the Michigan Militia? They're just teenagers.
GILES: And I thought I'd found such a distinctly American solution to the problem. Well, I honestly don't know where else to look --  (an idea) Malleus Maleficarum!
WILLOW: Swearing is never appropriate in any language.
GILES: No, no, no -- the Malleus Maleficarum, written by Sprenger and Kraemer in 1486, speaks directly to all demonic possessions!
GILES: Its knowledge of the occult is so comprehensive, Pope Innocent authorized that only twenty-eight editions be published --
GILES: YES! The entire procedure described -  we simply need to transfer the evil spirits... (crestfallen) ...Into some other human...
GILES: ...Or an animal...
BUFFY: The Hyenas at the Zoo! The Zookeeper knew they were sick in the first place --
GILES: Willow, continue your video research -- whatever you  do -- don't let Xander out. Buffy, you come with me.  We must find that Zookeeper --
BUFFY: --Before those Hyena Kids get the munchies for more  than bacon.
WILLOW: Guys...
XANDER: She whacked me with a brick -  Buffy hit me with a brick --
WILLOW: You deserved it.
XANDER: (sweetly) What I said to you this morning, Willow -- about  being... pasty-faced -- I'm sooo sorry...
WILLOW: I know, Xander -- but it wasn't really you talking.
XANDER: So help me, Willow.
WILLOW: We are -- Buffy and Giles are the --
XANDER: --No... I mean, you -- you're the only one who can really help me -- let me out.
WILLOW: Giles and Buffy said --
XANDER: --Why're you even listening to Buffy? She doesn't care about you the way I do.
WILLOW: Buffy's our best friend --
XANDER: --Best Friend? Think about it, Willow -  how long have you know me?
WILLOW: Since Mrs. Connor's Kindergarten class.
XANDER: You've only know Buffy since the beginning of the Semester --
WILLOW: So -- she's saved our lives about a dozen times already.
XANDER: She's the reason she had to save our live -- I'm  telling you, this weird stuff didn't start happening  until Buffy checked in to our lives --
XANDER: Vampires... Zombies... now (air quotations) "Evil Hyena Spirits." I mean she only tells us whatever she needs to use us. (beat) I've told you my deepest secrets -  what's Buffy ever told you?
WILLOW: Xander, I think "Slayer" ranks up there with childhood bed-wetter.
XANDER: --Okay, she's a Slayer of the Undead -- so why's she  hanging out with you? Can't you see, she thinks she's  way socially superior.
XANDER: I'm only telling you this because I love you, Willow - - and I don't want to see you get hurt.
WILLOW: You have a pretty warped way of showing it.
XANDER: We belong together, Willow -  Buffy's the outside who came between us. (softly) Let me out -- pleeease.
XANDER: Just hand me those keys right there...
WILLOW: I don't think so.
ZOOKEEPER: Thank goodness you came to me. (beat) You see, I was afraid this might happen when I brought the Hyenas from Africa...
GILES: --Excuse me. You knew your Hyena were possessed with an evil spirit, yet you --
ZOOKEEPER: --I explicitly warned those students --
BUFFY: --Reality Burrito, Senor. To High School students, an explicit warning is an invitation.
ZOOKEEPER: Young Lady -- I have advanced degrees in Zoology, anthropology, primitive cultures - if I had ever thought that --
GILES: Yes, well now the unthinkable has occurred --
ZOOKEEPER: (shaking his head) That young man's death is only the beginning.
ZOOKEEPER: By my calculations, in the next several hours, the  possessed students will be totally transformed by the  Hyena Spirits. Once that occurs, the students can  never return to normal.
BUFFY: (horrified) No more Xander...
ZOOKEEPER: (ominous) Then, they'll be as dangerous to the public as if our own Hyenas had escaped the Zoo.
BUFFY: Not if you help us.
ZOOKEEPER: I can't. I don't know how.
GILES: What if we know something you don't know.
ZOOKEEPER: (pompous) I am the foremost authority on animal trans- possessions. If I haven't written the book, I've read it.
GILES: You've obviously not read all the books on the  subject, sir -- the Malleus Maleficarum was quite  clear regarding trans-possession.
ZOOKEEPER: You have a copy? That book's been out of print since 1486... Who are you, anyway?
GILES: (proud) I, sir, am a High School Librarian. (reading) Trans-possession simply requires that one stare deeply  into the Hyena's eyes while involved in a cruel act --
ZOOKEEPER: (lost in thought) A cruel act... I see... of course... it's... so simple...No wonder good people can't find a cure -- by their very nature they're incapable of committing the necessary cruel act.
BUFFY: --We just need your Hyenas as a receptacle for the flying spirits.
ZOOKEEPER: Maybe I can help you after all--
ZOOKEEPER: The possessed students -- how soon can you get them to the Hyena Cage?
BUFFY: We caught one -- but there's five more.
GILES: Not to worry, Sir. That boy is secure in a cage in the school a library.
ZOOKEEPER: Oh no no no -- after the Hyena People eat, they sleep  -- but the moment they wake, they'll search for the  missing member of their Pack! (ominous) They won't rest until they find him.
BUFFY: Willow!
XANDER: Willow. Lots of times when we're together -- Biology,  the Bronze -- I catch you leaning forward to let your  hair hang down --
XANDER: --Then you peek through the strands, just enough to check me out. I know what you're feeling deep inside you --
WILLOW: La la la la la, I'm not listening to you.
WILLOW: Xander, shut up.
BUFFY: Read more.
GILES: With dispatch! Quickly!
GILES: Periodical?
WILLOW: They're gone --
GILES: (re: watch) If we don't change them back in the next hour, it's too late -- they'll be Hyenas forever. And our friend --
WILLOW: --Xander will be lost.
BUFFY: I'll catch them.
GILES: Buffy -- this isn't simply about plunging stakes into the Undead -- You're over your head on this one. Let me come with you.
BUFFY: (shaking her head) You can't keep up.
ANDERSON: Joey, that's ignorant and you know it.
ANDERSON: Joey, how many times I tell you -  chew with your mouth closed!
JOEY: My mouth wath clothed!
JOEY: Tiffany, thut up!
KYLE: Tif-fanyyy... Tif-fanyyy...
BUFFY: Hey, Xander! Didn't your Mom teach you? Don't play with your food
WILLOW: The pathway to the Hyena Pit.
GILES: I'll go in and prepare the Zookeeper. Willow, stay here -- you'll forwarn us when Buffy and the others approach.
GILES: (whispering) Dr... Zookeeper -- are you here?
GILES: Good gracious -- I nearly mistook you for a Hyena --  are you prepared for the trans-possession?
WILLOW: They're almost here! (then) Giles... Giles?...
ZOOKEEPER: Don't scream. (re: body paint) It's all part of the Masai tradition.
WILLOW: Where are the Hyenas for the trans-possession?
ZOOKEEPER: Over there, in the feeding area.
ZOOKEEPER: Stay clear. They haven't been fed.
WILLOW: (looking around) Where's Giles?
ZOOKEEPER: Don't worry. He's involved with his part of the plan.
WILLOW: They're almost here... shouldn't you bring the Hyenas out?
ZOOKEEPER: When the time is right.
WILLOW: That's Buffy! Get ready!
WILLOW: What're you doing?
ZOOKEEPER: The cruel act, remember?
WILLOW: (uncertain) Oh, right -- you'll pretend to slash my throat and put The Evil in the Hyenas behind the wall --
ZOOKEEPER: Something like that.
WILLOW: BUFFY! IT'S A TRAP!
ZOOKEEPER: (incanting) NYMBA YA SANAA!
BUFFY: Guess it's just us.
XANDER: That's all we'll need.
GILES: Did I miss anything?
WILLOW: ...First we though you'd gone "Sosh" on us --
XANDER: C'mon, I could never be that snotty...
BUFFY: At the end, you were minutes away from going full-time Hyena.
XANDER: Hey believe me, I don't remember anything. Nothing --  From when I tried to save Lance in the Hyena Pit, to  when I woke up there and tried to save Willow --
WILLOW: So you do remember saving my life?
XANDER: No one messes with my Willow.
BUFFY: You better not remember, because you talked some trash to me that --
XANDER: Hey, I wish I could say that I went to this beautiful  place -- and you were there, and you were there, and  you were there -- But I can't. (shrugging) All those slides are missing.
BUFFY: Alright...well... We're just glad you're back -- on two feet again.
GILES: I think they bought that -- Hyena Boy.
XANDER: Shoot me, stuff me, mount me--
XANDER: I am so HUMILIATED!
