XANDER: May I cut in?
XANDER: Are you all right?
BUFFY: Thanks to you.
BUFFY: You hurt your hand . . . will you still be able to . . . ?
XANDER: Finish my solo and then kiss you like you've never been kissed before?
BUFFY: You're drooling . . .
BUFFY: <u>Xander</u> . . . you've got a little . . .
GREGORY: Their ancestors were here long before we were - their progeny will  be here long after we're gone. The simple and ubiquitous ant. If you did the homework, you'll know the two ways that ants communicate . . . Ms. Summers?
BUFFY: Ways that ants communicate.
GREGORY: Yes . . .
BUFFY: With other ants.
GREGORY: No, with lemons. From the homework, the ants are communicating in two ways . . .
BUFFY: . . . touch . . . and . . . B.O.?
BLAYNE: (re: Xander) Thank God someone finally found the courage to mention that.
GREGORY: Touch and <u>smell</u>, Ms. Summers. (without turning to look at Willow) Is there anything else Ms. Rosenberg would like to tell you?
GREGORY: Chapters six through eight by Wednesday, people. (to Buffy) Could I see you for a moment?
BLAYNE: Cheryl, wait up, doll. (aside to Xander) Isn't she something? Do you know what a woman like that wants? (Xander waits to hear:) No, I guess you wouldn't.
XANDER: (calls out to Blayne) Something really cutting! (to Willow) Sometimes I just go with the generic insult.
WILLOW: Why pay more for the brand name?
GREGORY: I gather you had a few problems at your last school.
BUFFY: Well, what teenager doesn't --
GREGORY: (emerging from closet) Cut school, get in fights, burn down the gymnasium? (off her look) Principal Flutie showed me your permanent record.
BUFFY: That fire, there were major extenuating circumstances -- actually it's sort of funny --
GREGORY: I can't wait to see what you're going to do here.
BUFFY: (deflating) Destructo-Girl, that's me.
GREGORY: But I suspect it's going to be great.
BUFFY: You mean great in a bad way?
GREGORY: You've got a first rate mind. You can think on your feet -- imagine what you could accomplish if you did . . . ?
BUFFY: The homework thing?
GREGORY: The homework thing. I understand you probably have a good excuse for not doing it. Amazingly enough, I don't care. I know you can excel in this class and so I expect no less. Is that clear?
BUFFY: Okay. Sorry.
GREGORY: Don't be sorry, be smart.
GREGORY: And please don't listen to the Principal or anyone else's negative opinions about you. Let's make 'em eat that permanent record, what do you say?
BUFFY: Uh . . . thanks?
GREGORY: Chapters six through eight.
BUFFY: Dr. Gregory didn't chew me out or  anything. He was really cool. But Flutie showed him my permanent record. Apparently I fall somewhere between Charles Manson and a really <u>bad</u> person.
WILLOW: And you can't tell Dr. Gregory what really happened at your old school?
BUFFY: I was fighting vampires? I'm thinking he might not believe me.
WILLOW: Yeah, he probably gets that excuse all the time.
CORDELIA: Here lies a problem. What used to be my table occupied by pitiful  losers. Of course we'll have to burn it.
BUFFY: Sad, you have so many memories here. You and Lawrence, you and Mark, you and John. You spent the better part of your "J" through "M" here.
BLAYNE: Seven. Including Cheryl. I tell you though, her sister was looking  to make it eight.
BLAYNE: Home for the holidays and looking for love. Not my type, though. Girl's really gotta have something to go with me.
XANDER: Something like a lobotomy?
BLAYNE: Xander. How many times've you scored?
XANDER: Well . . .
BLAYNE: Just a question.
XANDER: Are we talking today or the whole week? Uh oh, duty calls.
XANDER: Babes . . .
BUFFY: What are you doing?
XANDER: Work with me here. Blayne had the  nerve to question my manliness. I'm just giving him a visual.
WILLOW: (clutching Xander tighter) We'll show him.
BUFFY: (looking off) I don't believe it.
XANDER: I know. And after all my conquests--
XANDER: Who's that?
WILLOW: That must be Angel. I think.
XANDER: That weird guy? That warned her about the vampires?
WILLOW: That's him, I'll bet you.
XANDER: (a little plaintively) Well, he's buff. She never said anything about him being buff.
WILLOW: You think he's buff?
XANDER: (angry) He's a very attractive man! How come that never came up?
BUFFY: Well, look who's here.
ANGEL: Hi.
BUFFY: I'd say it's nice to see you but we both know that's a big fib.
ANGEL: I won't stay long.
BUFFY: No, you'll just give me a cryptic warning about some exciting new catastrophe and then disappear into the night. Right?
ANGEL: You're cold.
BUFFY: You can take it.
ANGEL: I mean you look cold.
XANDER: Oh right, give her your jacket. It's a balmy night, nobody needs to be trading clothing out there.
WILLOW: I don't think she even likes him . . .
BUFFY: (re: jacket) Little big on me.
BUFFY: What happened?
ANGEL: I didn't pay attention.
BUFFY: To somebody with a big fork?
ANGEL: He's coming.
BUFFY: The fork guy?
ANGEL: Don't let him corner you. And don't give him a moment's mercy. He'll rip your throat out.
BUFFY: Okay, I give you improved marks. Ripping the throat out: non-cryptic, it's a strong visual . . .
ANGEL: I have to go.
BUFFY: Sweet dreams to you, too.
BUFFY: That's all. "Cryptic" guy said "Fork" guy.
GILES: I think there's too many guys in your life. (she gives him a look) I'll see what I can find out. (gazes at sky with loathing) God, every day here is the same.
BUFFY: Bright, sunny, beautiful. How can we escape this torment?
GILES: (gazes at sky) Reminds me of home.
BUFFY: Dark, dank, dreary. You must be so  happy.
XANDER: Guess what I just over-heard in the office. No Dr. Gregory today. Ergo those of us who blew off our Science homework . . . (shuts Willow's book) . . . are not as dumb as we look.
BUFFY: What happened, is he sick?
XANDER: They didn't say anything about sick -- something about . . . missing.
BUFFY: He's missing?
XANDER: Hold on, let me think, the cheerleaders were modeling the new short skirts and I kinda got . . . yeah, I think they said missing.
XANDER: Which is bad.
BUFFY: If something's wrong, yeah.
WILLOW: He's one of the only teachers who doesn't think Buffy is a felon.
XANDER: (to Buffy) I'm really sorry. I'm sure he'll -- iya-hoo.
NATALIE: Could you help me?
XANDER: Egguh -- yes.
NATALIE: I'm looking for Science one oh nine.
XANDER: Sure. It's, uh . . . I go there everyday -- (to Buffy and Willow) -- oh god, where is it?
BLAYNE: Hi. Blayne Mall. I'm going there right now. It's not far from the  Varsity Field where I took all city last year . . .
NATALIE: Thank you, Blayne.
XANDER: Funny how the earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to.
WILLOW: What's wrong.
BUFFY: If he dropped his glasses why  didn't he pick them up?
NATALIE: My name is Natalie French, I'll be substituting for Dr. Gregory.
BUFFY: Do you know when he's coming back?
NATALIE: No I don't . . . (looks at seating chart) Buffy. They just call and tell me where they want me.
BLAYNE: (sotto) I'll tell you where I want you . . .
NATALIE: Excuse me, Blayne?
BLAYNE: I was just wondering if you were going to pick up where Dr. Gregory left off.
NATALIE: Yes, his notes tell me you were right in the middle of insect life.
NATALIE: The praying mantis is a fascinating creature, forced to live alone. Who can tell me why -- Buffy?
BUFFY: Well, the words "bug ugly" kinda spring to mind.
NATALIE: There's nothing ugly about these unique creatures. The reason they live alone is because they're cannibals.
NATALIE: (to class) It's hardly their fault -- it's the way Nature designed them: noble, solitary . . .
NATALIE: And prolific: over eighteen hundred species worldwide. In nearly all of them the female is larger and more aggressive than the male.
BLAYNE: Nothing wrong with an aggressive female.
NATALIE: The California Mantis lays her eggs and <u>then</u> finds a mate . . .
NATALIE: . . . to fertilize them. Once he's played his part, she covers the eggs in a protective sack and attaches them to a leaf or a twig, out of danger.
NATALIE: If she's done her job correctly, in a few months she'll have several hundred offspring.
NATALIE: We should make some model egg sacks for the Science Fair. Who'd like to help me do that after school? I warn you, it's a delicate art, I'd have to work with you very closely, one on one . . .
BUFFY: Hot dog surprise . . . be still my heart.
WILLOW: Call me old fashioned, I don't want any more surprises in my hot dogs . . .
XANDER: I wonder what she sees in me . . .
XANDER: Probably just the quiet good looks coupled with a certain smoky magnetism.
XANDER: Miss French. You two might be a little young to understand what an older woman sees in a younger man.
BUFFY: Oh I understand.
XANDER: Good.
BUFFY: A younger man is too dumb to wonder why an older woman can't find someone her own age and too desperate to care about the surgical improvements.
XANDER: I'm not too dumb to . . . what surgical improvements?
WILLOW: Well, he <u>is</u> young.
BUFFY: And so terribly innocent.
XANDER: Those who can, do. Those who can't laugh at those who . . . can do.
BLAYNE: Gotta carb up for my one on one with Miss French today. When's yours? Oh right, tomorrow. You came in second and I came in first. I guess that's what they call natural selection.
XANDER: I guess that's what they call rehearsal.
CORDELIA: Excuse you . . .
CORDELIA: . . . medically prescribed lunch, my doctor ships it daily, I'll only be here as long as I can hold my breath . . .
GILES: Here. Drink this.
BUFFY: (taking it) No thank you.
XANDER: I've never seen . . . I mean, I've  never seen anything like . . . that was new.
WILLOW: Who would want to hurt Dr. Gregory?
GILES: He had no enemies on the staff that I know of. He was a civilized man.  I liked him.
BUFFY: (small voice) So did I.
WILLOW: Well, we're gonna find out who did this. We'll find them and we'll stop them.
BUFFY: Count on it.
GILES: What do we know?
BUFFY: Not a lot. He was killed on campus, I'm guessing. The same day we last saw him.
GILES: How do you know?
BUFFY: Didn't change his clothes.
XANDER: This is a question nobody particularly wants to hear, but, where did they put his head?
WILLOW: Good point. I <u>didn't</u> want to hear that.
BUFFY: Angel. He warned me something was coming.
GILES: (remembering) Yes. Yes he did and I wish I knew what he meant. (grabbing a text) All I could locate was an oblique reference to a vampire who displeased the Master and cut off his hand for penance.
BUFFY: Cut off his hand and replaced it with a fork?
WILLOW: Wow, I've heard of eating disorders, but . . .
GILES: I don't know what he replaced it with.
XANDER: Why would that guy come after a teacher?
GILES: I'm not certain he did. There was an incident two nights ago with a  homeless man in Weatherly Park. He was practically shredded. But nothing like Dr. Gregory.
BUFFY: Fork guy doesn't do heads.
GILES: No.
BUFFY: And Dr. Gregory's blood wasn't drained.
XANDER: So there's something <u>else</u> out there? Besides silverware man? This is fun. We're on Monster Island.
GILES: We don't know it's something else. This fellow is still our likeliest suspect.
BUFFY: Where was that guy killed? Weatherly Park?
GILES: Buffy, I know you're upset. But this is not the time to go hunting. Not until we know more. Promise me you won't do anything rash.
BUFFY: Cross my heart.
GUY: (drunk) Shouldn't be here at night l'il lady, s'dangerous.
GUY: I heard him -- spread out!
BUFFY: Yep.
GILES: . . . when you promised me you wouldn't.
BUFFY: Yeah, I lied, I'm a bad person. Let's move on.
GILES: Did you see someone with a fork?
BUFFY: (nods) More like a jumbo claw.
GILES: Oh, well, at least you weren't hurt.
BUFFY: And I saw something else, something much more interesting than your run-of-the-mill killer vampire.
GILES: What was that?
BUFFY: Do you know Miss French, the teacher who's substituting for Dr. Gregory?
GILES: Oh, she's lovely . . . (off Buffy's look) . . . in a common, extremely  well-proportioned sort of way.
BUFFY: I'm chasing clawguy last night, we're on the street . . .
GILES: Yes?
BUFFY: And Miss Well-Proportioned is heading home, I figure she's his next meal. He takes one look at her and runs screaming for cover.
GILES: He what? Ran away?
BUFFY: He was petrified.
GILES: Of Miss French.
BUFFY: Yes! So I'm an undead monster who can shave with his hand -- how many things am I afraid of?
GILES: Not many. And not substitute teachers, as a rule.
BUFFY: So what is her deal?
GILES: I think it would be a good idea to keep an eye on her.
BUFFY: Then I'd better get to class.
FLUTIE: You were there, you saw Dr. Gregory, didn't you?
BUFFY: You mean yesterday in the cafeteria, after he was --
FLUTIE: (looking around) Don't say "dead", or decapitated,  or decomposing. I would stay away from "d" words all together. But you witnessed the event so this way please.
BUFFY: I've gotta . . . I'll be late for biology.
FLUTIE: Extremely late. You have to see a counselor. Everyone who saw the body has to see a crisis counselor.
BUFFY: I really don't need --
FLUTIE: We all need help with our feelings, otherwise we bottle them up and before you know it powerful laxatives are involved.
FLUTIE: I really believe if we all reach out to one another we can beat this thing. I'm always here if you need a hug -- but not a real hug, there's no touching in this school, we're sensitive to wrong touching.
BUFFY: But I really feel okay.
FLUTIE: No you talk to the counselor and start the healing. You have to heal.
BUFFY: (starts to leave) Mr. Flutie, I --
FLUTIE: (as to a dog) Heal.
CORDELIA: . . . it was . . . let's just say I haven't been able to eat a thing since yesterday . . . I think I lost like seven and a half ounces -- way swifter than the so-called diet that quack put me on -- (off counselor's <u>unseen</u> look) -- oh, I'm not saying we should kill a teacher everyday just so I can lose weight, I'm just saying when tragedy strikes we have to look on the bright side -- you know, like how even a used Mercedes still has leather seats.
NATALIE: Keep your eyes straight ahead, on your own test . . .
NATALIE: I think you meant "pollination" for number fourteen.
NATALIE: I'll see you here after school.
BUFFY: Great, a pop quiz.
BUFFY: (to Willow) No, no I'm not saying she craned her neck, it was the full-on exorcist twist.
WILLOW: Ouch.
BUFFY: Which reminds me, how come Blayne who worked with her "one on one" yesterday, isn't here today?
WILLOW: Inquiring minds want to know.
BUFFY: Any luck?
GILES: I haven't found any creature just yet that strikes terror in a vampire's heart -- I'm not sure I want to.
BUFFY: Try looking under "Things That Can Turn Their Heads All The Way Around".
GILES: Nothing human can do that.
BUFFY: No. Nothing human. But there's some insects that can. (beat, determined) Whatever she is, I'm gonna be ready for her.
GILES: What are you going to do?
BUFFY: (turns back) My homework.
BUFFY: Where's the books on bugs?
NATALIE: Oh, hi. I was just grabbing a  snack. Can I make you something?
XANDER: No thanks, I never eat when I'm making egg sacks. (re: egg sack model) Wow, if these were real, the bugs'd be . . .
NATALIE: Big as you.
XANDER: Yeah. So where do we start?
NATALIE: Oh Xander, I've done something really stupid, I hope you can forgive me.
XANDER: Forgiveness is my middle name -- actually it's LaVelle -- I'd appreciate it if you'd guard that secret with your life.
NATALIE: (smiles then:) I have a teacher conference in half an hour and I left the paint and paper mache' at home. I don't suppose you'd want to come to my place tonight and work on it there.
XANDER: Come to . . . your place?
NATALIE: It'd just be the two of us. I'd feel more comfortable there, you know, about letting my hair down.
XANDER: Right, that's important, 'cause when your hair's not down it's . . . up.
NATALIE: It's a date then. Seven-thirty. (hands him paper) Here's my address. (I want you) I'll see you tonight.
XANDER: Yessss!!
BUFFY: Dig this -- "the praying mantis can rotate it's head a hundred and eighty degrees while waiting for a  meal to wander by . . ." Hah! (off their looks) Well, come on guys. Hah!
WILLOW: Well, Miss French is sort of big. For a bug.
GILES: She is also, by and large, woman-shaped.
BUFFY: Factoid one: only the praying mantis can turn it's head like that. Factoid two: a pretty wacked-out vampire is scared to death of her. Factoid three: her fashion sense screams predator.
WILLOW: It's the shoulder pads.
BUFFY: Exactly.
GILES: If you're right, she'd have to be a shapeshifter, or perception distorter . . . (making a connection) Half a moment . . . I had a chum at Oxford, Carlyle, advanced degrees in entomology and mythology . . .
BUFFY: Whosy and whatsy?
GILES: Bugs and fairy tales.
BUFFY: I knew that.
GILES: If I recall correctly, poor Carlyle, just before he went mad, claimed there was a beast --
WILLOW: (re: computer) Buffy, nine one one. Blayne's mom called the school, he never came  home last night.
GILES: The boy who worked with Miss French yesterday?
WILLOW: Yeah. If Miss French is responsible for . . . Xander's supposed to be helping her right now . . . he's got a crush on a giant insect!
BUFFY: Let's not panic, I'll warn him. I need you to stretch your hacker muscles and see if you can get something from the Coroner's office.
WILLOW: What are we looking for?
BUFFY: Autopsy on Dr. Gregory. I've been trying to figure out the marks I saw on his corpse -- I'm thinking they might have been teeth -- and these cuddlies . . .
BUFFY: . . . should definitely be brushing after every meal. (to Giles) You were saying something about a beast?
GILES: (nods) I just have to make one trans-Atlantic phone call. (heads for phone; stops) This computer invasion Willow's performing on the Coroner's office -- one assumes it's entirely legal?
WILLOW: Of course -- -- entirely.
GILES: So I wasn't here, didn't see it, couldn't have stopped you.
BUFFY: Good idea.
BUFFY: Hey.
XANDER: Hey.
BUFFY: So how'd it go with Miss French after school?
XANDER: Well, it's a little demanding being her . . . absolute favorite guy in the universe, but I'll just have to  muddle through.
BUFFY: Xander, she's not what she seems.
XANDER: I know, she's so much more.
BUFFY: Look, I have to tell you some stuff about her and I really need you to listen, okay?
XANDER: Okay.
BUFFY: I don't think she's human. She can do the twisty with her head -- ever see the Exorcist? Plus Blayne, who was last seen in her class  yesterday afternoon, is now missing.
XANDER: I see. So she's not human she's . . .?
BUFFY: Technically I guess you'd have to call her a big old bug. (Xander smiles) I know it sounds a little weird but --
XANDER: (laughs) It's not weird, it's perfectly understandable. I've met someone, you're jealous.
BUFFY: I'm not --
XANDER: Nothing I could do about it. There's just a certain chemical thing between Miss French and me.
BUFFY: I know, I just read about it, it's called, uh, a pheromone, this chemical attractant insects give off.
XANDER: <u>SHE'S NOT AN INSECT</u>!! -- okay? She's a woman. Hard as it may be for you to conceive, a <u>human woman</u> finds me attractive. I realize she's no mystery guy handing out leather jackets -- and while we're on the subject, what kinda girly-name is Angel anyway?
BUFFY: What's that got to do with --
XANDER: Nothing! It just bugs me. (beat) I really gotta . . . (he takes off)
BUFFY: Xander . . .
NATALIE: Hi, come on in.
NATALIE: Oh, should I change, is it too . . .?
XANDER: No, no. It's the most beautiful chest -- dress! -- I've ever seen.
NATALIE: Thank you, that's sweet. Martini?
NATALIE: I'm sorry, would you like something else? I just need to relax a little, I'm kind of nervous around you. You're probably cool as a cucumber.
XANDER: (mile a minute) I like cucumbers -- you know in that Greek salad thing with the yogurt -- you like Greek food? I'm exempting schwarma here, what is that all about, big meat hive . . . (grabs glass, drains it) <u>Hehh</u>-looo.
NATALIE: (clinks his empty glass) Cheers. (moves close) Can I ask you a personal question? Have you ever been with a woman before?
XANDER: You mean like, in the same room --
NATALIE: (closer still) You know what I mean.
XANDER: Oh, that. Well, let me think, there was . . . several, you know, I mean quite a few times that . . . and then there was . . . she was so incredibly . . . no.
NATALIE: (touching his hair, face) I know, I can tell.
XANDER: You can?
NATALIE: I like it. You might say I need it.
XANDER: Well, needs are, you know, needs should definitely be met as long as they don't require ointments the next day or --
XANDER: Do you hear --
NATALIE: No.
XANDER: Sounds like somebody crying for --
NATALIE: I don't hear anything. Your hands are so . . . (takes his hands) . . . hot.
BUFFY: You hurt your hand . . .
XANDER: Buffy. I love Buffy . . . wow, so that's a martini, huh?
XANDER: Are you sure somebody's not --
NATALIE: Would you like to touch me with those hands?
XANDER: Your hands are really . . .
XANDER: . . . serrated? That drink must have, I think I need to . . .
XANDER: Miss . . . French?
MANTIS: Please, call me Natalie.
GILES: Young lady, I don't care what time it is, unlock his cell, unstrap him and bring him to the phone this instant. Lives are at stake!
WILLOW: (at computer) Got it. (Buffy joins her) Coroner's autopsy, complete with . . . (turning away) . . . yuck, color pictures.
BUFFY: They <u>are</u> teeth marks . . . (re: mantis in text book) . . . which match perfectly the one insect that nips off its prey's head.
WILLOW: Okay, this I do not like . . .
BUFFY: It's the way they feed: head first. And the way they mate -- (re: book) The female eats the male's head while they're . . .
WILLOW: (losing it) No, no see, Xander is, I really like his head, that's where you find his eyes and hair, his adorable smile . . .
BUFFY: Take it easy, Will, Xander's not in any immediate danger. I saw him leave school -- I'm sure he's safe and sound at home right now.
XANDER: Yaahhhh!
XANDER: Blayne --
BLAYNE: Oh god, oh god, oh god . . .
XANDER: Are you --
BLAYNE: You gotta get me outta here, you gotta . . . she, she gets you and . . .
XANDER: What? <u>What does she do</u>?
BLAYNE: No, no, no, no . . .
XANDER: Blayne! What does she do?
BLAYNE: She . . .she takes you out of the cage and ties you up then she, like, starts throbbing and moving and all these eggs come shooting out of her -- and then . . .
XANDER: What? Then what?
BLAYNE: She mates with you!
XANDER: She . . .?
BLAYNE: That's not the worst part.
XANDER: (deadpan) It's not?
BLAYNE: Have you seen her teeth? Right while she's -- right in the middle of -- I SAW HER DO IT!
BLAYNE: I don't want to die like that!
XANDER: Blayne . . . Blayne! Chill. Listen to me, we're gonna get out of this.
BLAYNE: You got a plan? What is it?
XANDER: (doesn't have a clue) Let me just perfect it . . .
BLAYNE: (cracking again) Oh god, oh god, oh god . . .
GILES: I understand, Carlyle, I'll take every precaution . . . It sounds just like the creature you described. You were right all along, about everything. (beat) No you weren't right about your mother coming back as a Dachshund, but . . . Try to rest. Ta.
GILES: Dr. Carlyle Ferris spent years transcribing a lost, pre-Germanic language -- what he discovered he kept to himself, until several teenage boys were murdered in the Cotswalds. Then he went hunting for it.
BUFFY: "It" being . . .?
GILES: He calls her a She-Mantis. This type of creature, the Kleptes-Virgo or virgin-thief appears in many cultures: the Greek Sirens, the Celtic Sea-maidens who tore the living flesh from the bones of --
BUFFY: Giles, while we're young.
GILES: The She-Mantis assumes the form of a beautiful woman and lures innocent virgins back to her nest.
BUFFY: (to Willow, comforting) Well, Xander's not a . . . I mean he's probably --
WILLOW: -- going to die!
BUFFY: This thing is breeding. We gotta find it and snuff it. Any tips on the snuffing part?
GILES: Carlyle recommends cleaving all body parts with a sharp blade.
BUFFY: Slice and dice.
GILES: Whatever you do it's got to be sudden and swift -- this beast is dangerous.
BUFFY: Well, your buddy Carlyle faced it, he's still around.
GILES: Yes . . . in a straight jacket howling his innards out day and night.
BUFFY: Okay Admiral, way to inspire the troops.
WILLOW: Xander's not home -- he told his mom he had to go to his teacher's house and work on a science project. He didn't tell her where.
BUFFY: See if you can get her address off the substitute rolls.
BUFFY: (to Giles) You gotta record some bat sonar, fast.
GILES: Bat sonar. Right. What?
BUFFY: Bats eat them -- a praying mantis hears sonar, its whole nervous system goes kaplooie.
GILES: Where am I going to find --
BUFFY: -- in the vid library. I know it's not books but it's still dark and musty, you'll be right at home.
BUFFY: I'll handle the armory.
BLAYNE: What are you -- don't do anything that'll make her mad.
BLAYNE: Hey, all right. Now I can get out of my cage . . . (realizing) . . . into yours. What'd you do that for?
XANDER: (hefting bar) A weapon.
BLAYNE: I think you're going to need it.
WILLOW: Getting her address . . .
BUFFY: Giles!
GILES: Recording bat sonar is so soothingly like having one's teeth drilled.
BUFFY: Let's roll.
WILLOW: According to Miss French's personnel records, she was born in nineteen oh seven -- she's like ninety years old.
GILES: She is terribly well-preserved.
BLAYNE: He did that, he broke the cage, take him not me, take him!!
GILES: What now? I mean we can't just kick down the front door.
BUFFY: Yes, that would be wrong.
FRENCH: Hello dear, I thought I heard . . . are you selling something? Because I'd love to help out but you know I'm on a fixed income.
BUFFY: I'm looking for Miss French.
FRENCH: I'm Miss French.
BUFFY: Natalie French, the substitute biology teacher.
FRENCH: Goodness, that's me. I taught for over thirty years, then I retired in nineteen seventy-two . . .
BUFFY: She used Miss French's records to get in the school -- <u>bite me</u>, she could be anywhere.
FRENCH: No, I'm right here, dear.
XANDER: (deadpan) What's she doing?
BLAYNE: I . . . think it's . . . eenie, meenie, mynie . . .
XANDER: . . . moe.
XANDER: (to keep her from touching him) I'm coming, I'm coming.
WILLOW: What do you do now?
GILES: Abject prayer and supplication spring to mind.
BUFFY: I saw her walking past this park. Carrying grocery bags. She lives in this neighborhood.
WILLOW: I'm gonna start banging on doors.
BUFFY: (stops her) We don't have time for that.
WILLOW: We have to do something!
BUFFY: We will.
BUFFY: I won't be long.
GILES: Buffy!
BLAYNE: Oh yeah, here it comes . . .
XANDER: What, what's happening?!
BLAYNE: How do you like your eggs, bro, over easy or sunny side up?
XANDER: Eggs? She's going to lay some . . .?
WILLOW: Come on Buffy . . .
CLAW: <u>You</u>.
BUFFY: Me.
NATALIE: The California Mantis lays her eggs and <u>then</u> finds a mate . . .
BUFFY: Which house, where is she?
BUFFY: You're not afraid of much, but you're afraid of her --
BUFFY: -- and her cold blood . . .
BUFFY: Better than radar . . .
WILLOW: Buffy!
GILES: Run!
BUFFY: You guys coming?
MANTIS: Kiss me.
XANDER: Can I just say one thing? (she seems to hesitate) <u>HEELLLLPPPP</u>!!
BUFFY: Let him go.
BLAYNE: Help me! Help me!!
BUFFY: (to the others) Get him out. The bug is mine.
BUFFY: Remember Dr. Gregory -- you scarfed his head? He taught me if you do your homework you learn stuff. Like what happens to your nervous system when you hear this:
VOICE: (on recorder) ". . . extremely important to file not simply alphabetically by author . . ."
BUFFY: Giles!
GILES: That's the wrong side!
BUFFY: Xander, get out!
BUFFY: Bat sonar makes your whole nervous system go to hell. You can go there with it.
GILES: I'd say it's deceased.
WILLOW: And dissected.
XANDER: (to Buffy) You okay?
BUFFY: Yeah.
XANDER: Just for the record, you were right, I was an idiot and God bless you.
XANDER: (to Giles and Willow) And thank you guys, too.
BLAYNE: Yeah. Really.
GILES: Pleasure.
WILLOW: (to Xander) I'm really glad you're okay. It's so unfair how she only went after virgins . . .
XANDER: What . . .?
WILLOW: I mean here you guys are, doing the right thing -- <u>the smart thing</u> --  when a lot of other boys your age --
BLAYNE: Big flag on that play, babe. I am no --
GILES: Cat's out of the bag, lads. It's part of the She-Mantis M.O.
XANDER: Isn't this the perfect ending to a wonderful day.
BLAYNE: My dad's a lawyer -- anybody repeats this to anybody, they're gonna find themselves facing a lawsuit.
XANDER: Blayne -- shut up.
WILLOW: I don't think it's bad at all. I think it's really --
WILLOW: (big step back) -- sweet. But certainly nothing I'll ever bring up again --
ANGEL: I heard a rumor there was one less vampire walking around making a nuisance of himself.
BUFFY: There is. Thanks for the tip.
ANGEL: Pleasure's mine.
BUFFY: Of course, it would make things easier if I knew how to get in touch with you.
ANGEL: I'll be around.
BUFFY: Or who you where . . .
BUFFY: Well, anyway, you can have your jacket back.
ANGEL: Looks better on you.
BUFFY: Oh, boy . . .
TEACHER: All mid-term papers will be exactly six pages long -- no more, no less. One third of your grade will be dependent on those papers -- no more, no less . . .
