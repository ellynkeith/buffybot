Hi.
I won't stay long.
You're cold.
I mean you look cold.
I didn't pay attention.
He's coming.
Don't let him corner you. And don't give him a moment's mercy. He'll rip your throat out.
I have to go.
I heard a rumor there was one less vampire walking around making a nuisance of himself.
Pleasure's mine.
I'll be around.
Looks better on you.
