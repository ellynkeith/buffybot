You were there, you saw Dr. Gregory, didn't you?
(looking around) Don't say "dead", or decapitated,  or decomposing. I would stay away from "d" words all together. But you witnessed the event so this way please.
Extremely late. You have to see a counselor. Everyone who saw the body has to see a crisis counselor.
We all need help with our feelings, otherwise we bottle them up and before you know it powerful laxatives are involved.
I really believe if we all reach out to one another we can beat this thing. I'm always here if you need a hug -- but not a real hug, there's no touching in this school, we're sensitive to wrong touching.
No you talk to the counselor and start the healing. You have to heal.
(as to a dog) Heal.
