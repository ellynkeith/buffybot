May I cut in?
Are you all right?
Finish my solo and then kiss you like you've never been kissed before?
(calls out to Blayne) Something really cutting! (to Willow) Sometimes I just go with the generic insult.
Something like a lobotomy?
Well . . .
Are we talking today or the whole week? Uh oh, duty calls.
Babes . . .
Work with me here. Blayne had the  nerve to question my manliness. I'm just giving him a visual.
I know. And after all my conquests--
Who's that?
That weird guy? That warned her about the vampires?
(a little plaintively) Well, he's buff. She never said anything about him being buff.
(angry) He's a very attractive man! How come that never came up?
Oh right, give her your jacket. It's a balmy night, nobody needs to be trading clothing out there.
Guess what I just over-heard in the office. No Dr. Gregory today. Ergo those of us who blew off our Science homework . . . (shuts Willow's book) . . . are not as dumb as we look.
They didn't say anything about sick -- something about . . . missing.
Hold on, let me think, the cheerleaders were modeling the new short skirts and I kinda got . . . yeah, I think they said missing.
Which is bad.
(to Buffy) I'm really sorry. I'm sure he'll -- iya-hoo.
Egguh -- yes.
Sure. It's, uh . . . I go there everyday -- (to Buffy and Willow) -- oh god, where is it?
Funny how the earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to.
I wonder what she sees in me . . .
Probably just the quiet good looks coupled with a certain smoky magnetism.
Miss French. You two might be a little young to understand what an older woman sees in a younger man.
Good.
I'm not too dumb to . . . what surgical improvements?
Those who can, do. Those who can't laugh at those who . . . can do.
I guess that's what they call rehearsal.
I've never seen . . . I mean, I've  never seen anything like . . . that was new.
This is a question nobody particularly wants to hear, but, where did they put his head?
Why would that guy come after a teacher?
So there's something <u>else</u> out there? Besides silverware man? This is fun. We're on Monster Island.
No thanks, I never eat when I'm making egg sacks. (re: egg sack model) Wow, if these were real, the bugs'd be . . .
Yeah. So where do we start?
Forgiveness is my middle name -- actually it's LaVelle -- I'd appreciate it if you'd guard that secret with your life.
Come to . . . your place?
Right, that's important, 'cause when your hair's not down it's . . . up.
Yessss!!
Hey.
Well, it's a little demanding being her . . . absolute favorite guy in the universe, but I'll just have to  muddle through.
I know, she's so much more.
Okay.
I see. So she's not human she's . . .?
(laughs) It's not weird, it's perfectly understandable. I've met someone, you're jealous.
Nothing I could do about it. There's just a certain chemical thing between Miss French and me.
<u>SHE'S NOT AN INSECT</u>!! -- okay? She's a woman. Hard as it may be for you to conceive, a <u>human woman</u> finds me attractive. I realize she's no mystery guy handing out leather jackets -- and while we're on the subject, what kinda girly-name is Angel anyway?
Nothing! It just bugs me. (beat) I really gotta . . . (he takes off)
No, no. It's the most beautiful chest -- dress! -- I've ever seen.
(mile a minute) I like cucumbers -- you know in that Greek salad thing with the yogurt -- you like Greek food? I'm exempting schwarma here, what is that all about, big meat hive . . . (grabs glass, drains it) <u>Hehh</u>-looo.
You mean like, in the same room --
Oh, that. Well, let me think, there was . . . several, you know, I mean quite a few times that . . . and then there was . . . she was so incredibly . . . no.
You can?
Well, needs are, you know, needs should definitely be met as long as they don't require ointments the next day or --
Do you hear --
Sounds like somebody crying for --
Buffy. I love Buffy . . . wow, so that's a martini, huh?
Are you sure somebody's not --
Your hands are really . . .
. . . serrated? That drink must have, I think I need to . . .
Miss . . . French?
Yaahhhh!
Blayne --
Are you --
What? <u>What does she do</u>?
Blayne! What does she do?
What? Then what?
She . . .?
(deadpan) It's not?
Blayne . . . Blayne! Chill. Listen to me, we're gonna get out of this.
(doesn't have a clue) Let me just perfect it . . .
(hefting bar) A weapon.
(deadpan) What's she doing?
. . . moe.
(to keep her from touching him) I'm coming, I'm coming.
What, what's happening?!
Eggs? She's going to lay some . . .?
Can I just say one thing? (she seems to hesitate) <u>HEELLLLPPPP</u>!!
(to Buffy) You okay?
Just for the record, you were right, I was an idiot and God bless you.
(to Giles and Willow) And thank you guys, too.
What . . .?
Isn't this the perfect ending to a wonderful day.
Blayne -- shut up.
