Could you help me?
I'm looking for Science one oh nine.
Thank you, Blayne.
My name is Natalie French, I'll be substituting for Dr. Gregory.
No I don't . . . (looks at seating chart) Buffy. They just call and tell me where they want me.
Excuse me, Blayne?
Yes, his notes tell me you were right in the middle of insect life.
The praying mantis is a fascinating creature, forced to live alone. Who can tell me why -- Buffy?
There's nothing ugly about these unique creatures. The reason they live alone is because they're cannibals.
(to class) It's hardly their fault -- it's the way Nature designed them: noble, solitary . . .
And prolific: over eighteen hundred species worldwide. In nearly all of them the female is larger and more aggressive than the male.
The California Mantis lays her eggs and <u>then</u> finds a mate . . .
. . . to fertilize them. Once he's played his part, she covers the eggs in a protective sack and attaches them to a leaf or a twig, out of danger.
If she's done her job correctly, in a few months she'll have several hundred offspring.
We should make some model egg sacks for the Science Fair. Who'd like to help me do that after school? I warn you, it's a delicate art, I'd have to work with you very closely, one on one . . .
Keep your eyes straight ahead, on your own test . . .
I think you meant "pollination" for number fourteen.
I'll see you here after school.
Oh, hi. I was just grabbing a  snack. Can I make you something?
Big as you.
Oh Xander, I've done something really stupid, I hope you can forgive me.
(smiles then:) I have a teacher conference in half an hour and I left the paint and paper mache' at home. I don't suppose you'd want to come to my place tonight and work on it there.
It'd just be the two of us. I'd feel more comfortable there, you know, about letting my hair down.
It's a date then. Seven-thirty. (hands him paper) Here's my address. (I want you) I'll see you tonight.
Hi, come on in.
Oh, should I change, is it too . . .?
Thank you, that's sweet. Martini?
I'm sorry, would you like something else? I just need to relax a little, I'm kind of nervous around you. You're probably cool as a cucumber.
(clinks his empty glass) Cheers. (moves close) Can I ask you a personal question? Have you ever been with a woman before?
(closer still) You know what I mean.
(touching his hair, face) I know, I can tell.
I like it. You might say I need it.
No.
I don't hear anything. Your hands are so . . . (takes his hands) . . . hot.
Would you like to touch me with those hands?
