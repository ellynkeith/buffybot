Thanks to you.
You hurt your hand . . . will you still be able to . . . ?
You're drooling . . .
<u>Xander</u> . . . you've got a little . . .
Ways that ants communicate.
With other ants.
. . . touch . . . and . . . B.O.?
Well, what teenager doesn't --
That fire, there were major extenuating circumstances -- actually it's sort of funny --
(deflating) Destructo-Girl, that's me.
You mean great in a bad way?
The homework thing?
Okay. Sorry.
Uh . . . thanks?
Dr. Gregory didn't chew me out or  anything. He was really cool. But Flutie showed him my permanent record. Apparently I fall somewhere between Charles Manson and a really <u>bad</u> person.
I was fighting vampires? I'm thinking he might not believe me.
Sad, you have so many memories here. You and Lawrence, you and Mark, you and John. You spent the better part of your "J" through "M" here.
What are you doing?
(looking off) I don't believe it.
Well, look who's here.
I'd say it's nice to see you but we both know that's a big fib.
No, you'll just give me a cryptic warning about some exciting new catastrophe and then disappear into the night. Right?
You can take it.
(re: jacket) Little big on me.
What happened?
To somebody with a big fork?
The fork guy?
Okay, I give you improved marks. Ripping the throat out: non-cryptic, it's a strong visual . . .
Sweet dreams to you, too.
That's all. "Cryptic" guy said "Fork" guy.
Bright, sunny, beautiful. How can we escape this torment?
Dark, dank, dreary. You must be so  happy.
What happened, is he sick?
He's missing?
If something's wrong, yeah.
If he dropped his glasses why  didn't he pick them up?
Do you know when he's coming back?
Well, the words "bug ugly" kinda spring to mind.
Hot dog surprise . . . be still my heart.
Oh I understand.
A younger man is too dumb to wonder why an older woman can't find someone her own age and too desperate to care about the surgical improvements.
And so terribly innocent.
(taking it) No thank you.
(small voice) So did I.
Count on it.
Not a lot. He was killed on campus, I'm guessing. The same day we last saw him.
Didn't change his clothes.
Angel. He warned me something was coming.
Cut off his hand and replaced it with a fork?
Fork guy doesn't do heads.
And Dr. Gregory's blood wasn't drained.
Where was that guy killed? Weatherly Park?
Cross my heart.
Yep.
Yeah, I lied, I'm a bad person. Let's move on.
(nods) More like a jumbo claw.
And I saw something else, something much more interesting than your run-of-the-mill killer vampire.
Do you know Miss French, the teacher who's substituting for Dr. Gregory?
I'm chasing clawguy last night, we're on the street . . .
And Miss Well-Proportioned is heading home, I figure she's his next meal. He takes one look at her and runs screaming for cover.
He was petrified.
Yes! So I'm an undead monster who can shave with his hand -- how many things am I afraid of?
So what is her deal?
Then I'd better get to class.
You mean yesterday in the cafeteria, after he was --
I've gotta . . . I'll be late for biology.
I really don't need --
But I really feel okay.
(starts to leave) Mr. Flutie, I --
Great, a pop quiz.
(to Willow) No, no I'm not saying she craned her neck, it was the full-on exorcist twist.
Which reminds me, how come Blayne who worked with her "one on one" yesterday, isn't here today?
Any luck?
Try looking under "Things That Can Turn Their Heads All The Way Around".
No. Nothing human. But there's some insects that can. (beat, determined) Whatever she is, I'm gonna be ready for her.
(turns back) My homework.
Where's the books on bugs?
Dig this -- "the praying mantis can rotate it's head a hundred and eighty degrees while waiting for a  meal to wander by . . ." Hah! (off their looks) Well, come on guys. Hah!
Factoid one: only the praying mantis can turn it's head like that. Factoid two: a pretty wacked-out vampire is scared to death of her. Factoid three: her fashion sense screams predator.
Exactly.
Whosy and whatsy?
I knew that.
Let's not panic, I'll warn him. I need you to stretch your hacker muscles and see if you can get something from the Coroner's office.
Autopsy on Dr. Gregory. I've been trying to figure out the marks I saw on his corpse -- I'm thinking they might have been teeth -- and these cuddlies . . .
. . . should definitely be brushing after every meal. (to Giles) You were saying something about a beast?
Good idea.
Hey.
So how'd it go with Miss French after school?
Xander, she's not what she seems.
Look, I have to tell you some stuff about her and I really need you to listen, okay?
I don't think she's human. She can do the twisty with her head -- ever see the Exorcist? Plus Blayne, who was last seen in her class  yesterday afternoon, is now missing.
Technically I guess you'd have to call her a big old bug. (Xander smiles) I know it sounds a little weird but --
I'm not --
I know, I just read about it, it's called, uh, a pheromone, this chemical attractant insects give off.
What's that got to do with --
Xander . . .
You hurt your hand . . .
They <u>are</u> teeth marks . . . (re: mantis in text book) . . . which match perfectly the one insect that nips off its prey's head.
It's the way they feed: head first. And the way they mate -- (re: book) The female eats the male's head while they're . . .
Take it easy, Will, Xander's not in any immediate danger. I saw him leave school -- I'm sure he's safe and sound at home right now.
"It" being . . .?
Giles, while we're young.
(to Willow, comforting) Well, Xander's not a . . . I mean he's probably --
This thing is breeding. We gotta find it and snuff it. Any tips on the snuffing part?
Slice and dice.
Well, your buddy Carlyle faced it, he's still around.
Okay Admiral, way to inspire the troops.
See if you can get her address off the substitute rolls.
(to Giles) You gotta record some bat sonar, fast.
Bats eat them -- a praying mantis hears sonar, its whole nervous system goes kaplooie.
-- in the vid library. I know it's not books but it's still dark and musty, you'll be right at home.
I'll handle the armory.
Giles!
Let's roll.
Yes, that would be wrong.
I'm looking for Miss French.
Natalie French, the substitute biology teacher.
She used Miss French's records to get in the school -- <u>bite me</u>, she could be anywhere.
I saw her walking past this park. Carrying grocery bags. She lives in this neighborhood.
(stops her) We don't have time for that.
We will.
I won't be long.
Me.
Which house, where is she?
You're not afraid of much, but you're afraid of her --
-- and her cold blood . . .
Better than radar . . .
You guys coming?
Let him go.
(to the others) Get him out. The bug is mine.
Remember Dr. Gregory -- you scarfed his head? He taught me if you do your homework you learn stuff. Like what happens to your nervous system when you hear this:
Giles!
Xander, get out!
Bat sonar makes your whole nervous system go to hell. You can go there with it.
Yeah.
There is. Thanks for the tip.
Of course, it would make things easier if I knew how to get in touch with you.
Or who you where . . .
Well, anyway, you can have your jacket back.
Oh, boy . . .
