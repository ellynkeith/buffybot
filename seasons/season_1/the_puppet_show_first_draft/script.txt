CORDELIA: So, what's your act?
GIRL: I...
CORDELIA: Haven't decided, huh? Well, you'd better be along the lines of spectacular. Because I sing. (re: form) Who gets these?
GIRL: (pointing) Him.
GILES: Cursed by the wretched name of Rupert Giles.
BUFFY: How did you finagle such a primo assignment?
GILES: Our new Fuhrer Mr. Miller --
WILLOW: I think they're called ‘principals' now.
GILES: Mm-hmm. He thought it would behoove me to have more contact with the student. I tried to explain that my vocational choice of librarian was a deliberate attempt to minimize said contact. He would have none of it.
BUFFY: (with importance) Giles, into every generation is born one who must oversee the annual abomination known as the school talentless show. You can not escape your destiny.
GILES: Might I at least look forward to your participation in this even prophesied event?
BUFFY: Nah, I thought I'd take on <u>your</u> traditional role and just watch.
XANDER: And mock.
WILLOW: And laugh.
BUFFY: Let's leave Sir Andrew Lloyd Giles to this business he calls show.
MILLER: Oh, look at this: three more anxious participants for our show.
XANDER: Oh, no, sir. Thank you, though. We were just--
WILLOW: Leaving.
BUFFY: Quickly.
XANDER: Bye, now!
MILLER: No, stay. I think you could put on a wonderful act for the audience to watch. And mock. And laugh. At.
BUFFY: Looks like we just volunteered.
MILLER: Principal Flutie may have tolerated anti-social, recalcitrant behavior like yours. He was all touch-feely and weak-willed. Which explains why he was eaten by wild dogs, god rest his soul. But there's a new sheriff in town. Sunnydale High has touched and felt for the last time.
GILES: Audition forms are on the table.
WANNABE: Here's a way to save time in the morning. Unclog your toilet while practicing good hygiene.
MARIO: And so, I reach into my hat and -- abra cadabra -- pull out...
GIRL: I now present my tribute to Jimi Hendrix.
CORDELIA: ‘Isn't it ironic, don't you think? A little too ironic. Oh, yeah, I really do think.'
GILES: (cutting her off) Okay, thank you.
CORDELIA: Wait, I'm about to scream about the rain.
GILES: (forcing a smile) Surprise me later.
CORDELIA: And of course I'll be wearing a knit cap.
GILES: Goody! (off list) Okay, last up, thank goodness, is... Morgan and Sid.
MORGAN: Hi, I'm Morgan. (then, as Sid) And I'm Sid.
SID: --All right, time out. Let's stop this before someone gets hurt. Kid, you are the worst. Even I can see your lips move. On top of that, you're spitting all over me.
GILES: ...and our first rehearsal sill be tomorrow morning.  (looking at Cordelia) Some of you might want to get here early and run through your act <u>before</u> I arrive.
CORDELIA: (pointing to our gang) What about the odd squad? They didn't even audition.
GILES: I'll expect to see them here bright and early with an idea of what they want to do.
BUFFY: Not be here bright and early comes to mind.
MORGAN: (looking up) Huh? Oh, thanks.
SID: Of course I did. I told you you'd be great. Just keep letting me call the shots.
GIRL: Hello?
BUFFY: I had a beautiful dream that the two of you came up with something great for us to do in the show.
WILLOW: It's good to dream.
BUFFY: Well, every minute brings Giles closer to being here, so we'd better settle on something that vaguely resembles a talent.
XANDER: You know, talent is really such a subjective thing. What I consider to be one of my greatest talents? Other people would just call rude and offensive.
SID: Could you move my leg?
MORGAN: What's the problem, Sid?
SID: Damn shin splints.
BUFFY: Wow, Morgan, you're really getting good with that thing.
MORGAN: Oh... uh...
SID: Tell the girl thank you.
MORGAN: Thank you.
SID: Morgan's a little shy around pretty girls. But I'm not.
BUFFY: (patting Sid's head) Aw, you're sweet.
SID: (to Buffy) What say you and me do a little rehearsing of our own? I'd feel right at home sitting on your knee.
XANDER: Hey, wood-man, watch your mouth.  (then, to Morgan) I mean... watch his mouth.
SID: Sorry, pal. Just checking out the scenery. (looks Buffy up and down) And I likes what I see. (seeing Willow) Your friend ain't that bad either. Either of you ladies ever been with a dummy? Once you go wood, nothing's as good.
BUFFY: (trying to be polite) Okay, Morgan. We get the joke. Horny dummy -- ha ha. But you might think about getting some new schtick. Unless you want your best prop ending up as a Duraflame log.
SID: Ooh, feisty!
MILLER: By the way, thanks for steering this talent show ship. I owe you a debt of gratitude.
GILES: It is a cross I carry with the joy of Jesus himself.
MILLER: Ooh, don't say that around the students. Church/State matters, you know.
GILES: I'll be careful.
MILLER: (looks at the students) I've got to say, this place isn't nearly as bad as I was told. I'd heard reports of mysterious gang activity, witchery, the occasional case of spontaneous cheerleader combustion. But I'm beginning to think those were just rumors. I haven't seen any of that.
BUFFY: Who found the body?
GILES: The custodian. She was cleaning the locker room--
BUFFY: They clean this place?
GILES: Every other month. (looks over notes) The girl's crossed-country coach said she never showed for last night's meet at Mehlville. The detectives surmise the murder occurred after the talent show auditions.
BUFFY: Any gory details?
GILES: The goriest. Alice's heart was removed.
BUFFY: That deserves an ‘ick.'
GILES: And it's missing.
BUFFY: Ditto.
GILES: So we're looking at a myriad of possibilities: vampires, a ritual sacrifice. Or it might be the work of any number of your garden variety creatures with a taste for humanity.
BUFFY: But it's definitely of the genus supernatural.
GILES: It seems to be. And it somehow managed to pass into the school undetected.
BUFFY: (shaking her head) We've got to tighten our admission standards.
XANDER: How jaded has our school become when you don't even get the day off after a brutal murder? I bet most other places, that's an automatic. But no! We forge on.
BUFFY: Still stressed about the talent show, huh?
XANDER: They could have at least canceled <u>that</u>. You know, to say, ‘Hey, we understand.'
WILLOW: Mr. Miller said we're supposed to carry on in Alice's memory.
BUFFY: How about we do a scene from a piece of classic theater.
WILLOW: Forsooth! The song of Shakespeare beats within my breast!
BUFFY: Maybe we should sticketh with something American.
WILLOW: Okey-dokey.
SID: ...Right now you and me got to be on the lookout. Figure out who's going to be next.
MORGAN: How are we supposed to--
BUFFY: (suspicious) Hello...
MORGAN: I was, uh, just working on throwing my voice.
WILLOW: (tentative) Wow. Pretty good.
MORGAN: Thanks.
BUFFY: Morgan, did you--
MORGAN: (nervous) Weird? What do you mean?
BUFFY: With Alice. Did she say anything to you? Was she arguing with anyone?
MORGAN: No. She was dancing. Sid and I were talking.
WILLOW: Talking?
MORGAN: Rehearsing.
BUFFY: So you didn't see or hear anything at all?
SID: Look, hot-pants, he answered your questions. Leave him alone.
XANDER: Oh, how nice. Company.
SID: (to Buffy) Now, if you want to take me into the box and work <u>me</u> over--
BUFFY: Morgan, that's getting a little old. How about talking to me yourself?
SID: He's said all he[‘s] going to say.
MORGAN: It's okay, Sid. We're done.
BUFFY: I didn't mean to make you mad.
MORGAN: No, I'm-- it's him. He's...
WILLOW: Cute couple...
TEACHER: It was a result of this that President Monroe put forth the eponymous -- meaning named after one's self -- Monroe Doctrine, which in one sense established the U.S. as a local peace keeper..
CORDELIA: (leaning in to Buffy) Looks like someone digs you. That's adorable. You and the dummy could tour in the freak show.
TEACHER: Okay, who can tell me how Spain responded to this policy? Morgan?
MORGAN: What?
TEACHER: Spain's position?
MORGAN: Oh, um...
SID: Wouldn't that be somewhere down and to the left of England?
TEACHER: Give me your puppet.
MORGAN: I'll put him away.
TEACHER: You'll get it back at the end of the day.
TEACHER: Morgan, that is enough.
TEACHER: Morgan, could I see you for a moment, please?
MORGAN: Yes?
TEACHER: I wanted to ask you, is everything okay? At home? Here at school?
MORGAN: Yeah. Why?
TEACHER: I feel like lately you've become... a little detached. You're not participating as much, you're goofing off, disrupting class...
MORGAN: Uh-huh.
TEACHER: You're one of the brightest kids I've seen in a long time. But lately it seems like you're not all ‘there.' Don't let this talent show stuff get in the way of your school work, okay?
MORGAN: Is that all?
TEACHER: That's all.
GILES: Sid was staring at you?
BUFFY: No. Morgan made it-- he had Sid turned so that he was facing me.
GILES: Staring at you.
BUFFY: Yes.
WILLOW: And to turn the creepy quotient up to eleven, Morgan's always referring to himself as Sid and ‘us' and ‘we,' like they're locker partners or something.
BUFFY: It's as if he thinks Sid is alive.
XANDER: He's not the only one.
GILES: Xander, did you wish to join our palaver?
XANDER: Well, earlier, in the auditorium--
BUFFY: (to Giles) You're going to love this.
XANDER: I think I saw Sid move.
GILES: All me to do a double-take: what?
XANDER: When Morgan was putting Sid in his case.
GILES: What did he do, wave?
XANDER: It was nothing that obvious. It's hard to explain. I saw him... <u>after</u> he moved. You know, like he <u>had</u> moved.
GILES: So in other words you saw him laying there. Perfectly still.
XANDER: Well, no. He was... It was the way that- (then, ashamed) Yes.
WILLOW: (comforting Xander) But you get bonus points for conviction.
GILES: While there have been numerous accounts of dolls being possessed by evil spirits--
XANDER: There you go!
GILES: --a more likely scenario is that we're dealing with a form of schizophrenia.
XANDER: That's more likely.
GILES: Morgan's id is being represented by a vessel that allows his innermost fantasies to be revealed.
BUFFY: Yeah, I figured that out when Sid tried to look up my dress.
GILES: Unfortunately, Morgan may have gone one step further into the harvesting of human organs under the misguided belief that this will bring his puppet to life. The Geppeto Complex, if you will.
XANDER: Do you actually know this stuff, or do you make it up as you go along?
GILES: It is fun, isn't it? (then) Perhaps some of your talent show castmates have information which might help us prove our theory.
WILLOW: We're on it.
BUFFY: Maybe I can turn up something in Morgan's locker: a photo of Alice, a book about Pinocchio, a fresh human heart. The usual stuff
BUFFY: Why are you following--
SID: I knew I could count on you.
MORGAN: Shouldn't we stick together?
SID: You need to be by yourself.
MORGAN: When do you want me to--
SID: Soon. I'll know when the time is right.
BUFFY: Okay, three to the right, two to the left--
BUFFY: Got it.
BUFFY: Morgan.
MORGAN: What are you doing?
BUFFY: (gently) Morgan, it's over. We need to get you some help.
MORGAN: I don't need help.
BUFFY: I've seen you. Whispering to your dummy when there's no one around. Pretending he's a real person. Telling Sid you'll kill for him.
MORGAN: No, it's --
BUFFY: He's not real. He's just wood.
MORGAN: Cut it out.
BUFFY: Look--
MORGAN: (gritting his teeth) He doesn't like that.
BUFFY: He's not alive! He's a doll!
SID: Leave him alone!
BUFFY: Morgan, stop that. Talk to me.
SID: Morgan's not talking now. I am.
BUFFY: (ignoring Sid) I'm not speaking to that thing--
SID: (to Buffy; taunting) I've been watching you. I know what you're up to--
MORGAN: Sid--
BUFFY: Morgan--
SID: You can play hide-and-seek all you want, but it won't do any good--
MORGAN: Sid--
SID: You're getting careless. It's just a matter of time before--
MORGAN: Sid, please--
SID: (turns on Morgan) SHUT UP!
BUFFY: Maybe it'd be best if you just gave that to me...
MORGAN: I can't do that.
BUFFY: Let me help you.
SID: She's not your friend, Morgan. <u>I'm</u> your friend.
BUFFY: Don't listen to him.
MORGAN: No!
BUFFY: Mr. Miller.
MILLER: One thing about running in the halls? I'm against it.
BUFFY: Sorry. I'm... late for class.
MILLER: Busted. School's out.
BUFFY: Really? Boy, these days just zip by, don't they?
MILLER: I will not allow delinquency in my halls. This sort of thing leads to the kind of incident that occurred last night. If my predecessor had clamped down on such infractions, maybe he wouldn't have been eaten by wild dogs.
BUFFY: There's probably some truth there.
MILLER: Where's the fire, anyway?
BUFFY: It's out.
GILES: Here's the rundown for the show. We'll have our final rehearsal this evening, then raise the curtain tomorrow night at eight.
BUFFY: Hey, Mr. Producer. How goes the talent biz?
GILES: You know, a few days ago, I would have rather bathed with a Gila monster than taken on this task.
BUFFY: Then you should speak up next time.
GILES: But it's become refreshing. You and I deal with so much darkness and death. The stage is an escape. It's like another world.
GILES: A world where divas have replaced the undead.
GIRL: (to Cordelia) Define the problem.
CORDELIA: I'm, like, the headliner. I should be last. I can't be sandwiched between the juggling ‘Brothers Carry-My-Stuff' and Tootie and her Psychic Pit Bull.
WANNABE: The Pit Bull is pretty good.
CORDELIA: This is unacceptable.
GILES: Cordelia, there's no ‘I' in ‘talent show.'
CORDELIA: There's a big one in ‘Cordelia.'
GILES: It's all about pacing. You need a passionate come-down after the jugglers and an emotional hand-off to the pit bull. Otherwise it's just bananas on bananas.
CORDELIA: Oh. So, really, the star <u>should</u> go on third.
GILES: (whatever it takes) All right.
BUFFY: (impatient) Uh-huh. So, anyway, there's this killer on the loose?
GILES: Yes, of course. Any sign of him... er, them? Morgan?
BUFFY: Nope. Not since our little mano-a-mannequin in the hallway. And I looked for him all night.
GILES: I'm afraid he may have been out hunting for his next victim.
BUFFY: Which is exactly what he thinks Sid told him to do.
XANDER: Buffy, it's Morgan.
BUFFY: I know. He's crazy.
WILLOW: He's dead.
BUFFY: Okay. A girl is found mutilated in the school locker room. At the exact same time, a fiercely intelligent loner befriends a wooden dummy, who speaks with a mind of his own and instructs said loner to kill. Coincidence? Apparently so!
XANDER: Things did seem pretty written on Morgan's shirt.
BUFFY: Or maybe suspecting him was just the easiest thing to do.
WILLOW: Buffy, we all thought he was psycho. Everyone in the talent show told us a different story about how weird he was.
XANDER: Yeah. You see a kid, you see a dummy, you see the dummy whisper in the kid's ear, you think crazy kid
BUFFY: Maybe so, but... you know how people look at the three of us?
WILLOW: Oh, yeah.
BUFFY: That look that says they're seeing someone who's different, not like them, and it scares them? I could live forever without seeing that again. But I think it's the exact same look we used to give Morgan. We never even gave him a chance.
GILES: Well, this is most gruesome.
BUFFY: Another missing heart?
GILES: No, a brain. Morgan's skull was severed.
XANDER: I'm thinking that must have hurt.
WILLOW: Did they find the vessel which served as Morgan's unspoken id? (off Giles) Sometimes what you say seeps in.
GILES: I tried to get as much information about that as I could. But when I asked the authorities if they found a puppet near the body, they quite rudely asked me to leave.
BUFFY: So that's probably a no.
GILES: Which is odd. Because I was under the impression that Morgan and Sid were inseparable.
BUFFY: They were.
GILES: I never thought I'd say these words, but Xander may be right.
XANDER: I'll expect a formal letter of apology in the morning.
GILES: The dummy has a mind of its own.
XANDER: Hey!
BUFFY: He means Sid.
XANDER: He means Sid.
GILES: Sid hopes to become human, so he's harvesting body parts -- the best one's available. Morgan was the smartest kid in school, and Alice's heart would have been most healthy.
WILLOW: More guts, more glory?
GILES: That's one way to put it.
BUFFY: All right, wait. So as of now we're ruling out any suspect who is living, breathing, body-dwelling -- let's say for argument's sake, an actual human being -- in favor of the theory that these murders, where vital organs were removed with great precision, were committed by a piece of wood.
GILES: That's correct.
BUFFY: I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.
GILES: Delightful. If I could just have everyone's attention before we break for the night.
XANDER: (to Buffy) What's he talking about?
BUFFY: Not a clue.
WILLOW: He's been under a lot of stress.
GILES: Therefore, when you take to the stage, let us not forget that we perform in memory of our friend Morgan.
WANNABE: I thought we were doing this in memory of Alice?
GILES: Her, too. Very well, then. Until tomorrow.
WILLOW: You coming, Buffy?
BUFFY: Yeah. I've just got to find my bag. I thought it was right here. (calling over) I'll catch up.
BUFFY: Hello?
BUFFY: Mr. Miller.
MILLER: Rehearsal over?
BUFFY: Just ended.
MILLER: Yet you're still here.
BUFFY: I was looking for something.
MILLER: Of course.
BUFFY: I was just leaving.
MILLER: All right then. (switching gears) Well, break a leg! I mean, don't, actually... you know.
BUFFY: I know.
MILLER: (pointing) Is that your bag?
BUFFY: Yeah. Thanks.
BUFFY: Mr. Miller?
BUFFY: Whoever is there, I'm going to hurt you. Badly. (then, to herself) If you'll just give me a minute.
SID: It's payback time!
BUFFY: I should have known it was you!
SID: You <u>always</u> knew it was me!
BUFFY: Ow!
SID: The end.
BUFFY: My parts belong to me!
BUFFY: You've killed for the last time.
BUFFY: Yes. Quite.
SID: Go ahead. But there will be others to come and destroy you.
BUFFY: I've gotten rid of vampires, evil robots, and one really big bug. I'm not exactly shaking in my hip boots at the threats of some dime-store dummy.
SID: I didn't choose this package. That was your doing.
BUFFY: You know, much as I hate these moments when the good guy allows the bad guy to talk on and on in a pathetic attempt to save his own life, I've got to ask: what the hell are you talking about?
SID: You won. You can take your heart and your brain and move on.
BUFFY: I'm sure they would have made great trophies for your case.
SID: That would have been justice.
BUFFY: Yeah, except for one thing--
SID: Neither will you.
SID: What?
BUFFY: We know the M.O.
SID: We get a call about a crime in progress. I burst in on this guy standing over his victim. Only this guy ain't no guy. He's got flesh hanging off his face, eyes like the devil, scales covering every inch of his body.
GILES: A humanoid demon.
SID: Two-points for the egghead. So this thing takes off; I chase it into the darkness. <u>Big</u> rookie mistake.
XANDER: Is this story going to end anywhere near "And that's why I'm a puppet"?
SID: Hold on to your huevos, Opie. We're finally face to face in this magic shop. He jumps me; I pump him full of bullets. He's this close to death when he starts jabbering at me like a catholic priest. Apparently, he thought it'd be cute to curse my soul into the nearest object. (spreading his arms wide) Ta-da! (then) Just my luck -- I couldn't have chased him into a brothel.
XANDER: And...?
SID: What?
XANDER: Where's the part about when you spent the night in a whale and wished upon a star?
SID: Excuse me, that was Pinocchio. He was a marionette. With strings. (pissed off) That punk has done more harm to people like me than Mortimer Snerd.  (then) I am a ventriloquist's partner.
XANDER: Didn't they used to call you guys ‘Dummies?'
SID: Yeah, and I'm sure they used to call you ‘retarded,' but I bet you prefer ‘slow.'
BUFFY: Boys, let's not fight.
WILLOW: (to Sid) So what happened to the demon?
SID: Apparently, he went on to lead a happy and successful life. Because seven years later in Chicago, the same crimes start happening.
GILES: How did you know?
SID: Hey, I read! And I got real interested in this guy. He's been kicking around since the early 14th century, when he got banished from his own little corner of hell after he took the heart and brain of his master's human bride. Seems he wanted to be able to roan the earth like you and me. Now, every seven years, he has to do another slice-and-dice, and every time he does that, he takes on a new human form.
GILES: I must say, it's a delightful change to have someone else around who can explain these matters.
SID: So I track the demon down, I finally figure out it's here, and my first thought is-- (pointing at Buffy) --it's you.
BUFFY: Then those knife slashes to my face weren't just a ‘getting-to-know-you' kind of thing?
SID: Who can blame me for thinking? Look at you. You're strong. Athletic... (getting lost in thought) Limber. Nubile. (snapping out of it) I'm back. And you're always sneaking around. I just assumed.
BUFFY: Yeah, well, I kind of played the stereotype against you, too.
SID: You thought I was an evil puppet.
BUFFY: No, I thought you were a lifeless piece of wood.
SID: The only way this wood becomes lifeless is if I cut that demon's heart right out of its chest.
GILES: Ah, and then the curse will be lifted and you will be free...
SID: Something like that.
WILLOW: So what's the next move?
SID: Don't know. This monster's got everything it needs, and I still have no idea who it is. Hopefully, I can track it down before it kills again.
BUFFY: Let me help. With your brains and my -- being human, we could get this guy.
SID: No. I already got Morgan killed. I'm not going to chance it with you.
BUFFY: Hey, I've fought--
SID: I know, I know. Draculas, insects, Rock'em Sock'ems--
BUFFY: And I'm one of the few people who knows what you're going through. We've both seen evil, and we both know how to fight it.
SID: You have no idea what evil is. You have no idea what's out there. From now on, I work alone.
XANDER: Okay, I'll be the first to say it. We just had a long, level-headed, fairly intelligent conversation...
WILLOW: He prefers the term ‘partner.'
XANDER: Then ‘he' is a dummy!
GILES: (admiringly) With quite a grasp regarding the intricacies of the supernatural.
BUFFY: Poor Sid. Can you imagine the kind of life he must lead?
WILLOW: Cursed for fifty years in the body of a wooden doll.
GILES: Traveling from town to town in his obsessive search for an elusive prey.
WILLOW: Living out of a suitcase. Heck, living <u>in</u> a suitcase.
XANDER: Having to explain to people over and over again... (dawning) With amazing detail that almost sounded rehear-- (then) Does anyone else get the feeling we may have just been Keyser Soze'd?
BUFFY: What'er who'd?
XANDER: Didn't all that sound a bit neat, tidy, and convenient?
WILLOW: Maybe a little.
XANDER: Not to mention -- how should I put this -- preposterous? I mean, a <u>good</u> dummy?
GILES: I will say that in the cases I've studies, most dolls are possessed by evil, not good, spirits.
XANDER: Most?
GILES: Well, all.
BUFFY: Sid did seem a little restless.
GILES: He certainly left in a hurry.
WILLOW: And if anyone has a great poker face...
BUFFY: Sid was right. We'll never see him again.
GILES: Fifteen minutes to curtain, everyone. Fifteen minutes. Set your props and we'll assemble in the band room for a power circle.
GIRL: I forgot to buff my tuba.
GILES: (handing her his handkerchief) Here. Use this.
CORDELIA: (short of breath) I can't go on. All those people. Staring at me and judging me like I'm some kind of... Buffy. What if I mess up?
GILES: Cordelia, there's an adage that, if you're nervous, just imagine your audience in their skivvies.
CORDELIA: (thinking) Boxers or briefs?
GILES: You decide.
WANNABE: Mr. Giles, I can't find my watermelon. It's the centerpiece for my ‘Crush-o-Rama' routine.
GILES: Elliot, I warned you about the dangers of prop humor.
WILLOW: Hey, that scarf would be perfect.
XANDER: Actually, being on a Hellmouth and all makes this kind of thing even funnier.
WILLOW: Just get me that scarf and let's get out of here.
XANDER: What?
WILLOW: Do you hear something?
XANDER: Um...
XANDER: Why would this brain have been rejected? I thought Morgan was the smartest kid in school.
WILLOW: He was. Look at his grades -- all A's. He was even taking college classes. (then) Wait a second.
BUFFY: What?
WILLOW: All these sick days.
XANDER: He's been out, like, half the year.
BUFFY: Check the school nurse's file.
WILLOW: Look at this. Medicine, physical therapy. (then, reading) ‘In case of emergency, contact Dr. Dale Leggett, California Institute of Neuro Surgery - Cancer Ward.'
BUFFY: (reading) ‘Patient's condition is terminal.'
XANDER: Brain cancer?
WILLOW: He never told anyone.
BUFFY: This means that whatever is out there still needs a healthy, intelligent brain--
XANDER: In other words, I'm safe.
BUFFY: --and it's going to be looking for the smartest person around.
GILES: ...And then, if you calibrate this unit as a counterweight, the rate of descent will be maximized on impact.
MARIO: Gee, Mr. Giles. You're really smart.
BUFFY: Giles!
GILES: Oh, my...
MARIO: Pretty cool, huh?
GILES: Actually, it looks quite excruciating.
MARIO: Yeah, it does. This'll be great.
GILES: (examining guillotine) How does this work, exactly?
MARIO: A good magician never tells his secret.
GILES: And there's no one else to assist you?
MARIO: I only work with the best.
GILES: (confused) Face up?
MARIO: Yeah. You'll see the blade coming right at you.
GILES: Shouldn't it be aimed at my neck?
MARIO: No. This way, your scalp will be sliced off and your brains will just come pouring out.
GILES: Well, what exactly is the trick?
MARIO: Trick?
BUFFY: Ew...
GILES: Get me out of this thing!
XANDER: Where's the key?
GILES: Mario has it.
XANDER: He's busy.
WILLOW: Here, this'll work.
GILES: (to Willow) Hurry, now. Hurry!
BUFFY: Let go!
GILES: Well...
XANDER: Unnecessary. And kind of icky.
GILES: In any case, good show.
SID: And now for the big finish.
BUFFY: What are you doing?
SID: It's not enough. He'll come back. You need the heart. Then all this will be over.
BUFFY: Let me.
SID: No. I got to do it. Like the bookworm said, it's the only way I can be free.
BUFFY: You mean dead.
SID: Same thing.
BUFFY: (to no one in particular) It's over.
MILLER: What's going on back here? There's an audience out there waiting for a talent show to begin.
GILES: We had some... technical difficulties.
MILLER: Get this placed cleaned up. If these last few days are any indication of what used to go on around here, maybe it's a good thing my predecessor was eaten by wild dogs.
GILES: It's showtime.
WILLOW: (as Stella) Blanche, there are things that happen between a man and a woman in the dark -- that sort of makes everything else seem -- unimportant.
BUFFY: (as Blanche) What you are talking about is brutal desire -- just -- Desire! -- the name of that rattle-trap street-car that bangs through the Quarter, up one old narrow street and down another...
XANDER: (as Stanley, calling into the wings) Stella!
WILLOW: Haven't you ever ridden on the street-car?
BUFFY: It brought me here, where I'm not wanted any where I'm ashamed to be.
XANDER: Stel-la!
BUFFY: This is how I look at it. A man like that is someone to go out with -- once -- twice -- three times when the devil is in you. But live with? Have a child by?
XANDER: STEL-LAHHH!
WILLOW: I have told you I love him.
BUFFY: Then I tremble for you! -- I just -- tremble for you...
WILLOW: What are you going to do with him?
BUFFY: I don't know. It's just, after everything we've been through, I thought I'd hang on to him for a while. As sort of a reminder.
XANDER: Of what?
BUFFY: That I'm not the only one.
