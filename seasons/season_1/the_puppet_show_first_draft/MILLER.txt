Oh, look at this: three more anxious participants for our show.
No, stay. I think you could put on a wonderful act for the audience to watch. And mock. And laugh. At.
Principal Flutie may have tolerated anti-social, recalcitrant behavior like yours. He was all touch-feely and weak-willed. Which explains why he was eaten by wild dogs, god rest his soul. But there's a new sheriff in town. Sunnydale High has touched and felt for the last time.
By the way, thanks for steering this talent show ship. I owe you a debt of gratitude.
Ooh, don't say that around the students. Church/State matters, you know.
(looks at the students) I've got to say, this place isn't nearly as bad as I was told. I'd heard reports of mysterious gang activity, witchery, the occasional case of spontaneous cheerleader combustion. But I'm beginning to think those were just rumors. I haven't seen any of that.
One thing about running in the halls? I'm against it.
Busted. School's out.
I will not allow delinquency in my halls. This sort of thing leads to the kind of incident that occurred last night. If my predecessor had clamped down on such infractions, maybe he wouldn't have been eaten by wild dogs.
Where's the fire, anyway?
Rehearsal over?
Yet you're still here.
Of course.
All right then. (switching gears) Well, break a leg! I mean, don't, actually... you know.
(pointing) Is that your bag?
What's going on back here? There's an audience out there waiting for a talent show to begin.
Get this placed cleaned up. If these last few days are any indication of what used to go on around here, maybe it's a good thing my predecessor was eaten by wild dogs.
