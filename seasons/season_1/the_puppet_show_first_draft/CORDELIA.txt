So, what's your act?
Haven't decided, huh? Well, you'd better be along the lines of spectacular. Because I sing. (re: form) Who gets these?
‘Isn't it ironic, don't you think? A little too ironic. Oh, yeah, I really do think.'
Wait, I'm about to scream about the rain.
And of course I'll be wearing a knit cap.
(pointing to our gang) What about the odd squad? They didn't even audition.
(leaning in to Buffy) Looks like someone digs you. That's adorable. You and the dummy could tour in the freak show.
I'm, like, the headliner. I should be last. I can't be sandwiched between the juggling ‘Brothers Carry-My-Stuff' and Tootie and her Psychic Pit Bull.
This is unacceptable.
There's a big one in ‘Cordelia.'
Oh. So, really, the star <u>should</u> go on third.
(short of breath) I can't go on. All those people. Staring at me and judging me like I'm some kind of... Buffy. What if I mess up?
(thinking) Boxers or briefs?
