I implore you, Neisa, blessed goddess of chance and fortune, heed my call: Send to me the heart I desire...
That wasn't magic. I was praying. (then) Two, please.
(funnin') Whatcha got in the boxes? Drugs? (then, real concerned) It's not drugs, is it? Xander?!
Nah, thanks. Those things usually taste kinda tasteless. And leave a bad aftertasteless taste.
Guess she's off with Riley. You know how it is with a spanking new boyfriend.
Well, they seem to fall into the good guy camp. They are anti-demon. (re Anya) But probably pro-ex-demon.
Like a normal person's. Light on the action-packed. Hope tonight's plans aren't too much of a letdown for you, excitement-wise. (then) You remember about tonight, right?
You've been busy. Fighting armies and stuff. Not to mention other distractions of a more romantic--
(watching her watch him) You want to let him know you're here?
Well, spent most of it at Xander's, teaching Anya to play poker.
Yeah, except for the Anya part and the poker part.
Everyone's gettin' spanked but me.
Nothing.
I've been trying to find a dolls-eye crystal my entire life. (then) Well, since June, anyway. Where'd you get it?
Oh, no. Tara, that's really sweet. But I can't. It's like a family heirloom. I just wouldn't feel comfortable.
But, if you wanted to try out some spells with it sometime, I wouldn't say no.
Tonight. That sounds really nice, but tonight... I've already got plans. With people. Other.
Absolutely. It's just that it's kind of a specific crowd and you might feel out of place.
I'll see you later, okay?
Okay, another no sale, but he's doing better.
He's on a roll.
Go? You can't go. Buffy hasn't gotten here yet.
She is. She told me she was looking forward to quality time with just us. (spotting her) See? Here she comes. (then) With Riley. (then) And some other guys.
No, no, of course not. The more, the... more.
(shaking her head) I'm good.
She's a little antsy around commando- types. Ex-demon issues.
That's neat about the celebrating but... this was just supposed to be, you know... us. The Scooby core. I mean, I could've invited someone else if I knew it was going to be an open free-for-all.
(caught off-guard) What?
(nervously) No, not-- No one. I mean, I meant a hypothetical someone. Which is to say no one. (quickly) What are we celebrating?
(unsure how she feels) That's really, again I say, neat. So, what do you mean, exactly -- You've joined them?
Buffy, do you really think this is a good idea? I mean, don't you think you're rushing things a little?
Not with Riley. With the Initiative. There's a bunch of stuff about them we still don't know.
Like, what's their ultimate agenda? I mean, okay, they neuter vampires and demons - then, what? They going to reintegrate them into society? Get them jobs as bagboys at Walmart?
Plus, don't forget, there's that whole three-fourteen thing Ethan told Giles about.
Bad info or not, Buffy, I think you should be asking some questions before you go off to enlist.
When did you get a pager? (re other beeps) What's going--
I know. Talk later.
Funny thing happened with my prior social engagement. Pretty much ended when a friend of mine went off to do something with... another crowd she hangs out with. (beat) Irony is kind of ironic that way.
Anyway, I know it's late, but I thought... I mean, if you still wanted to... do something.
Oh. Hi.
(indicating Buffy's made bed) You, too.
Yeah, that's... I'm... Don't... worry about it.
They keep you hopping, don't they?
Hello?
Just left. Beeped away by her new buds. Want me to go after her?
Really? What do you want me to do? 
(incanting) "Tropo, strato, meso... Aero, iono, exo..."
(incanting) "Elements are brought to bear... Wind, earth and water churned amidst the fire. Let the air be burned..."
(eyeing others) Feels - and looks - like the ionizing spell's wearing off.
