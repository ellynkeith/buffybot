Yes, careless of me. Tracking mud all over your mud.
While I'd love to go on trading jabs with you, Spike, perhaps I'll just get to the point. Much as it pains me to say it, I owe you a debt of gratitude for the help you provided me during my recent... metamorphosis.
Three hundred dollars. Count it, if you'd like.
Thinking about your affliction -- as well as your newly discovered ability to fight only demons. It occurs to me - and I realize it's against your nature - but have you considered there may be a higher purpose--
