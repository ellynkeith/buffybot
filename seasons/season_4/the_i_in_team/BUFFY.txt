(modestly, to Maggie) I was just lucky.
I was being modest with the "luck" thing. You got that, right?
...so then Professor Walsh says something like "You're as amazing as Riley said" and later Riley told me she couldn't stop talking about the move I made when I used one of the commando guys as a shield to block a taser blast -- that's like twelve- thousand volts, took the guy almost two hours to recover. (takes a sip) And how was your night?
Bronze. The gang. You kidding? I'm so there. I miss you guys. We haven't spent any time together lately.
(unhearing, seeing something) Look, Riley just walked in.
Nah, I'm just enjoying a good stare. Tell me more about your night.
(still staring) Well that sounds fun.
Will, I think you're gonna have to get used to -- oh! A twinkie? That's his lunch? He is so gonna be punished.
What?
I know.
I'm ready. I want to do it.
(tinny/filtered) Remind me to ask Professor Walsh  how she keeps her secret underground elevators so sparkling white.
Took a tour of Washington D.C. with my parents once when I was eight. I got lost in the Smithsonian.
My mind's a blank.
My god... You said it was big. You told me. But you never said it was... HUGE.
I had no idea, this is incredible. Not that I thought this was some, I don't know, fly-by-night operation... (then) Unless it is. I mean, if you guys fly. At night. With those jetpack things. Have you got those?
It's unreal.
(meekly) Yeah. It's very... clean.
(not thrilled) Oh. And here I was thinking I'd never get homework from you again.
(re demons) What do you call those?
Behavior modification?
I've seen.
(backpedaling; pretty gracefully) On the Discovery Channel. With gorillas. Or sharks. They made them all nice, you never saw that? (she crosses away) What's over here?
(looking closer) What is it?
Um, what's in there?
(re pager) Oh, hey, I was thinking about getting one of these--
Right.
Hey, all. Sorry about the late-itude.
Coke, please.
Anya seems a bit on edge.
Oh. Riley and his friends were throwing a little impromptu celebration in my honor. Made it, like, impossible, not to invite them.
Sorry. Didn't realize it was such a big deal. My total bad. (then) Who did you want to invite?
You said you wanted to invite someone.
(sotto) I'm in! The Initiative! Professor Walsh gave me the grand tour -- and we're talking Grand as in Canyon. You'd never believe the size of it.
No. Not exactly. It just means now when I patrol, I'll have a heavily armed team backing me up. Plus, boyfriend going to work with me, a  big extra perk.
I thought you liked Riley.
I know that. (then) Like, what?
Does Walmart have bagboys?
And I always say a man who worships chaos and tries to kill you is a man you can trust.
Will...
Why exactly can't we damage this Polka thing's arms? (then) Not that I want to. Just, in my experience, when you're fighting for your life, body parts get damaged. And better its bits than mine. (re commandos) Or ours.
What do they want?
Why are they here? Sacrifices, treasure -- or are they just gettin' rampage-y? 'Cause it's easier to predict their responses if --
Oh, you mean, the camouflage and stuff. Thought about it, but on me, it's gonna look all Private Benjamin. Don't worry. I've patrolled in this blouse lots of times.
So I guess she hates me now.
Professor Walsh. The questions. An Initiative faux pas, yes?
Really?
You think maybe I should get her a present or some--
Right. Right. (then, after a beat) What do you mean Professor Walsh liked me before you did? You didn't like me?
Riley!
So... what do you want to do now?
I never know what to expect.
Your robot bird sounds hungry.
You're kidding?
You're quite the regimental soldier.
They? Who "they?"
What did they tell you it was for?
I don't understand. Aren't you curious about all this science and research stuff they're doing?
What's three-fourteen?
What is it?
You're really not one for asking questions, are you?
Morning. (then) Out all night, huh?
Yep.
Sorry, about bailing on you guys at the Bronze...
'kay.
Yeah. Gotta go. See you.
No, it's fine. I'm up for some action.
Class 3?
Wow. You're not crazy about raccoons, huh?
Hey, danger is my birthright.
You know, Professor Walsh, there's still some things about all this that I'm not clear on.
Good, okay. When I get back. (pause) Uh, am I supposed to salute you?
'Kay.
Professor Walsh, are you getting this? That possible HST -- make it a definite. And he's brought a friend. They're--
(on monitors) Hello, Professor Walsh...
(on monitors) That simple little recon you asked me to do? Wasn't a raccoon. Turns out it was me trapped in a sewer with a faulty weapon and two of your pet demons on my hands. If you think that's enough to kill me you really don't know what a slayer is. Trust me when I say you're gonna find out.
It's not safe for any of us.
