(agitated) Yes, yes… all right. Heard you the first time.
Hello. Sorry about the robe…  getting a bit of a late start.
(covering manfully) Oh, quite well. Probably have  a bit of a brisk jog later…
(weakly) Did you want something?
Of course. Come in.
Were you planning on… working here? (wincing a little) Typing and… talking… because  that would be fine.
Can I offer you something?  Some breakfast?
Yes, lunch. Which comes after breakfast.
Right. Good luck with that.
You know, Spike can be quite  convincing when he -- I'm very stupid.
Of course. Piffle. Let's move on.

Perhaps a paralyzing spell. But I'm  afraid I can't do the incantation for one of those -

(somewhat sheepishly) <i>Magic</i> gourd.
Exactly how do you plan to get close  enough to Adam to remove his power source?
Buffy, in order to perform the  enjoining ritual we're going to  need a place that's close to you and quiet.
Are you sure?
It … should do.
Five minutes, give or take.
Sophus… Mind…
Well, yes. Thank you. But  your heroism is slightly muted  by the fact that you were helping  Adam start a war that would <u>kill us all</u>.
Buffy!
