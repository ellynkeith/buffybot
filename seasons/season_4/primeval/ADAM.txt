Your thoughts are troubled.  In turmoil. I understand,  brother. We have a lot to discuss.
Speak.
Nothing. It was Mother -  your Professor Walsh.  She implanted the behavior modifier.
Actually, the chip is here.  Tied directly into your central  nervous system through the  thoracic nerve. This is phase  one of your preparation. It  lay dormant until the time  came. I simply activated it, brother.
Sit.
You have no power.
Not yet. Once you forget your  old life and embrace your destiny  as I have, you'll know power  you've never dreamed of. (considers) I think you're going to like it.
Demons cling to old ways  and ancient feuds. And they're hopeless with technology. Unworthy.
Disappointed by demonkind,  we turn to humans. Smart,  adaptive, but emotional and weak.  Blind. There is imperfection  everywhere. Something must  be done. Who will deliver us?
Mother. She creates me -  demon strength, human will,  high-grade titanium. Evolution  through technology. I am the new  standard for all living beings and  our mother knew that. She saw  our future, yours and mine.
She saw that you are necessary.  She saw the role you will play  by my side. Stand up.
You see, we <u>are</u> brothers, after all.
I didn't send for you, Spike.
I activated his chip.
You get <u>yours</u> out when the  Slayer is where I want her.
That's how I want her. <u>Where</u>  I want her is down in the Initiative. (to Riley) She will ensure that as many demons  die as humans. She will achieve  maximum carnage before she is  too weak to go on.
(calmly) Stop talking.
The witch?
Her friend.
One of the friends from whom you  have so efficiently separated her.
So, you failed.
Go.
This is where it will all happen.  Where the new race begins.
In the Initiative. There are areas  nobody knew about, beyond those  who needed to. Mother kept her  secrets well…
(to Walsh) Didn't you? (to Riley) This is all as she planned it.  Except she thought she would be alive…
They are just workers. You  know your destiny is greater.
She's coming. I can feel it.
When she's here.
She's not alone.
You failed me again.
What's the other way?
I suppose... Yes - I will honor our agreement and remove your chip. (to Forrest) Take his head off.
Let him go.
There's nowhere left to run.
This will be interesting.
You should be fighting the  demons. Evening the kill ratio.
Oh. (to Forrest/simply) Kill her.
Mother always knew you were  going to prove to be a threat to her work.
Got another.
I've been upgrading.
You can't last much longer.
Interesting.
Very … interesting.
How… can you…?
