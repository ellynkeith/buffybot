This was an experiment. The  Initiative represented the government's  interest in not only controlling the  Otherworldly Menace, but in  harnessing its power for our  own military purposes. It is  the considered opinion of this  council that the experiment has failed.
It is therefore our recommendation  that this project be terminated, and  all records concerning it expunged.  The soldiers will be debriefed, standard  confidentiality clause. Civilians will be  monitored, and we have the usual  measures prepared should they  try to go public. We don't think they will.
