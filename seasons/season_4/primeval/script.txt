ADAM: Your thoughts are troubled.  In turmoil. I understand,  brother. We have a lot to discuss.
ADAM: Speak.
RILEY: What have you done to me?
ADAM: Nothing. It was Mother -  your Professor Walsh.  She implanted the behavior modifier.
RILEY: (stunned) A chip in my head. She really did it.
ADAM: Actually, the chip is here.  Tied directly into your central  nervous system through the  thoracic nerve. This is phase  one of your preparation. It  lay dormant until the time  came. I simply activated it, brother.
RILEY: (snapping) Stop calling me that. I'm  <u>not</u> your brother. You're a  botched science experiment.  And I'm a human being who's  going to do everything in his power to-
ADAM: Sit.
ADAM: You have no power.
ADAM: Not yet. Once you forget your  old life and embrace your destiny  as I have, you'll know power  you've never dreamed of. (considers) I think you're going to like it.
ADAM: Demons cling to old ways  and ancient feuds. And they're hopeless with technology. Unworthy.
RILEY: Not really wanting a lecture right now.
ADAM: Disappointed by demonkind,  we turn to humans. Smart,  adaptive, but emotional and weak.  Blind. There is imperfection  everywhere. Something must  be done. Who will deliver us?
ADAM: Mother. She creates me -  demon strength, human will,  high-grade titanium. Evolution  through technology. I am the new  standard for all living beings and  our mother knew that. She saw  our future, yours and mine.
ADAM: She saw that you are necessary.  She saw the role you will play  by my side. Stand up.
ADAM: You see, we <u>are</u> brothers, after all.
ADAM: I didn't send for you, Spike.
SPIKE: Yeah, well, I'm not much the  "being sent for" type. I'm more  of a "I did my part, so get this  chip outta my head" kinda guy.
SPIKE: Slightly stiffer than usual. It's  subtle, but I like it. What's with him?
ADAM: I activated his chip.
SPIKE: So it's chips all 'round, is it?  Someone must've bought the party-pak.
ADAM: You get <u>yours</u> out when the  Slayer is where I want her.
SPIKE: She's separated from her friends.  They want nothing to do  with her. She's all alone.
ADAM: That's how I want her. <u>Where</u>  I want her is down in the Initiative. (to Riley) She will ensure that as many demons  die as humans. She will achieve  maximum carnage before she is  too weak to go on.
RILEY: No! No you can't -
ADAM: (calmly) Stop talking.
SPIKE: Right. The Initiative. But getting  her there, that's what the bleeding  disks are for, in'it? The little witch  gives her the info and - pop - Alice  heads back down the rabbit hole.
ADAM: The witch?
SPIKE: Willow. 'Bout so high, perky,  good with the math? Natural choice.
ADAM: Her friend.
SPIKE: Right.
ADAM: One of the friends from whom you  have so efficiently separated her.
SPIKE: Damn right I did. Should'a seen  'em. They won't be talking to  each other for a long, long -
SPIKE: Hang on. I think I might have  detected a small flaw -
ADAM: So, you failed.
SPIKE: Hey, you're s'posed to be so smart,  and you let <u>me</u> plan this thing? Okay,  let's not quibble about who failed who,  the important thing is making sure  the slayer is where we want -
ADAM: Go.
SPIKE: Gone.
SPIKE: So, we'll do the chip thing when I get back?
GILES: (agitated) Yes, yes… all right. Heard you the first time.
WILLOW: Hey.
GILES: Hello. Sorry about the robe…  getting a bit of a late start.
WILLOW: Right.
TARA: Hope you're feeling all right, Mr. Giles.
GILES: (covering manfully) Oh, quite well. Probably have  a bit of a brisk jog later…
GILES: (weakly) Did you want something?
WILLOW: I forgot my laptop and the disks. (off his blank look) The encrypted disks Spike stole  from the Initiative? I still need to  decode them.
GILES: Of course. Come in.
GILES: Were you planning on… working here? (wincing a little) Typing and… talking… because  that would be fine.
WILLOW: No, that's okay.
GILES: Can I offer you something?  Some breakfast?
TARA: We already had some… Lunch.
GILES: Yes, lunch. Which comes after breakfast.
TARA: (not unkindly) Usually.
WILLOW: Got 'em.
WILLOW: So… See you.
GILES: Right. Good luck with that.
WILLOW: Okay… Bye.
TARA: Bye.
ANYA: You said you wanted to check the  board at the unemployment office  this morning.
ANYA: You can't go this way. They won't  even interview you if you're naked.
XANDER: I'm not going. There's never anything good. (then) Maybe I <u>should</u> join the army.
ANYA: Don't they make you get up really  early in the morning?
XANDER: Oh yeah. Never mind.
ANYA: Are you still upset about the  fight you had with your friends?
ANYA: That was hours ago. Get over it.
XANDER: Anya - (stops himself) Forget it.
ANYA: So they all think you're a lost,  directionless loser with no plan  for his future. (dismissing it) Pfff.
XANDER: Anya, you can't pfff that stuff away.
ANYA: Why not?
XANDER: (with difficulty) I don't know, 'cause I think maybe they're right.
ANYA: So what if they are? You're a good  person and a good boyfriend and you  do amazing things with your tongue  and I'm in love with you.
ANYA: Whatever they think of you, it shouldn't matter.
XANDER: Yeah. Yeah it doesn't matter.
ADAM: This is where it will all happen.  Where the new race begins.
RILEY: Where are we?
ADAM: In the Initiative. There are areas  nobody knew about, beyond those  who needed to. Mother kept her  secrets well…
ADAM: (to Walsh) Didn't you? (to Riley) This is all as she planned it.  Except she thought she would be alive…
RILEY: Are you… is that what you're  going to do to me?
ADAM: They are just workers. You  know your destiny is greater.
RILEY: Forrest… No. Oh, God.
FORREST: God has nothing to do with it.
SPIKE: Easy, Sheriff. Watch where  you point that thing.
BUFFY: What are you doing here?
SPIKE: Looking for a little weekend  getaway place. Shove off.
BUFFY: Adam's been using these caves.  I found his lair.
SPIKE: What? Cripes, that's all I need -  running into that goon. I ducked  in here last night. Soldier boys  were out in force. Lots of activity.
BUFFY: (wheels turning) And Adam's cleared out of here.  Whatever he's planning, it's  about to go down.
SPIKE: Look at little Nancy Drew… What  about those disks I nabbed? They  oughta tell you something.
BUFFY: The disks? Oh, I - Willow has them.
SPIKE: Well, I'd get on that. Can't ignore  valuable information just 'cause you  two birds fell out, can you?
BUFFY: Right…
SPIKE: 'Course, you do what you want.  No worry of mine, now is it?
TARA: Maybe you should rest. Clear your head…
WILLOW: Can't. Not now. I think I'm onto  something. I've been assuming the  ciphertext was encrypted with an  asymmetric algorithm. Then it hit me:  a hexagonic key-pattern. It's - (off her look) I'm scaring you now, huh?
TARA: A little. In a good way. It's like  a different kind of magic.
TARA: Hey! Look - you did it…
WILLOW: I didn't. I haven't even  finished putting in the new code.
TARA: Well something's doing it.
WILLOW: It must be programmed to  self-decrypt at a certain point. (irked) That's so annoying. It's like  someone blurting out the  answer to a riddle just when you -
WILLOW: I mean - yippie! - we have the information.
TARA: I don't know if "yippie"'s the  right response either. Read that -
TARA: (into phone) Hello? Um, yeah, she's right - (reconsidering) I mean let me check. (to Willow) It's Buffy.
RILEY: Professor Walsh?
RILEY: Professor Walsh… It's  Riley Finn. Can you hear me?
FORREST: Artificially reanimated with basic  to moderate brain activity. Mommy  can hear you. But she's still a walking corpse.
RILEY: So are you.
FORREST: (shaking his head) Mm-mm. Got that wrong. I'm surging  with life. And strength? Adam made  me to be nearly as bad as he is…
FORREST: Really looking forward to trying  out your girl again.
RILEY: I'm sorry, Forrest.
FORREST: Don't be. This is the best thing that  ever happened to me. I'm free of all  my weaknesses - my doubts… (eyeing Riley) He's gonna fix you up too, soon as we  got some choice parts. Then you and  me'll be back on the same side,  moving toward a new future-
RILEY: (cutting him off) I'll never let that happen.
FORREST: You don't get it, Brother. You  don't have a choice. Your will  belongs to us now.
RILEY: <u>No</u>. That's not true -
FORREST: Then why don't you get up out of  that chair and walk out of here?
RILEY: You can't - you can't control my -
WALSH: (flat, unemotional) Riley.
WALSH: Be a good boy.
BUFFY: (to Xander) Where's Anya?
XANDER: Oddly, Anya opted not to join  us despite all the fun we had  at our last meeting.
WILLOW: And I don't think Tara felt welcome.
BUFFY: Why? Because of the things we said? (off Will's hurt nod) Will - who told you we were  talking behind your back. Specifically?
WILLOW: I - well -  (a little sheepish) Spike - specifically. But -
BUFFY: (to Xander) And who told you we thought  you'd be better off joining the army?
XANDER: (embarrassed) That's not… exactly what he said.
GILES: You know, Spike can be quite  convincing when he -- I'm very stupid.
BUFFY: He played us. He wanted us to  fight. To split us up.
BUFFY: That's where it all came from.  The stuff we said the other night.
GILES: Of course. Piffle. Let's move on.
XANDER: I'm moving.
WILLOW: Me too.
BUFFY: Good. Great.
WILLOW: So - why do you think Spike made  with the head games?
XANDER: He's all dressed up with no one to  bite? He's got to get his yaya's somehow.
BUFFY: I think it's more than that. I think it's Adam.
XANDER: (forced shock) Spike is working for Adam?! After all we've done for - (giving up) No good. I can't even act surprised.
BUFFY: I went to Adam's lair just now. Adam  was gone and Spike "just happened" to  be there. He made a big noise about  how I should check out the  information on those encrypted disks -
WILLOW: Oh! Hey - I decrypted them! (grumpy admission) Well. They decrypted themselves  but I almost had it.
XANDER: Decrypted themselves?  Kinda defeats the purpose, yah?
GILES: What did they say?
WILLOW: A bunch of stuff we already knew  about 314 - but it also said there's  some "final phase" where Adam  manufactures a bunch of creepy  cyber-demonoids just like him.  There's a special lab down in the  Initiative, but it didn't say where it was.
BUFFY: Adam fed Spike the disks. It has to be.  He wants me to know all about his evil  guy assembly line. (things clicking in her head) And this lab is <u>in</u> the Initiative?
WILLOW: (nods) Hidden somewhere.
BUFFY: (has got it) Give this demon his due. He thought this one out.
WILLOW: What do you mean?
BUFFY: You know how the Initiative has been  so overcrowded? Those demons were  too easy to catch. It's like they wanted  <u>in</u> that place -
GILES: The Trojan horse.
BUFFY: The demons are going to attack  the Initiative from inside.
XANDER: Demons versus soldiers… Massacre massacre…
WILLOW: …and Adam gets neat piles of parts to  start building his army. Diabolical yet gross.
XANDER: Does anybody else miss the Mayor?  "I just want to be a big snake."
BUFFY: I gotta shut him down, Giles. The  final phase is about to start.
GILES: We need to warn the Initiative -
BUFFY: They won't listen to me.
WILLOW: Riley?
BUFFY: He's a deserter. Anyway he… he got  some bad news, kinda took off.  Which is fine with me.
XANDER: (raises his hand) Okay, I'm confused again. Adam has this  evil plan, why's he so anxious for you to  know about it?
BUFFY: Oh, he wants me down there. Probably  figures I'll even out the kill ratio.
XANDER: He's not worried you might kill, oh, say, <u>him</u>?
BUFFY: (concerned) He's really not.
ADAM: She's coming. I can feel it.
SPIKE: Good on you. Got a chunk of  prognosticating demon in there, eh?
SPIKE: Now - if you'll just get this chip outta  my cranium, I'll be out of your way. (re: his hair) And mind the hairline. Don't fancy  fussing with a comb-over once I  resume my killing ways.
SPIKE: Come on now. We had a deal.
ADAM: When she's here.
GILES: We have no lack of supplies - I only  wish I knew which ones would kill Adam.
BUFFY: According to Riley, Adam's power source  comes from a uranium core embedded  somewhere inside his chest. Probably near the spine.
XANDER: Great. So we just ask him to lie down  quietly while we do some exploratory surgery.
WILLOW: What about magic? Some kind of…  I don't know, uranium extracting spell. (squinting) I know. I'm reaching.
GILES: Perhaps a paralyzing spell. But I'm  afraid I can't do the incantation for one of those -
WILLOW: Right. Don't you have to speak it in  Sumerian or something?
GILES: I do speak Sumerian. The difficulty is,  only an experienced witch can incant it  - and you have to be within striking  distance of the subject.
XANDER: (to Buffy) See what you get for taking Spanish  instead of Sumerian?
BUFFY: What was I thinking?
XANDER: So - no problem. All we need is  a combo Buffy with slayer strength,  Giles' multi-lingual know-how and  Willow's witchy power.
XANDER: Yeah, don't tell me, I'm just full of  helpful suggestions.
GILES: As a matter of fact, Xander, you are.
WILLOW: (to Xander) Nervous?
XANDER: No way. I'm full of that good old  Kamikaze spirit.
GILES: Xander. Just because this can never  work is no reason to be negative.
BUFFY: Game faces, guys. We're going in.
BUFFY: How you doing?
WILLOW: Super. What was I thinking,  using stairs all this time?
BUFFY: Okay. Good. (a beat/then) Will…
WILLOW: Really, Buffy, it's not as scary  as I thought.
BUFFY: No. I was going to say… I'm  sorry. I hate that things have been  so strained between all of us.
WILLOW: It's not your fault. Spike stirred up trouble.
BUFFY: But - I think trouble was stir  up-able. I think we've all sort  of drifted apart this year… (off her silence) Don't you?
WILLOW: (it's hard to admit) Maybe a little. But, you know, first  year of college. Hard to keep the  high school gang together.
BUFFY: But I <u>want</u> it together. I miss you,  and Xander - and Giles. (then) And it is my fault. I've been a bad friend. I got so caught up in my own stuff.
WILLOW: You're the slayer, Buffy. Your stuff is  pretty crucial.
BUFFY: I mean Riley. And - Riley, mostly.
WILLOW: I wasn't exactly Ms. Available either.  I kept secrets. I hid things from everyone.
BUFFY: That's not your fault. I mean, you were  going through something huge -
WILLOW: I wanted to tell you. But I was so scared…
BUFFY: You can tell me anything, Willow.  I love you. You're my best friend.
WILLOW: Me too. I love you too.
BUFFY: Let's promise to never not talk again -
WILLOW: I promise. I promise…
BUFFY: Xander!
WILLOW: Xander! Wonderful Xander!
BUFFY: Xander - you know we love you, right?
WILLOW: We do. Totally.
XANDER: Oh god. We're gonna die, aren't we?
WILLOW: No - we just missed you.
XANDER: (calling up) Giles, hurry up! You definitely want  to get down here for this.
BUFFY: (sotto) Okay. If we stick together, we'll  be fine. Everybody ready?
BUFFY: Good. Let's -
BUFFY: …do this.
SPIKE: Bait's been taken, trap's all set - the Slayer has landed. So. One chipperectomy, please
SPIKE: Hello? Paging Dr. Owe-Me-One...?
ADAM: She's not alone.
ADAM: You failed me again.
SPIKE: That's one way of looking at it.
ADAM: What's the other way?
SPIKE: Oh, come on! It's not like I wasn't trying! That's worth something, right?
ADAM: I suppose... Yes - I will honor our agreement and remove your chip. (to Forrest) Take his head off.
ADAM: Let him go.
ADAM: There's nowhere left to run.
BUFFY: Colonel -
NAMARA: Shut up. Got some nerve, lady.
BUFFY: You've got to listen -
NAMARA: You think you and your friends can  just keep waltzing into a government  installation, brandishing weapons like, like-
WILLOW: It's a gourd.
GILES: (somewhat sheepishly) <i>Magic</i> gourd.
NAMARA: What kind of freaks are you people?
BUFFY: Adam is here, Colonel. In the Initiative.
NAMARA: Nice try.
BUFFY: Those overcrowded containment  cells of yours? Compliments of  Adam. He's pulling a Trojan Horse  on you, Colonel. Waiting for his moment -
NAMARA: Every inch of this installation is under  constant, twenty-four hour surveillance.
WILLOW: Including the secret lab?
NAMARA: (brusquely) Including <u>everything</u>! (then) What secret lab?
BUFFY: The one Adam's using. The one built  for the final stage in the 314 project. (off his look) And you have no idea what I'm talking  about, do you?
NAMARA: I know everything that goes on around  here. A tick on a mouse couldn't get in  without my knowing it. And if Adam  wants to try, we're ready for him.
GILES: Exactly how do you plan to get close  enough to Adam to remove his power source?
NAMARA: Hit him simultaneously with multiple taser  blasters. Incapacitate him with as much  voltage as we can muster.
XANDER: Great plan. Right up there with "duck and cover".
BUFFY: I've seen Adam hit with a taser blast,  Colonel. He feeds on it. And now  you want to provide him with an  all-you-can-eat buffet.
NAMARA: You telling me my business?
BUFFY: This isn't your business. It's mine. You,  the Initiative, the boys at the Pentagon…  You're in way over heads. Messing with  primeval forces you've got no comprehension of.
NAMARA: And you do.
BUFFY: I'm the Slayer. You're playing on my turf.
NAMARA: Maybe up there. Down here I'm the one in control.
DIXON: (re: panel read-out) Sir, the power grid's down. Backup's not  responding. We're locked in.
ADAM: This will be interesting.
DIXON: Colonel. Containment Area's been  breached. Hostiles are loose.
NAMARA: How many?
DIXON: All of them, sir.
BUFFY: It's Adam.
BUFFY: I'm the only one who can stop him now  and you know it. Let me handle Adam.  You just get your people out of here.
DIXON: Sir. Awaiting orders. (beat) Sir?
NAMARA: You men… follow me. We have to take  the armory. Now!
BUFFY: Colonel -
NAMARA: (barks to guards) These people are under arrest. Do you understand?
BUFFY: We've got to find Adam.
WILLOW: On it.
GILES: Buffy, in order to perform the  enjoining ritual we're going to  need a place that's close to you and quiet.
XANDER: Uh, checking the monitors, I'd say world  war three just broke out. A quiet little  corner won't be easy.
BUFFY: First things first…
NAMARA: Fall back! Fall back! Protect  the flank gunners and lock  down that pit!
XANDER: Anybody else getting that warm,  sitting duck feeling?
BUFFY: How we doing, Will?
WILLOW: (re: monitor) Hold on, hold on, look at this.  According to this, there's air  ducts and electrical conduits all running into… (points) … there.
BUFFY: So?
WILLOW: So, there's no there there. Look.
BUFFY: It's Adam.
GILES: Are you sure?
BUFFY: Right behind room 314.
XANDER: What?! Are you telling me  a top secret government operation  has rooms they're not telling us  about? If we survive, I'm writing  my Congressman.
BUFFY: (to Willow) Can you unlock it?
WILLOW: I don't have to. Every lock in the  Initiative's been disengaged. (looking up) Except the exits.
XANDER: Demon open house.
BUFFY: Great. So we know we're going to 314. Now all we have to do is get there.
BUFFY: Come on!
BUFFY: It's here.
WILLOW: How do we open it?
BUFFY: Once I'm in - barricade it. Giles -  this place okay to be Magic Central?
GILES: It … should do.
WILLOW: Long as we don't get all blowed up or nothin'.
XANDER: And what are the odds of that?
BUFFY: How long before the ritual kicks in?
GILES: Five minutes, give or take.
BUFFY: I'll move fast, then.
XANDER: Buffy, I still don't like you going in alone.
BUFFY: I won't be.
BUFFY: Riley?
BUFFY: Are you hurt? Say something.
BUFFY: Riley? What is this? Why  won't you talk to me?
BUFFY: Me?
ADAM: You should be fighting the  demons. Evening the kill ratio.
BUFFY: Sorry - Maybe it's the slayer in me,  but I don't jump through hoops on  command. I've never been one to tow the line.
ADAM: Oh. (to Forrest/simply) Kill her.
FORREST: I thought you'd never ask.
WILLOW: (reading) By the generous will of the  Ancients, the almighty power  of the Divine Spirits… Your  supplicants humbly beseech thee  to behold us, and that which we  possess… the moieties of the  One, the Avatar…
RILEY: B-Buffy!
FORREST: Shut up and watch me kill your  girlfriend, Finn. That's an order.
WILLOW: Spiritus… The Spirit…
XANDER: Animus… Heart…
GILES: Sophus… Mind…
WILLOW: And Manus. The Hand.
WILLOW: We enjoin that we may inhabit  the vessel - the hand -  daughter of Sineya, First of the Ones.
FORREST: (to Buffy) That it? That all you got?
RILEY: She's got me.
FORREST: Look who's come off the bench.
BUFFY: (to Riley) I need to get to Adam. Like now. Are you able --?
RILEY: Go.
ADAM: Mother always knew you were  going to prove to be a threat to her work.
BUFFY: Yeah, well, Professor Walsh  was no dummy. A little light  on the sanity, yeah -
BUFFY: Broke your arm.
ADAM: Got another.
ADAM: I've been upgrading.
WILLOW: We implore thee: Admit us,  bring us to the vessel! Take us <u>now</u>!
ADAM: You can't last much longer.
BUFFY: We can. We are forever.
BUFFY: (Sumerian) sha me-en-dan. Gesh-toog  me-en-dan. Zee me-en-den.  Oo-khush-ta me-ool-lee-a  ba-ab-tum-mu-do-en.
BUFFY: (English translation) We are heart. We are mind.  We are spirit. From the raging  storm, we bring the power of  the Primeval One.
ADAM: Interesting.
BUFFY: (Sumerian) Im-a sheng-ab.
BUFFY: (English translation) Boil the air.
ADAM: Very … interesting.
FORREST: What are you making me do this for?
FORREST: Not that I'm not enjoying myself.  But Adam's not gonna like it if I -
BUFFY: (Sumerian) Kur.
BUFFY: (English translation) Change.
ADAM: How… can you…?
BUFFY: You could never hope to  grasp the source of our power.
BUFFY: But yours is right here.
RILEY: Buffy?
WILLOW: Wow… That -- that was…
SPIKE: (catching his breath) Whew. Nasty sort of fellow.  Lucky for you blighters I was here, eh?
GILES: Well, yes. Thank you. But  your heroism is slightly muted  by the fact that you were helping  Adam start a war that would <u>kill us all</u>.
XANDER: You probably just saved us so  we wouldn't stake you right here!
SPIKE: Well, yeah. (then) Did it work?
SPIKE: Well then everything is all right  and we all get to be not staked  through the heart. Good work, team.
GILES: Buffy!
WILLOW: Wasn't it amazing?
XANDER: You were great.
BUFFY: We were great.
RILEY: We still got men out there.
SPIKE: Well let's go save them, by gum!
BUFFY: You guys get to the exits, get  'em open somehow. Riley, try  and organize the soldiers, pull  'em back. I'll take point.
WILLOW: You up to this?
BUFFY: I seriously am.
WARD: This was an experiment. The  Initiative represented the government's  interest in not only controlling the  Otherworldly Menace, but in  harnessing its power for our  own military purposes. It is  the considered opinion of this  council that the experiment has failed.
WARD: It is therefore our recommendation  that this project be terminated, and  all records concerning it expunged.  The soldiers will be debriefed, standard  confidentiality clause. Civilians will be  monitored, and we have the usual  measures prepared should they  try to go public. We don't think they will.
