WARD: And the men?
NAMARA: These are exceptional boys. Their capture ratio just keeps increasing, they're keeping it together. Morale's a problem… The death of Professor Walsh, the escape of the prototype… Controlling the HST's is getting harder -- we have serious overcrowding in the containment areas.
WARD: Quite a mess.
NAMARA: Not my mess, sir. I'm just holding the fort 'til you figure out what you wanna do with the place.
WARD: Well, that's the purpose of these evaluations. And we appreciate your good work in this crisis period. (a dig) The incident with Finn was unfortunate…
NAMARA: Fell in with the bad crowd. Quite frankly, I don't think he was ever the soldier you all hoped he was. Boy thinks too much.
WARD: Never the less, we want him back. The government has invested a substantial --
NAMARA: We'll catch up with him. My feeling is that he won't stray too far from the girl.
WARD: Yes, Buffy Summers. Our databanks don't have very much on her.
NAMARA: She's just a girl.
WARD: This would the 'girl' who broke into the complex, liberated Finn and an HST, and walked you out of the place at gunpoint? (checks his file) Oh no. I'm wrong. Crossbow-point.
NAMARA: You want me to bring her in, I'd be --
WARD: No. Any action against her would send Finn over the edge. We're still hoping he'll come --
NAMARA: He's a deserter.
WARD: He's a resource. And I doubt very much he's going to present a real danger to the Initiative just because he's gone swoony for some young radical. She is, as you say, just a girl.
SPIKE: She's a lot more than that. The Slayer's dangerous, is all I'm saying.
ADAM: Yes, she makes things interesting.
SPIKE: No, see, you're not getting it, Mr. Bits. You're gonna be interestingly dead. Little Miss Tiny's got a habit of bolixing up the plans of every would-be unstoppable badass who steps foot in this town.
ADAM: Then we must ascertain the nature of this variable.
SPIKE: Yeah, well, I was told there wouldn't be any math. (then) Just wanted you to know, when the Big Ugly goes down, Slayer's gonna be right in the thick of it. You ready for that?
ADAM: I'm counting on it.
ADAM: Two slayers…
SPIKE: That's right.
ADAM: And you killed them both…
SPIKE: Yeah. Well, not at the same time, but, yeah, I killed the hell out of 'em.
ADAM: Yet you fear this one.
SPIKE: (bristling) Watch it, mate. I don't fear anything. I just know my enemies.
ADAM: Do you? Then why haven't you killed this slayer yet?
SPIKE: Because… (searching) Stinking rotten luck is why. (then) On top of that now I got this buggering chip in my head.
ADAM: Yes. Your behavior modification circuitry. I know what you feel…
SPIKE: (scoffing) Not likely.
ADAM: You feel smothered. Trapped like an animal, pure in its ferocity, unable to actualize the urges within… Clinging to one truth like a flame struggling to burn within an enclosed glass… That a beast this powerful cannot be contained. Inevitably it will break free and savage the land again… I will make you whole again. Make you savage.
SPIKE: Wow. I mean, yeah. I get why the demons all fall in line with you. You're like Tony Robbins is he was a big, scary Frankenstein-looking… You're exactly like Tony Robbins.
ADAM: I will restore you to what you once were…
ADAM: When I have the Slayer how and where I want her.
SPIKE: (sigh) Easier said. She's crafty. She and her little friends.
ADAM: Friends…
SPIKE: Yeah. There's your… whatcha call it - variable. This slayer's got pals. You want her evening the odds in a scrape, you don't want her slayerettes mucking about.
ADAM: Take them away from her.
SPIKE: Yeah, that's a plan. She's working solo, she won't have a chance to come after us when the wild rumpus begins. Plus it'll make her miserable, and I never get tired of that.
SPIKE: Oh yeah. Leave them to me.
ADAM: You can't hurt them. What can you do to make sure they're out of the picture?
SPIKE: Not a blessed thing. They're gonna do it for me.
XANDER: L.A. woman? (shakes his head) Haven't heard from her. She'll probably come here first thing, though. And… who's your buddy?
XANDER: So you don't have to be G.I. Joe while your civvies are gettin' washed…
XANDER: Try those on, you'll feel like a new man.
RILEY: Would this man have a bright red nose and big floppy feet?
RILEY: Sorry, that's the cabin fever talking. I'm grateful. Really.
XANDER: Okay. So, how you holding up otherwise?
RILEY: I've been trained to survive harsher conditions. All I really need's a sharpened stick, half a canteen of water and… (sighs) … Room service and Spectravision. Don't love doing the survival bit.
XANDER: But, as post-Apocalypse splendor goes…
RILEY: I've done wonders with the place. Still. The sooner Buffy's back, the better I'll feel.
XANDER: You and me both, big guy.
RILEY: I take it you're not an Angel fan, either.
XANDER: It's not like I hate the guy. Just, you know, the guts part of him.
RILEY: Can't blame you. But, to be fair: It's not him you hate, it's the curse.
RILEY: Right?
XANDER: What did Buffy tell you?
RILEY: About Angel? Everything. More than I wanted to know, sometimes. She loved him. He turned evil. He killed people. She cured him. He left.
XANDER: "And they all lived happily ever after." Did she happen to mention what turned him evil?
RILEY: He was cursed. Some kind of gypsy thing. And then… I dunno. Hundred years passed or the moon hit a certain phase or…
XANDER: One moment's happiness.
RILEY: What about it?
XANDER: It's his trigger. Angel's an okay guy - so long as he's mopey and sad and brooding. But give him even one second of pure, real pleasure…
RILEY: And that sets him off.
XANDER: Only in a big old kill-your- friends kind of way. And you know what makes Angel happiest? Give you a hint: it's not crème brulee.
RILEY: Buffy.
RILEY: Sex. With Buffy.
XANDER: Hate to be the one to tell ya.
RILEY: (numb) Yeah, me too. (beat) Well, that explains a lot of things I wish weren't explained.
XANDER: Hey, but that's ancient history, buddy.
RILEY: And she went running to L.A. to bone up on her history.
XANDER: No, I'm sure it's boneless. She just needs to make sure that everything's okay. She's probably back already.
RILEY: Maybe.
XANDER: You'll feel better when you see her.
RILEY: Guess we'll see.
GILES: (singing) …if I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me… For I must be travellin' on now, 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see… but if I stayed here with you girl, thing's just wouldn't be the same… 'cause I'm as free as a bird na-a- aaAAHHH!!!
SPIKE: I think it was my childlike conviction that you couldn't get more pathetic that makes this so depressing.
GILES: (grimacing) Please, come in.
SPIKE: You know, for someone who's got "Watcher" on his resume, you might want to cast an eye to the front door every now and again. Never know who'll barge in.
GILES: What do you want?
SPIKE: Ah. Knew I left one. Buffy around?
GILES: Why?
SPIKE: Need to speak with the lady of the house. Be a pet and give her a message for me, would you? Tell her I just might have something she just might want.
GILES: And what would this something be?
SPIKE: Information - highly classified. Not cheap word-on-the street prattle, either. I'm talking about the good stuff now.
GILES: Thrill me.
SPIKE: It's nothing I know. What, you think I'd come running over, saying "I've got a secret, beat me 'til I talk?" (shakes his head) There's files. In the Initiative, I'm pretty sure I know where.
GILES: Files.
SPIKE: Yeah. Secrets. Mission statements, design schematics… All of Maggie Walsh's dirty laundry, which I guess would include lots of tidbits about --
GILES: Adam.
SPIKE: Well, yeah. Say someone was to risk his life and limb -- well, limb, anyway -- to obtain said files, might be worth a little something…
GILES: At this point, a cynical person would think you were offering just what we need when we need it most.
SPIKE: That person'd be right, Rupert. Supply and demand. You've got a beastie to kill, I need the dosh. And it won't be cheap this time.
GILES: What do you want?
SPIKE: Year's supply of blood, guaranteed protection, merry bushels of cash and - most important - a guarantee that I'm not to be in any way slain.
GILES: Done.
SPIKE: With a smile and a nod from you? Sorry - not close to good enough. This deal's with the Slayer.
GILES: I'll tell her.
SPIKE: Oh, you'll tell her. Great comfort, that. What makes you think she'll listen to you?
GILES: Because.
SPIKE: Very convincing.
GILES: I am her Watcher.
SPIKE: Think you're neglecting the past tense there, Rupert. Besides, she barely listened when you were in charge. I've seen the way she treats you.
GILES: Yes? A-and how's that?
SPIKE: Very much like a retired librarian. Look. I've got what she wants - long as she has what I want. Pass the word. She knows where to find me.
GILES: I'll think about it.
WILLOW: I keep thinking, okay, that's the cutest thing ever, and then she does something cuter and completely resets the whole scale.
TARA: Did you see her yawn earlier?
WILLOW: Yes! I thought I was going to die. (to kitten) I love you, Miss Kitty Fantastico.
TARA: We've got to get her a real name.
WILLOW: It's so cool she's all ours-- yours. That she's yours is cool.
TARA: She can be ours if you want.
TARA: You still need an elective. How about sophomore level psych?
WILLOW: Oh. Kind of psyched-out after Professor Walsh. Maybe something fun like drama. I could be dramatic. (to kitten) You cannot have more catnip! You <u>have a catnip problem</u>.
TARA: Definitely drama.
WILLOW: I haven't even dealt with the housing forms yet. Have you done anything? I hear there's some off- campus places that are way cool for, you know, a group to go in on.
TARA: Oh. I figured you'd be dorming it up with Buffy again.
WILLOW: We haven't really talked about it. I used to just assume we'd be roomies through grad school and into little old ladyhood -- you know, cheating at Bingo together and forgetting to take our pills.
TARA: But…
WILLOW: (shrugs) But, I don't know. It hardly feels like we're roommates now. She's all busy with Riley, and I'm gone a lot too. And when we are there together, it's just Slayer business talk and feeding Amy the rat. I guess I should ask her…
BUFFY: Riley. Hi.
RILEY: Hi. I got a little tired of sitting around waiting, so…
BUFFY: … You joined the circus?
RILEY: (entering) Xander took my clothes to clean 'em. Left me these. Does he hate me in some way I don't know about yet? I think I would've attracted less attention in my uniform.
BUFFY: Is it okay for you to be here?
RILEY: You tell me.
BUFFY: I mean, with a whole government branch hunting you down and all.
RILEY: I'm good.
RILEY: Took me awhile, but I patched into their frequency. Can't sneak up on a guy if he's listening in.
BUFFY: You're the trickiest.
RILEY: Why they hired me.
RILEY: Are you okay?
BUFFY: Yeah. I'm fine, it's just … Angel kind of upset me.
RILEY: How?
BUFFY: It's not that interesting.
RILEY: Got my attention.
BUFFY: He spun my head a little. I assure you: not of the big.
RILEY: You don't want to talk about it.
BUFFY: Deconstructing Angel really can wait. I want to get out there and patrol. Find Adam. Talk about it later?
RILEY: It's the pants, isn't it? It's okay. I couldn't take me seriously in these things either.
BUFFY: Riley, it's not that big of a deal.
RILEY: Tell you what, why don't I get out of your face. You had a long trip.
BUFFY: You don't have to go.
RILEY: It's okay. Besides… (re: pants) I gotta re-charge them every two hours or they go dead on me.
BUFFY: Okay, then… see ya.
XANDER: Here. You shoulda just kept the ensemble from the last time sneaking into the Initiative. I'm not a clothing delivery service.
ANYA: (to Spike) Well he is, kind of. He did Riley yesterday.
SPIKE: Oh, hello. This is just… swell.
SPIKE: Gotta say, liking this quite a lot. Kind of changes the balance of pow-ARRR!
SPIKE: Come on, you've got to be kidding!
ANYA: Wow. The chip in your head means you can't even point a gun. How humiliating.
XANDER: Gun doesn't work anyway. It's a fake.
ANYA: Can't even point a <u>decorative</u> gun.
XANDER: Give it up for American chipmanship.
SPIKE: It doesn't work? What about self defense? I'm taking a risk here, you know. These Initiative prats aren't keen on letting a fellow pop in and have a bit of a rummage- around. Not twice, anyway.
XANDER: Can I tell you how much I really don't care?
SIPKE: Attitude. We'll see how far <u>that</u> takes you at boot camp. Hey, s'pose you'll get a tough-as-nails drill sergeant who's only hard on the men 'cause he's trying to keep 'em alive when the bullets start flying? I love that stuff.
XANDER: Boot camp? Yeah, like I'd go there.
SPIKE: Oh, you changed your mind? Not gonna join?
ANYA: You're joining the army?!
XANDER: (to Anya) Okay, one: ow. Two. (to Spike) Where'd you get that idea? And three: (to Anya) Ow! I am not joining the army.
ANYA: Well, good. Stopped that nonsense just in time.
XANDER: I was never-- (to Spike) Who told you this?
SPIKE: Your little girlie-mates were talking… something about being "all you can be" or "all <u>you</u> can be." Having a laugh… I figured you were signing up. Say, you got anything larger in the toy gun line?
XANDER: All I can… can you believe that? Like I'm some useless lunk. It happens that I'm good at lots of things! I help with all kinds of… stuff… I have… skills, and strategems, I'm very… (to Anya) Help me out.
ANYA: (helpful, to Spike) He's a viking in the sack.
SPIKE: (barely listening) T'rific. (examining clothes) You didn't have these cleaned after the last time, did you?
XANDER: (to Anya) This is <u>so</u> like them lately. It's all about them and the college life. You know what college is? It's high school without the actual <u>going to class</u>. Well, high school was sort of like that too but the point is, I'm the one working hard to earn a living and it's a huge joke to them. (mocking) "Xander got fired from Starbucks." "Xander got fired from the phone sex place…"
ANYA: They look down on you.
XANDER: (agreeing) And they <u>hate</u> you…
ANYA: But they don't look down on me.
SPIKE: It was just a laugh. Don't have to go insane over it.
XANDER: Is anybody talking to you?
SPIKE: Sir, no, Sir.
FORREST: Don't shoot.
BUFFY: Give me a reason not to.
FORREST: You killing humans, now?
BUFFY: Not yet. Beating you senseless should do just fine.
FORREST: I could have a patrol here in under a minute - So here's a plan: you go your way, and I'll go mine.
BUFFY: I'm checking out that cave.
FORREST: My orders exactly.
BUFFY: Alone?
FORREST: We're spread a little thin right now, so yeah. Family's tearing apart-
BUFFY: Family? Last time I dropped by you put a gun to my head. What kind of family are you guys? The Corleones?
FORREST: Weren't until you showed up.
BUFFY: What, no girls in the club?
FORREST: You think you're the first girlfriend Riley's ever had? There's one big head on that skinny little body -- no, you're just the first one ever got him to commit <u>treason</u>. Riley had a career. He had a future 'til he met you and yeah, I got a problem with that.
BUFFY: A future? A future doing what? Illegal experiments? Torture? Murder? I guess killing someone isn't a problem for you.
FORREST: Less and less. Now why don't you get the hell out of here before I --
BUFFY: Touch me again you'll find out what Slayer-strength is like.
FORREST: Think it's about time you showed me, then.
ADAM: Yes.
ADAM: I think that would be interesting.
BUFFY: Get out of here.
FORREST: Not moving.
BUFFY: (to Forrest) GO!
ADAM: Thank you.
SPIKE: Think I lost the buggers.
WILLOW: Any luck with the disk?
SPIKE: Took what they had. Should be something useful on one of 'em.
WILLOW: Hope so…
TARA: What are we looking for?
WILLOW: Anything about Adam.
GILES: (to Spike) No problems getting in and out?
SPIKE: No. I mean, a couple of 'em made me on the way out, but I took care of them.
GILES: Gave them a good running-away- from, did you?
SPIKE: Well, yeah. When do I get paid?
GILES: When Willow tells me you've brought us something useful.
SPIKE: I coulda gone straight to the slayer, you know. I cut you in, let you pretend you're actually in charge. Now you gotta wait for Red's permission to finish the deal?
GILES: As soon as we see what's on the discs --
TARA: It looks like gibberish.
SPIKE: (moving to them) Gibberish?
TARA: Or possibly gobbledygook. It's not words, anyway…
WILLOW: They're encrypted.
GILES: Wonderful.
SPIKE: Well, why did… can you fix them?
WILLOW: Crack a government encryption code on my laptop? Easy as really difficult pie.
SPIKE: You're not exactly the whiz these days either. God, I'm never getting paid.
WILLOW: I am a whiz!
TARA: She is a whiz.
WILLOW: (grumbly) If ever a whiz there was… I just need some time.
SPIKE: No, I just heard you weren't… your mates said you weren't playing with computers so much. Into the new thing.
WILLOW: What new thing?
SPIKE: You know: you two, the whole… wicca thing.
WILLOW: They were talking about that?
SPIKE: Can we get back to business here? I got a deal at stake.
WILLOW: What'd they say?
SPIKE: Talking about, you know, it's a phase, you'll get over it.
WILLOW: What? Who said that?
TARA: Maybe we should focus on the gobbledygook…
WILLOW: Was it Buffy? (to Tara) 'Cause you know what she means by that…
SPIKE: She was defending you. 'Cause Xander said you were just being trendy.
WILLOW: Trendy?
SPIKE: I didn't see why they were going on. Person wants to be a witch, that's their business.
WILLOW: I knew Buffy was freaked.
TARA: You should talk to her, 'cause I'm sure…
SPIKE: Pressing business, ladies. Let's not get sidetracked. Still got your monsters to fight.
LIEUTENANT: Cell capacity's maxed out three days ago, sir. We keep up this pace, there'll be nowhere left to contain the Hostiles.
NAMARA: They're animals, Lieutenant. We'll pack them in until we're out of room - then pack them in some more.
LIEUTENANT: They're going to start tearing each other apart, Sir.
NAMARA: I have no problem with that scenario.
ANGEL: Riley Finn.
RILEY: I know you?
ANGEL: We have a friend in common.
RILEY: (realizes) Angel.
ANGEL: The welcoming committee your idea?
RILEY: Way I heard it, you were all peaceable now. You didn't by any chance go and lose that pesky soul again, did you?
ANGEL: Don't push me, boy.
RILEY: (contained rage) Now what could possibly have happened with Buffy that would make you lose your soul?
ANGEL: (can't resist) That'd be between me and her.
RILEY: Where do you think you're going?
ANGEL: See an old girlfriend.
RILEY: You think I'm gonna let that happen?
ANGEL: You think you're gonna stop me?
RILEY: I surely do.
BUFFY: Xander, it's Buffy.
BUFFY: Xander?
BUFFY: Xander, call me. I think we need to get the gang together.
BUFFY: Hi, uh, Tara? It's Buffy. I'm looking for Willow. If you see her, would you tell her? I - it's pretty important. Thanks.
BUFFY: Giles. It's me. Just … call me.
BUFFY: Angel…
ANGEL: Hey. Can I come in?
BUFFY: I guess.
ANGEL: Need a little more than that, Buffy.
BUFFY: Oh. Come in.
BUFFY: You hurt?
ANGEL: I'll live.
BUFFY: Want to tell me who ran you into that doorknob?
ANGEL: Not really. It's not world in peril stuff.
BUFFY: Let me guess. You thought of something else really hurtful to say and it was just too good to do it over the phone. 'Cause the funniest part is the look on my face --
ANGEL: Buffy, please. I don't have a lot of time.
BUFFY: Why not? What's going --
RILEY: I told you you weren't coming near her.
RILEY: I meant it.
BUFFY: You've <u>got</u> to be kidding me. (glares at Angel) <u>This</u> is why you came?
ANGEL: No. It was an accident-
BUFFY: Running your car into a tree is an accident. Running your fist into somebody's face is a plan. You wanna explain this to me?
ANGEL: (to Riley) Put that gun down.
RILEY: It's pretty much all I got left, so I'm thinking not. He attacked four of my men, Buffy. He's up to his old tricks.
BUFFY: Oh… Riley - he's not. He isn't bad now. He won't hurt anybody. Angel, tell him…
ANGEL: (to Riley) Might hurt you.
RILEY: Please try.
ANGEL: Some threat. You can barely stand.
RILEY: Trigger finger feels okay.
ANGEL: (to Buffy) You actually sleep with this guy?
BUFFY: Stop it!
RILEY: Ow!
ANGEL: Ow!
BUFFY: That's enough! I see any more displays of testosterone poisoning, I will personally put you both in the hospital. Anybody think I'm exaggerating?
ANGEL: He started it --
BUFFY: (points - don't you dare) NNH!
BUFFY: Riley…
RILEY: I'm sorry, I just wanted to know you were safe.
BUFFY: I need to talk to Angel for a minute.
RILEY: What?
BUFFY: Riley, please.
RILEY: I'm not leaving this room. I mean it.
BUFFY: Okay.
RILEY: Not moving a muscle…
BUFFY: Okay. I come to see you, to <u>help</u> you and you treat me like I'm just… your ex-
ANGEL: Well, technically --
BUFFY: <u>Shut up</u>. (he clams up) Then you order me out of <u>your</u> city - and then you come here and start pounding on my boyfriend?! What is this? I'd really like to know: What the <u>hell</u> are you trying to do?
ANGEL: I was trying to make things better.
ANGEL: It's going pretty well, don't you think?
BUFFY: Swell. Although you might want to think about fire. Burning things - always effective.
ANGEL: I couldn't leave it like that. The way I spoke to you… I came to apologize. I had no right.
BUFFY: I… and Riley?
ANGEL: I got jumped by some soldiers. He came in in the middle. Wasn't real forthcoming with the benefit of the doubt.
BUFFY: Put yourself in his place.
ANGEL: I get it.
BUFFY: Look, I… you weren't entirely wrong, what you said in L.A. We don't live in each other's worlds anymore. I can't just barge in on yours and make judgments.
ANGEL: I'm still sorry.
BUFFY: Thank you.
ANGEL: And next time I'll apologize by phone.
ANGEL: Things seem pretty tense around here.
BUFFY: They really are.
ANGEL: Anything I can do?
BUFFY: Honestly, I think the best thing right now --
ANGEL: Okay.
BUFFY: It means a lot that you came.
ANGEL: Oh. And… Riley?
BUFFY: Yeah.
ANGEL: (nods) I don't like him.
BUFFY: Thanks.
SPIKE: That was fun. And I'm no stranger to a good night out. De-flowered a virgin Princess once. Killed a Minister mid-sermon. Even saw the Sex Pistols back in '76. But this …
SPIKE: … this was really special.
ADAM: You were successful.
SPIKE: Easier than I thought it'd be, too.
ADAM: You're sure?
SPIKE: Feel it in my bones. It's … call it the Yoko factor. (off Adam's blank stare) Don't tell me you never heard of The Beatles?
ADAM: I have. I like Helter Skelter.
SPIKE: What a surprise. Point is, they were once a real, powerful group. Not a stretch to say they ruled the world. And when they broke up, everyone blamed Yoko. But the fact is, the group split itself apart. She just happened to be there. And you know how it is with kids -- they go to college, they grow apart. Way of the world.
ADAM: So you've separated the Slayer from her friends.
SPIKE: Do I have to explain about Yoko again?
ADAM: I get it. I'm pleased.
SPIKE: So, since we've got all our ducks in a row… and not talking to each other, guess it's time for the grand plan. You know, the one where I get the chipectomy. You got everything you need, right?
ADAM: No.
ADAM: There's one more thing.
BUFFY: How bad are you hurt?
RILEY: Not sure yet. The night's still young.
BUFFY: I have something to tell you.
RILEY: Figured.
BUFFY: Maybe you should sit down.
RILEY: I'm fine.
BUFFY: Riley…
RILEY: Wait. Me, first. Buffy… I feel like we've gotten really close. At least, I thought we had. I don't know much about Angel, or your relationship with him. But all I ask is, if you're gonna break my heart? Do it fast.
BUFFY: What? You think… that Angel and I…
RILEY: Didn't you?
BUFFY: Of course not. I'd never do that to you.
RILEY: So - nothing?
BUFFY: Nothing. Riley. How can you even ask that?
RILEY: I don't know. Xander said-
BUFFY: (fuming) Xander. He is the deadest man in Deadonia-
RILEY: (cutting her off) No. It wasn't his fault. I prodded, and he explained <u>how</u> Angel went bad. The trigger-
BUFFY: Oh.
RILEY: (rambling) And, after that, I went a little nuts, you know? I mean, on the one hand, I should believe in us. But, on the other, sometimes things just happen between ex's and then I saw he was bad-
BUFFY: He wasn't bad.
RILEY: Seriously? That's a "good" day? (off her nod) Well there you go. Even when he's good he's all Mr. Billowy Coat King of Pain and girls really-
BUFFY: Riley. Stop.
RILEY: See? Nuts.
BUFFY: Have I ever given you reason to feel you couldn't trust me?
RILEY: No.
BUFFY: Then why with the crazy?
RILEY: Because I'm so in love with you I can't think straight.
BUFFY: Tell me about it.
BUFFY: Ry…
BUFFY: I still have to tell you something. And - there's no way to…
RILEY: Just say it.
BUFFY: Forrest is dead.
BUFFY: I'm so sorry… There was a fight. Adam killed him. I barely got away.
BUFFY: I know nothing I say can make things better. But I swear to you, we will find and destroy this thing. Right now you need time. Take what you need, I can…
RILEY: I have to go.
BUFFY: Are you sure? You…
RILEY: Have to go now.
BUFFY: It's all weird and jumbley.
WILLOW: It's still encrypted.
TARA: Willow's been working really hard on it, though.
BUFFY: Okay. So how long before you… uncrypt it?
WILLOW: Hours. Days, maybe. Anyone suggesting months would not be accused of crazy talk.
GILES: (too loud) Whatever happened to Latin? At least when that made no sense, the church approved.
BUFFY: (to Will re: disk) I can't just wait around, Will. That disk is no good to me unless you crack it soon-
ANYA: Hey! We worked hard getting that! Xander delivered clothing.
GILES: "The church approved."
BUFFY: Sorry everyone, but we're on a clock here. Adam was at that cave. Maybe he was there for a reason. I can go back, scope it out, track him if I have to…
WILLOW: (false enthusiasm) Right! And maybe you'll get lucky and he'll still be there and he can rip your arms off for you! Buffy, you can't go back alone.
GILES: (cheerful smile) You never train with me anymore. Adam's gonna kick your ass.
BUFFY: Giles?!
GILES: Sorry! Didn't mean to be so honest. Terribly sorry.
XANDER: So she doesn't go alone. Giles, weapons all around--
BUFFY: You're not coming, Xander. You'd get hurt. It'll be easier for me if I'm not worrying about protecting you.
XANDER: Oh. Okay. You and Willow go do the superpower thing. I'll stay behind and putter around the batcave (indicates Giles) with crusty old Alfred here.
GILES: Ahh. I am no Alfred, sir. You forget - Alfred had a <u>job</u>.
BUFFY: Willow stays behind too. I'll do it alone.
WILLOW: Great. And then, when you've got your new no arms, we'll all say, gee, it's a good thing we weren't there getting in the way of that!
XANDER: Right, and maybe we can help in other ways. Need some fightin' pants, Buff? I could go get you some fightin' pants.
BUFFY: Guys, you're just making this harder.
WILLOW: Wow. We're already getting in the way. We're good at this, huh, Xander?
XANDER: Right. I'm so good at it you might have to ship me off to the army to get me out of the way.
BUFFY: The army?
XANDER: You didn't know I knew about that, did you? You two talking about me behind my back.
BUFFY: <u>Us</u> talking about <u>you</u>? How about you telling Riley every last detail of my life with Angel--
WILLOW: (to Buffy) Besides - when is there any "us two?" (to Xander/Buffy) You two are the two who are the two. I'm the other one.
XANDER: Uh-huh. But maybe that all changes when I'm doing sit-ups at Fort Dix.
GILES: (thinks it's a dirty joke) Fort Dix. Heh heh…
BUFFY: (to Giles) Are you <u>drunk</u>?
GILES: (happily) Quite a bit, actually!
BUFFY: Well, stop it. (to Willow and Xander) This is stupid.
XANDER: Stupid. So you finally have the guts to say it to my face…
BUFFY: I don't think you're stupid, Xander, so stop being an idiot and help me fix things. I need both of you. I need you all the time, just not now. Adam is dangerous--
WILLOW: Wait. How do you need me? Really.
BUFFY: I need you a lot. You're great, with, with the computer. Usually.
GILES: Right you are. And I'm great with the pacing and the saying of "hmmmmm" and "ahhhhh," and "Good Lord!"
BUFFY: (ignoring him) And you got the witch-stuff… that's…
WILLOW: (exploding) <u>Witch stuff</u>?! What do you mean by witch stuff?!
BUFFY: What is happening? This is crazy.
GILES: No it's not! It's all finally making perfect sense and I'm not going to miss a moment of it.
TARA: You think this'll go on awhile?
ANYA: Hard to say.
TARA: Nice bathroom.
ANYA: Like the tile.
XANDER: And if I did join the army I'd be great. You know why? Because maybe they'd give me a job that couldn't be done by any well- trained Border Collie.
GILES: That's it. I'm going to bed!
WILLOW: Sure, you'd be wonderful in the army -- you think the umbilical cord between you and Anya would stretch that far?
XANDER: I knew it. I <u>knew</u> you hated her.
WILLOW: Hey, I'm not the one being judgmental, here. I'll leave that territory to you and Buffy.
BUFFY: Judgmental? If I was any more open minded about the choices you two make my whole brain would fall out.
XANDER: Oh. And superior. Don't forget that. Just because you're better than us doesn't mean you can be all superior.
BUFFY: Guys, stop this. What happened to you today?
WILLOW: It's not today. Buffy, everything's been wrong for a while. Don't you see that?
BUFFY: Willow, what do you mean things have been wrong? Things don't have to be wrong, do they?
WILLOW: Buffy, things haven't been right since Tara. We have to face it. You can't handle Tara being my girlfriend.
XANDER: No, it was bad before that. Since you two went off to college and forgot about me, just left me in the basement to -- (suddenly, quietly) Tara's your girlfriend?
BUFFY: Enough. All I know is that you want to help, right? Be part of the team?
WILLOW: I don't know anymore--
WILLOW: I don't know anymore--
XANDER: Clearly not wanted--
BUFFY: No. You said you wanted to go. So let's go. All of us. We'll walk into that cave with you two attacking me and the funny drunk drooling on my shoes. Maybe that's the secret way to kill Adam.
XANDER: Buffy--
BUFFY: Is that it? Is that how you can help? You're not answering. Go on. How can you possibly help?
BUFFY: So… (steeling herself) So I guess I'm on my own. And you know what? I'm starting to get why there's no ancient prophesy about a Chosen One and Friends.
BUFFY: If I need help, I'll go to someone I can <u>count on</u>.
ADAM: I've been waiting for you.
RILEY: And now I'm here.
