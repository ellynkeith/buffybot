Riley Finn.
We have a friend in common.
The welcoming committee your idea?
Don't push me, boy.
(can't resist) That'd be between me and her.
See an old girlfriend.
You think you're gonna stop me?
Hey. Can I come in?
Need a little more than that, Buffy.
I'll live.
Not really. It's not world in peril stuff.
Buffy, please. I don't have a lot of time.
No. It was an accident-
(to Riley) Put that gun down.
(to Riley) Might hurt you.
Some threat. You can barely stand.
(to Buffy) You actually sleep with this guy?
Ow!
He started it --
Well, technically --
I was trying to make things better.
It's going pretty well, don't you think?
I couldn't leave it like that. The way I spoke to you… I came to apologize. I had no right.
I got jumped by some soldiers. He came in in the middle. Wasn't real forthcoming with the benefit of the doubt.
I get it.
I'm still sorry.
And next time I'll apologize by phone.
Things seem pretty tense around here.
Anything I can do?
Okay.
Oh. And… Riley?
(nods) I don't like him.
