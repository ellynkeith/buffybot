Happy Hal-lo, Buffy.
It's a sombrero.
It seemed festive. Come in.
Candy?
I've never said any such thing. As my watcher duties took  precedence, I simply hadn't taken the time to embrace its  inherent charms. Until now. Look!
It's alive!
Heh heh… see how he… shakes… (turns it off) Right, is there something you wanted?
I see. Is there some specific danger you're sensing?
True. But what happened then was anomalous. Creatures of the  night shy away from Halloween. They find it all much too crass.
I promise you, there's little chance of any supernatural activity tonight.
(mouth full) Jush mo-munt… Comeng…
Happy Ha-
Anya?
Where are Buffy and the others?
Slow down. I need you to be more specific.
She vanished from the window?
(thinking, to himself) Hmm. Reality and matter distortion… Like a summoning spell's temporal flux.
Nevermind. Let me get my supplies.
I shouldn't worry too much about Xander.  At least he's among friends.
We're going to have to create a door.
I can.
You may want to step back.
The walls closed up behind us.
Buffy, this is Gachnar.
(referencing book) I have it: "The summoning spell for Gachnar can be shut down in one of two ways. Destroying the Mark of Gachnar…"
"… is not one of them and will, in fact, immediately bring forth  the Fear Demon, itself."
Don't taunt the fear demon.
No, it's just… tacky. Be that as it may, Buffy, when it comes to slaying…
(reading) Please, finish them.
I should have translated - (showing her book) The Gaelic inscription under the illustration of Gachnar.
Actual size.
