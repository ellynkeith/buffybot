Ms. Summers. I want you to prepare  to lead a discussion group next class  on the paper topic. (re: Buffy's paper) That was smart work.
You have any questions, bring them  up with one of the TA's.
Hello?
God...
It was unbelievable. <u>Two</u> of them.  That I survived at all is a miracle-
I hope you're being careful when you  walk on campus after dark. I was  attacked by wild dogs last night.
Biggest tings I've ever seen. The first  one, I thought it was... well for a moment,  I thought it was a gorilla. My heart  practically stopped. (to Buffy) I know how it sounds. But crazy is my  specialty - and I definitely saw what  I saw.
Fine. See you in class.
