(to vamp) Thanks for the re-locate. I perform  better without an audience.
(agreeing) 'Cause of the gloating factor alone.  We're all about college now.  We've got heady discourse...
Right... So, if college is so great - what  are we doing here and why is it more fun?
Giles. Trouble?
(to Willow) So much for your predictable blanky  theory, Will.
(bemused) But it's your cutting edge 8-tracks that  keep you ahead of the scene.
I guess... If the Stones are still rolling, why can't Giles?  WILLOW (to Giles) Exactly, I think it's brave that you're here.
So Oz, what about you guy?  When's Dingoes playing here again?
Yeah. She's quell' Fiona. Color  me bored.
It - I... What do I-
I know - can you believe it!?
Except now she wants me to lead a  discussion group next class. Which  means more work, right? Shouldn't  she have a better reward system?  Like a cookie? Or maybe a little toy,  like at the dentist?
Great. I'm TA bound - but I'll catch  up with you guys. 
Oh. I thought that was the point.
(sympathetic) It doesn't mean anything, Will. So Oz  checks another girl. He loves you.
Please. Ten dollar ho. Fifteen, max.
You have them. But you don't act  on them.
See? I'm sure Oz is flogging and  punishing himself- (stops) This is sounding so wrong before I  even finish. (then) Point is - you're both human. But I  promise you, in a few days it'll be  like - Veruca who?
Absolutely. Oz just isn't the type to stray.
Excuse me, Ms. Walsh-
Wild dogs.
No. I believe you.
(distracted) No... Thanks. Just saying howdy.
Hi...
Pass on the tea. And the moose. But thanks.
Yep. Lucky for you, people may be  in danger.
Clearly - we need to get you kicking  some monster bootie, stat. So check it -  one of my professors said she almost got  attacked by two wild "dogs" last night.  Under the light of a nearly full moon.
Could be.
He's my next stop.
(finishing for him) ASAP. Promise.
Got out, huh?
No. But I did hear about a person being  chased by <u>two</u> "wild dogs."
You don't remember anything like that,  do you? Another wolf?
Must be spooky.
Sure.
Seems good to me... (then/teasingly) If I find werewolf #2 on patrol tonight -  you may have a roomie.
Oz? (off his look) Are you alright? If possible, you seem  even more monosyllabic than usual.
Willow!
Thank you. I was too far away-
(to Will) Willow. What's the matter?
I have to go. I have to find Veruca  before the sun sets.
I'll come back as soon as things are  taken care of. You just take it easy, okay? (then) Riley was right. The main thing is -  put the blame where it belongs.  Don't hurt yourself.
Where is she?
We'll try that, then.
(cutting him off) Oz. This might be a good time for  your trademark stoicism.
Or the dirty pile of clothes she left  lying on the ground. 
Unless she <u>wanted</u> to throw you off  the scent.
There was so much going on with Oz  and Will - there still is - but I thought  you should know about this.
And he was toting some serious weaponry... (then) Thing is, I saw some other guys dressed  exactly like him on Halloween night.  I assumed they were in costume...
I wanna know what's up. Guy got in  my way; I almost didn't catch up to  Oz in time. As it is, I was too late to...
I think right now she wishes I hadn't...  I've never seen her like this before,  Giles. It's like it hurts too much to  even form words.
Well, I ran away and went to hell - and  then I got through it. I'm kind of hoping  Willow won't use me as a model.
I just don't know how they're gonna  deal with this.
