Stand down, soldier.
Stand down before I put you down.
Man was in my way. I got places to be.
You know where I'm going.
You wouldn't understand.
I don't explain, because I don't have to.  I'm the one in charge.
(same temperament) Do they?
Family. Is that what we are?
Step aside.
Am I really worth all that?
No, a giant skewer through the ribcage hurt me. That was just a reminder.
I walked.
They did. Repeatedly. But then I told them they couldn't keep me without a major ass-kicking one way or another… and here I am.
Beg pardon?
Me, too. I know my behavior was pretty out there…
Taking Adam down is gonna be tough. No way to predict what he'll throw at us.
Me, neither. All I had in there was this one little part of you.
I'm serious. Knowing you were out there, that you cared… (then, abruptly) You think we're being watched?
Maybe.
Give me an order. That's what I do, isn't it? Follow orders?
Don't I? All my life, that's what I've been groomed to do. They say jump, I ask how high, and I get the job done. But I don't know if it's the right job anymore.
Ever obey them?
See, we're different that way. I just suck at the whole gray area thing.
You make it sound so simple. I don't even know what my way is.
I'm a soldier. You take that away, what's left?
(smiling) What are you doing?
Find any?
You sure about that?
He's probably working off an autonomic power-source, and because he's straight out of the box, needs to charge up awhile.
And that's a best-case scenario. I suppose a little firepower wouldn't hurt right now. Here.
Blasters are easy. Adam won't be.
(grins) Speak for yourself.
I'm just saying…
I'm not exactly sure what you'd call me. But I will share information. Least I can do.
Who's Faith?
Okay, I get it. Really. "Faith bad." Do I look like I'm arguing?
Figured that out, huh?
Damn, took Mom twelve years to catch that one. All I'm saying is, if you're in trouble, I want to help.
Give me one reason why.
Aah!
Okay, I'm not exactly action guy. But there's got to be something I can do besides sitting around waiting for you to pummel this gal.
I've never seen anybody get under your skin this way before. What did she do to you, exactly?
I'm from Iowa, we drive four hours for a high school football game. Try me.
There's something you're not telling me.
All right, I'm just saying, I think you're holding out on me.
