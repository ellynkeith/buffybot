Sure. Just as soon as I get my master's  degree in advanced starship technology.
(nods) Second. It's called a "Blaster," Will. The word  that tends to discourage experimentation. Now if it was called "The Orgasminator," I'd be first to  try your basic button-press approach.
Working on it, working on it… (mutters) But if I blow a hole into Mom's azalea patch,  the neighbors will not be pleased.
YOW!
So not a problem.
And I could go a long healthy stretch  without seeing anything like it again.
I really don't want to be around  for the final exam.
Question: will hiding in a cabin with  stockpiled chocolate goods be any part  of this plan?
(to Willow) Told you.
You want the stealthy-stuff?
That's great, Riley. And you know, there's no polite way to ask you this, but - did they put a chip in your brain?
Based on the clues? I'll go with "killing spree."
How'd you do that? How'd he do that? (grabs Blaster) Is there like an "On/Off" button somewhere in here?
Riley's right. It is the least he can do.
I'd say this qualifies for a worst- timing ever award.
Yeah - I'd hate to see the pursuit of a homicidal lunatic get in the way of pursuing a homicidal lunatic.
Good plan.
Been there, tried that. Not unlike smothering a forest fire with napalm, as I recall.
One word? Evil. (to Riley) No offense.
…Who she's doing…
…the point being, I could be the target here. Faith finds Mr. Xander Harris still in town - odds are she goes tighter than cat gut. Lot of pent-up feelings there. I'm only saying.
I can't be held responsible for the effect I have on women.
See, Faith and I have a little thing between us called "history."
Spike.
For your information, smarty, we've got a rogue slayer on our hands. Real psycho-killer, too.
Her. Dark hair, this tall, name of Faith, criminally insane…
In a bad way, yeah.
Go ahead - you wouldn't even recognize her.
We're dumb.
