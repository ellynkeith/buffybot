Nonsense. There's not a cloud in the sky. Now eat your sandwich.
You're too young and too pretty  a girl to start wearing worry lines  on your face. Oop…
There now, little fella. I don't know where you belong, but it's sure not here with us. There you go. (to Faith) You see? There's nothing that can spoil our time together.
Now who wants cheese cake?
I'm dead. And our noble campaign to bring order to the town of Sunnydale has failed, utterly and completely.
On the other hand - heck, maybe we won! And right now I'm on some jumbo monitor in the Richard Wilkins museum, surrounded by a bunch of kids sitting "Indian style" and looking up at my face, filled with fear and wonder. Hi, kids!
But the realist in me tends to  doubt it. Now Faith. As I record this message, you're… sleeping. And the doctors tell me you might never wake up. I don't believe that. Sooner or later, you'll  find the world has gone and changed on you. I wish I could make the world a better place for you to wake up in. But tough as it is to accept, we both have to understand that even my power to protect and watch over you has its limits.
The hard pill to swallow here is: once I'm gone, your days are just plain numbered. Now, I know you're a smart and capable young woman in charge of her own life but the problem, Faith, is that there won't be a place in the world for you anymore. Right now, I bet you're feeling very much alone. But you're never alone. You'll always have me. And, you'll always have this.
Go ahead, look in the envelope.
Don't worry, it won't bite. (laughs) That's my job.
Open it.
Surprise! You don't get these in any gumball machine. See, when you've been around as long as I have, you make friends, and some of them forge neat little gizmos like the one you're holding now. And here's the good news: Just because it's over for you, doesn't mean you can't go out with a bang.
