You have much anger and pain. Your  magic is strong, but your pain... it's like  a scream that pierces dimensional walls.  We heard your call.
Our intention is not to quash your  potential. (beat) Quite the contrary.
The pain and suffering you brought  upon those you love has been inspired.  You are ready to join us, here in  Arashmaharr.
But you did. This is the result of your  power. You will make a fine vengance  demon.  WILLOW No. please. You - you have to help  them.
That is your answer?
I'm sorry to hear that. Oh, well. Here's  my talisman. You change your mind,  give us a chant.
