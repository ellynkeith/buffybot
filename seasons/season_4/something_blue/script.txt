RILEY: There you go. Looks good.
BUFFY: (teasingly/re: banner) You have something to tell me?
RILEY: What?  (gets it) Oh. Yes, I am a lesbian.
BUFFY: It's good that you're open about it.  How are your parents dealing?
RILEY: They just want me to be happy.  Oh hey! You know we were talking  about having a picnic; I was thinking,  do you ever hang out at Ruggs Field?  It's beautiful there. Usually not that  crowded either. I thought maybe we  could have a little spread, sandwiches,  maybe some ants. (they stop) Could be fun.
BUFFY: We were talking about having  a picnic?
RILEY: Oh. Um, okay... (thinking) ... so was that a conversation we  actually had or just one I was  practicing?
BUFFY: (grasping the concept) Practicing.
RILEY: Okay, yes, I have been known to do  a little prep work before our  conversations. It's not easy, you know.  Talking to you, sometimes, it's like  an oral exam.
BUFFY: And that's just what every girl  longs to hear.
RILEY: Well you're tricky!
BUFFY: (smiling wryly) Like an exam.
RILEY: I never know how you're going to  react to something. That's why I  like you so much. You're a mystery. (laughs a bit) Probably every beautiful girl in the  world has some jerk telling her  she's a mystery, but I swear you really  are. There's a lot about you that  needs puzzling out.
BUFFY: Right around "beautiful".
RILEY: Say. Don'tchya just love a picnic?
BUFFY: It's just different, you know? A picnic -  first of all, daylight, kind of a new  venue Buffywise... and the best part,  he said he'd bring all the food. All I  have to do is show up and eat - two  things I'm really good at!  WILLOW So he's nice.
BUFFY: Very very.
WILLOW: And there's sparkage?
BUFFY: Oh yeah. He's just got - have you  looked at his arms? Those are good  arms to have. Riley is... I really like  him. I do...
WILLOW: But?
BUFFY: I don't know. I love being around him,  I think he cares about me, but...  I still feel like something's missing...
WILLOW: He's not making you miserable?
BUFFY: Exactly! (then) Riley seems so solid. Like he's not the  type to give a girl grief.
WILLOW: Get out. Get out while there's  still time.
BUFFY: I know. I gotta get over the whole bad  boy thing. There's no good there.  Seeing Angel in L.A. - even for five  minutes - hello to the pain.
WILLOW: (thinking of herself) The pain is not a friend.
BUFFY: But then I can't help thinking, isn't  that where the fire comes from?  Can a nice safe relationship be that  intense? It's nuts, but part of me  believes that real love and passion  have to go hand in hand with lots of pain and fighting-
BUFFY: (the millionth time) You saw their faces, but you can't  describe them.
SPIKE: Well... They were human... two eyes  each, kind of in the middle.
BUFFY: Uh-huh. And the lab....?
SPIKE: Underground. I came out through an  air vent, I don't know exactly where.  I'm done. Put the telly on.
BUFFY: That's it. The invalid amnesiac routine  is over. Kitchen closed 'til you tell me  something useful about the commandos.
SPIKE: I'm trying to remember. It was very  traumatic.
BUFFY: How long are you going to pull this crap?
SPIKE: How long am I gonna live once I tell you?
GILES: Spike, we've no intention of killing a  harmless creature. But we need to know  what's been done to you. We can't let you  go until we're sure you're impotent.
SPIKE: Hey!
GILES: Sorry. Poor choice of words.  'Til we know you're...
BUFFY: Flaccid?
SPIKE: You're one step away, missy -
BUFFY: Giles, help! He's gonna scold me!
SPIKE: Comfy? Do I look comfy? I'm chained  in a bathtub drinking pig's blood from  a novelty mug. Doesn't rate high in the  Zagat's guide.
BUFFY: You want something nicer?
SPIKE: Giles, make her stop!
BUFFY: You wanna start again?
SPIKE: You're inhuman.
GILES: If those two don't kill each other,  I might lend a hand.
WILLOW: What about a truth spell? I'm not positive  it'd work on a vampire, but we could try.  Make him fess up.
GILES: Of course. A truth spell. Why didn't  I think of that?
WILLOW: 'Cause you've got your hands full  with the unread English patient.
GILES: Yes, worth a go...
WILLOW: Looks pretty simple. I'll stop by the  majik shop tomorrow.
GILES: Excellent.
WILLOW: I'll be back in the morning with  donuts and motherwort. (calls out) Buff, I'll see you at home!
GILES: Great. Thank you, Willow.
GILES: Willow may have had a helpful idea. (closes the book) She seems to be coping better with  Oz' departure, don't you think?
BUFFY: She's still got a way to go, but yeah -  I think she's dealing.
SPIKE: What are you people, blind? She's  hanging on by a thread. (goes back to his blood)  Any ninny can see that.
WILLOW: Devon said he sent for his things.  I guess this means he's planning on  settling down somewhere. Else.  Not here.
BUFFY: Guess so.
WILLOW: I feel like I've been split down the  center. And half of me is lost.
BUFFY: I know. It feels like that now...
WILLOW: (can't believe it) Oz is gone.
GILES: (prompting) Oh, do pick up.
SPIKE: Come on now - it's telly time!
GILES: Willow, I thought you were bringing  ingredients for the truth spell.  I have to-
SPIKE: (cutting him off) "Passions" is on! Timmy's down a  bloody well and if you make me  miss it I'll -
GILES: (to Spike) You'll what? Lick me to death? (Back into phone) I really think we ought to try that truth  spell, Willow. Among other things,  I'd like to shower sometime today. Alone.
BUFFY: Driving.
RILEY: Yeah.
BUFFY: You seriously drive for fun?
RILEY: Not four-wheeling or anything.  But yeah. Don't you?
BUFFY: Actually, no-wheeling is more my  speciality. I'm an avid pedestrian,  though.
RILEY: You're kidding, right? I mean you  know how to drive.
BUFFY: I took the class. But cars and Buffy  are like - unmixy things.
RILEY: That's just cause you haven't had a  good experience yet. You can have  the best time in a car. It's not about  getting somewhere - you have to  take your time, forget about everything.  You just relax... let it wash over you,  the air, the motion... you just let it roll.
BUFFY: We are talking about driving, right?
RILEY: I thought I was... (gathering himself) I'm taking you. Some night when  it's warm, up past the vineyards...  change everything for you.
BUFFY: I'm in.
RILEY: Hi Willow.
WILLOW: I interrupted. You've got apples. My mis.
RILEY: Wait. (Willow turns back) Sit. Plenty to go around.
BUFFY: What - did something happen? What's wrong?
WILLOW: Nothing Everything's fine. Same.
BUFFY: Oh.
WILLOW: Your apples are... they're turning  brown. The way they do.
RILEY: Yeah, guess they do that.
BUFFY: Yeah.
WILLOW: Yeah.
XANDER: (to Buffy) Jeez. You mean Oz just sent for his  stuff and didn't even call her?  That's pretty harsh.
ANYA: (kindly) I only wish I had my powers back.  I'd liquify his entrails for her.
XANDER: (to Anya/genuine) That's sweet. (then) God. Poor Willow. No wonder she's...  having a wonderful time.
BUFFY: (perplexed) Wow. Way to rebound.
XANDER: I believe that is the dance of a brave  little toaster.
WILLOW: Hey! Come on you guys - this music  is great!
XANDER: Nice to see you brought your boogie  shoes tonight, Will.
WILLOW: Yeah - I know I've been a party poop  lately. So I said to myself - "Self" -  I said "time to shake and shimmy it off!"
BUFFY: (bemused) Sounds like a good policy.
WILLOW: Yep. And it works too...
BUFFY: - drunk?
WILLOW: Drunk is a pretty strong word. Kind of  an Anglo-Saxon word. Guttural.  "Drunk."
XANDER: Will, not loving the drowning of  the sorrows.
WILLOW: Not drowning. Wading. (flashes the beer) See? Light. No big.
BUFFY: No - big! Anybody remember when  Buffy had a fun beer fest and  went One Million Years BC?
XANDER: Sadly - without the fuzzy bikini.
ANYA: Off topic, Xander.
XANDER: Right. Helping now. (moves to Willow) How's about you give me the beer.
WILLOW: No! Why should I? I've got pain here.  Big time, legitimate pain-
XANDER: We've all got pain, Will-
WILLOW: (cutting him off) Like what? Poor me, I live in a basement?  Oh, yeah - that's dire!
BUFFY: I'm taking you home now.
WILLOW: I don't want to -
BUFFY: You'll thank me when you still have a  friend left in the morning.
WILLOW: I just can't stand feeling this way.  I want it to be over.
BUFFY: And it will be. I promise. But it's going  to take some time.
WILLOW: That's not good enough.
BUFFY: I know. But that's how it is. You have  to go through the pain.
WILLOW: Isn't there some way I can make it  go away? Just 'cause I say so?  Can't I make it go poof?
WILLOW: Control the outside. Control within.  Land and sea, fire and wind.
WILLOW: It is my will that my heart be healed.  Now.
GILES: I was concerned about you, actually.
WILLOW: (irked) Did Buffy tell you about the beer?  Cause-
GILES: Buffy didn't tell me anything.
WILLOW: Oh. Forget the beer part then.
GILES: Happily. (then) I came because we had an  appointment the other day.
WILLOW: (oops) Oh. Right... The truth spell.
GILES: (kindly) Willow. I know you're going through  a very difficult time. But shirking  your responsibilities...
WILLOW: But I didn't. Shirk. I did the research....
GILES: Which isn't like you. At all.
WILLOW: I know. I've been off. I even tried doing  a spell last night, to have my will done?  I was hoping it would make me better. But it  went kablooey.
GILES: A spell? I don't think it's wise for you  to be doing that alone right now.  Your energy is too unfocused.
WILLOW: That's not true. I said I was off.  Not incompetent.
GILES: I only meant that you're grieving, and it  might be best if you took a break  from doing spells without supervision.
WILLOW: So I get punished 'cause I'm in pain.
GILES: It's not punishment. I'm saying this  because-
WILLOW: (cutting him off) You care. Right. Everybody cares. But  nobody wants to be inconvenienced.  You all want me to "take the time to go  through the pain" as long as you don't  have to hear about it anymore!
GILES: That's not fair.
WILLOW: Isn't it? 'Cause I'm doing the best I can -  and that doesn't seem to be enough  for you guys!
GILES: And I see how you could feel that  way. I do-
WILLOW: No! You don't. You say you do - but  you don't see anything!
GILES: Hm. I'm sorry. (little confused) I'm sorry. Perhaps... I should be going.  Let's - let's talk later.
GILES: Oh sorry, so sorry.
GILES: Enemy, enemy , be now quiet -
SPIKE: You know - not too keen on this spell  stuff. Tends to be a bit unpredictable.
GILES: Might have thought of that a bit sooner. (returns to spell) Let your deceitful tongue be.. (having trouble reading the book) ...broken. Let no untruths... (more squinting) ... be spoken.
SPIKE: Hey what's that all about?
GILES: I - nothing. Just an ash in my eye.
SPIKE: Well, I won't have you doing mojo  on me if you can't read properly.  You could turn me into a stink beetle  or what all.
GILES: And that would be a generous end  for the likes of you, Spike. Now I'll ask  you to kindly bugger off while I finish.
SPIKE: Thanks, but - I think I'd rather go with my plan.
WILLOW: I mean, I'm going through something,  and I just don't see why he was  getting down on me.
BUFFY: Giles just worries. Spells can be really  dangerous. It doesn't mean he thinks  you're a bad witch.
WILLOW: I am a bad witch.
BUFFY: No, you're a good witch!
WILLOW: I'm not kidding anyone. If I had any  real power I could've made Oz stay  with me.
BUFFY: Yeah, but you don't want him to stay  because you -
WILLOW: I didn't have the guts to do a spell on  Veruca, my "I will it so" spell went  nowhere, the only real witch in here is  fuzzy little Amy!
BUFFY: You're being too -
WILLOW: She's got access to forces I can't even  invoke! I mean she's a perfectly normal  girl...
WILLOW: I could never do something like that.
BUFFY: So she did a good spell - but the plan  kind of sucked. I mean, she's the one  stuck eating pellets out of a plastic cup-
BUFFY: Spike escaped.
WILLOW: (meekly) So you're going? Right now?
BUFFY: Sorry. Duty thing.
WILLOW: But - what's the rush? I mean. Spike  can't hurt anybody, right? I figured,  seeing as how I'm kinda grievey, we  could have a girl night. You know -  eat sundaes and then watch Steel  Magnolias and you could tell me how  at least I don't have diabetes-
BUFFY: Willow. I can't hang with you until I get  Spike back to Giles'. You know that.
WILLOW: I don't see the big. He's probably just  standing out there, you'll find him in  two seconds.
BUFFY: I thought that was going to take longer.
SPIKE: (realizing) Me too - I musta got turned around. (noticing something) Hang on... this....
BUFFY: What are you talking about?
SPIKE: The lab. Commando lab. Door was  right here. Where I escaped.
BUFFY: I don't think so.
SPIKE: (yelling at ground) Open up! I'm going to kill you!
BUFFY: Spike, there's nothing here.
SPIKE: (yelling, more hopelessly) Let me in! Fix me!
BUFFY: (pulls him up) Drop the act.
SPIKE: Get off me!
BUFFY: That's it. I'm gagging you.
SPIKE: Aaaarrr!!
SPIKE: Watchit!
BUFFY: One more word out of you and I  swear -
SPIKE: Swear what? You're not going to do  anything to me. You don't have  the stones.
BUFFY: Oh, I've got the stones. I've got a whole... bunch of stones.
SPIKE: Yeah, you're all talk.
BUFFY: (calls out) Giles! I accidentally killed Spike!  That's okay, right?
GILES: (sighs) Just a minute...
WILLOW: ...I mean, I'm going through something -  and you'd think, every once in a while  Buffy could make best friends a priority.
XANDER: You know, Will, it's not like she could  just let Spike go...
SPIKE: I get this spell reversed, they'll be  finding your body for weeks.
BUFFY: Make a move. Please. I'm dying for  good slay.
WILLOW: Spike's more important than Willow.  I get it.
XANDER: Buffy's gotta find out what's up with  those commandoes. Right now she  needs Spike!
WILLOW: Well fine! Why doesn't she just go  marry him?
BUFFY: It's just so.. So sudden! I don't know  what to say!
SPIKE: Just say yes, and make me the happiest  man on earth.
BUFFY: Oh, Spike! Of course it's yes!
WILLOW: It's just not fair.
XANDER: (softer) Will. I know it's hard to see I right  now. But everything you're feeling  is 'cause of you and Oz. Not 'cause  of Buffy or me or anybody. But,  eventually you'll meet someone else  and it'll be better.
WILLOW: Because most relationships are great  and trouble-free, right? I don't think so.  I think we're all doomed to badness.
XANDER: We're not doomed.
WILLOW: Oh yeah, let's look at your bio:  Mummy girl. Insect lady. Anya.  You're a ..... demon magnet.
XANDER: Hey, I was just trying to help.
WILLOW: (sulks) Great. Now you're mad at me too.
GILES: Willow, it's me. Something's happened  and... I need your help. I...I can't see  very well. Everything's a blur. I'm  certain it must be some sort of spell,  because, uh well there seems to be  something else going .. wrong.
BUFFY: Here you go, Sweetie. Ninety-eight point six.
GILES: (still into phone) Horribly wrong.
BUFFY: Ceremony, guests, reception... there's  so much to decide.
SPIKE: Well, first thing, I'd say we're NOT  having a church wedding.
BUFFY: How about a daytime ceremony  in the park?
SPIKE: Fabulous. Enjoy your honeymoon  with the big pile of dust.
BUFFY: (getting impatient) Under the trees. Indirect sunlight only.
SPIKE: A warm spring breeze tosses the leaves  aside and, again, you're registering as  Mr. And Mrs. Big pile of dust.
BUFFY: Okay, stop it! This is our wedding and  you're treating it like a huge joke!
SPIKE: Ooh. Pouty, look at the lip. Gonna  get it. Gonna get it.
BUFFY: Stop!
GILES: Sits on the couch, resting his eyes.
GILES: Yes, please stop.
BUFFY: Giles? Did you see my ring?
GILES: Thankfully, not very well.
BUFFY: Giles, I... I'm not crazy; I know you  probably don't approve... and my  Dad's not that far away, I could  probably... but this day is about  family, my real family. And I want  it to be you that gives me away.
GILES: Buffy, I... That's so...
BUFFY: (looks to Spike) Living the dream.
SPIKE: He's going to have to take a bit of time to get to used to it, pet.
BUFFY: I guess they all will. They weren't  crazy about Angel at first.
SPIKE: You weren't going to say that name.
BUFFY: Sorry. Let's talk about where we  should register.
SPIKE: Where would Angel want to register?  And can we the photographer Angel  would have wanted and the flowers  Angel would have liked?
BUFFY: Hey, you think the shadow of Drusilla  isn't hanging over me? That I won't  be wondering if you're thinking about  her on our honeymoon when you're  making sweet love to me?
GILES: I rather think not. I seem to be rather.. (beat, scared) rather blind. Completely, in fact.
BUFFY: What? How could that happen?
GILES: A spell, I believe.
BUFFY: We'll fix it, don't worry.
SPIKE: What you need is a general reversal  spell. Gonna need supplies.
GILES: (suspiciously) You're going to help me?
SPIKE: Well.. It's like you're almost my  father-in-law, innit?
BUFFY: See, this is how it'll be from now on.  Spike'll even take care of you while  I'm at the majik shop. From now on,  he's family.
GILES: It's all right.... I have more scotch...
BUFFY: Oh! Look...
RILEY: Hey, Buffy . What's up?
RILEY: Um, yeah, they're nice. A little dressy,  maybe, for school, but...
BUFFY: (sweet regret) Riley..
RILEY: (confusion) Buffy...
BUFFY: I really like you. I hope know that  you mean a lot to me. And if things  were different...
RILEY: Different then what?
BUFFY: You have to promise me that we'll  always be friends. And I want  you to be there on the day.
RILEY: The day when...
BUFFY: The wedding!
RILEY: The wedding! What wedding?
BUFFY: My wedding! I'm getting married!  Can you believe it?
RILEY: I don't think "no" is a strong enough  word.
BUFFY: It's crazy, I know, I mean we've been  fighting for years and then - sometimes  you just look at each and you know,  you know?
RILEY: No.
BUFFY: I think maybe we fought so much  because we didn't know how to  admit what we felt.
RILEY: Can we start again?
BUFFY: I really think you'd like him. Well,  nobody really likes him...
RILEY: I'd just like to clear up a few things -
BUFFY: I don't really like him...
RILEY: Buffy.
BUFFY: ... but I love him. I do.
RILEY: Who?
BUFFY: What?
RILEY: What's his name?
BUFFY: Who?
RILEY: The groom.
BUFFY: Spike.
RILEY: That's a name?
BUFFY: Don't be mad.
RILEY: I'm not mad.
BUFFY: No, you are.
RILEY: No, I am. I really - wow. Who is this  guy? Does he go here?
BUFFY: Spike? Oh no, he's totally old.
RILEY: Old?
BUFFY: (chuckling) Well, he's not as old as my last  boyfriend, but -
RILEY: Okay. It's late. And I'm very tired now,  so... I'm going to go far away, and  be... away.
BUFFY: But -
RILEY: (firmly) No. (leaving) Stay.
XANDER: (called up) That's okay, Mom... we don't need any  more snacks!
ANYA: (to Xander) I liked those fruit roll-ups.
XANDER: Shush. I thought she'd never clear out.  Besides, just think of my lips as the  fruit roll-ups of love. (off her look) Okay that was gross. I'm a little distracted.  Willow was really upset. I shouldn't've  let her go away mad.
ANYA: We just got rid of your mom, let's not  bring Willow into this. It's time  for just the two of us.
XANDER: What the hell is going on?
GILES: So the plan is to cure my total incapacitating  blindness tomorrow, is it?
BUFFY: They were out of Taggis Root. They'll  have more tomorrow. I'm completely  on top of this. (re cake couple) Aren't they a perfect little us?
SPIKE: I don't like him. He's insipid. Clearly  human.
BUFFY: How about red paint... we can smear his  little mouth - the blood of the innocent.
SPIKE: That's my girl.
GILES: Stop that! Right now! I can hear the  smacking.
BUFFY: Honey, we have to talk about invitations.  Do you want to be "William the Bloody"  or, like just "Spike"? 'Cause either way  it's gonna look majorly weird.
SPIKE: Whereas the name "Buffy" gives it that  touch of classic elegance.
BUFFY: What's wrong with Buffy?
GILES: Such a good question.
SPIKE: Well, it's a terrible name.
BUFFY: My mother picked that name!
SPIKE: Your mother. Yeah, she's a genius.
BUFFY: Oh, don't you start on my mother!
XANDER: Board up the windows! Barricade the  doors!
GILES: What's going on?
ANYA: Demons. They keep coming and  coming!
XANDER: I think we lost them. I didn't see -
BUFFY: Xander, calm down. If you lost them,  we have a little time to figure this out.  Maybe it's related to Giles being blind.  ANYA Giles is blind?
GILES: Stop whatever you're doing. You smell  like fruit roll-ups.
SPIKE: This is the crack team that foils my  every plan? I am deeply shamed.
BUFFY: Spike's right. We have to get organized.
ANYA: Why are you holding hands?
SPIKE: They have to hear it sooner or later...
BUFFY: Spike and I are getting married.
XANDER: (to Giles) How? What? How?
GILES: Three excellent questions.
SPIKE: (soft mock threat) What are you looking at?
BUFFY: (equally intimate) The man I love.
XANDER: (off the kiss, to Giles) Can I be blind too? (then) Wait. Married. I know something.  What is it? This is all so familiar.  Work, brain, work. Oh! Oh-oh!  Willow!
BUFFY: (through the kiss) What about Willow? Get off me,  Honey.
XANDER: (still thinking) Something about Willow and her grief-y  poor-me mood swings. So, so tired of it.
ANYA: You mean I don't have to be nice to  her anymore?
BUFFY: We're all tired of it, but what's it have  to do with what's going on?
XANDER: She told me I was a demon magnet. And..  And she said you two should get married.
GILES: And that I didn't see anything.
BUFFY: She did a spell.
GILES: Yes, to have her will done. Whatever  she says is coming true.
BUFFY: And both you guys were affected.  I probably only escaped it because  I'm the Slayer. Some kind of natural  immunity.
XANDER: Yeah. Right. You're marrying Spike  because you're so right for each other.
BUFFY: Xander...
SPIKE: That's it. You're off the usher list.
GILES: People... Willow's still out there, and  she probably has no idea what she's  doing.
XANDER: We've gotta find her -
BUFFY: Before someone really gets hurt.
XANDER: (re: Spike) Why does he have to come?
BUFFY: Xander, Spike is going to be my husband.  I want him included.
SPIKE: I think I agree with Xander here. Seems  like a lot of work for people who aren't us.
BUFFY: Spike, these are my friends. And, by  the way, this is kind of my job.
SPIKE: For now.
BUFFY: What are you saying, you want me  to stop working?
SPIKE: Let's see, would I like you to give up  killing my friends? Yeah, I've given  it a thought!
BUFFY: This was burned.
ANYA: D'Hoffryn - the bastard - he opened  a portal here.
BUFFY: Who?
SPIKE: Oooh. Fluffy. Wear this to the rehearsal  dinner and the whole thing's off.
BUFFY: Shut up, Honey.
ANYA: D'Hoffryn is one of the lower beings.  He made me a demon eleven hundred  and twenty years ago.
BUFFY: Why would he attack Willow?
ANYA: I don't believe he did.
HOFFRYN: You have much anger and pain. Your  magic is strong, but your pain... it's like  a scream that pierces dimensional walls.  We heard your call.
WILLOW: I'm sorry. I'll try for a quiet rage. Bye.
HOFFRYN: Our intention is not to quash your  potential. (beat) Quite the contrary.
ANYA: I'd been dumped, I was miserable.  Doing a few vengeance spells -  boils on the penis, nothing fancy.
XANDER: Please skip ahead.
ANYA: The lower beings got wind of me,  they offered to elevate me.
BUFFY: Meaning?
ANYA: They made me a demon.
BUFFY: Oh god, Willow... so you can summon  the demon from this crypt place? Get  him to stop- (without slowing) hey, wouldn't this make a pretty back  drop for photographs?
SPIKE: I'm not posing for chuff-all.
XANDER: Hey! Demon!
BUFFY: Listen, we're gonna do this without  destroying the foliage.
ANYA: Blessed be the name of D'Hoffryn.  Let this space be now a gateway to the  world of Arashmaharr where demons  are spawned.
HOFFRYN: The pain and suffering you brought  upon those you love has been inspired.  You are ready to join us, here in  Arashmaharr.
WILLOW: (truly surprised) Pain? What pain?
SPIKE: Buffy!
XANDER: We're not doing well here...
ANYA: We come in supplication, we bend as  the reed in the flow of... no wait, we  come in the flow of the... gnyah! (starts again) Blessed be the name of D'Hoffryn...
SPIKE: They're strong, and I can't fight.  If they get in, I don't know if I can  protect you.
BUFFY: (bristling) You think you have to protect me?
SPIKE: Oh, not with the girl power bit -
WILLOW: Oh. God. But I didn't mean to-
HOFFRYN: But you did. This is the result of your  power. You will make a fine vengance  demon.  WILLOW No. please. You - you have to help  them.
WILLOW: Really. No offense intended, I mean,  you've been super nice and everything...  But, I don't want to be a demon. I want  to go back and help my friends.
HOFFRYN: That is your answer?
WILLOW: It is.
HOFFRYN: I'm sorry to hear that. Oh, well. Here's  my talisman. You change your mind,  give us a chant.
BUFFY: Honey!
XANDER: Little help here!
BUFFY: Spike, are you okay?
SPIKE: Slayer…
WILLOW: Let the healing power begin. Let my Will be safe again. As these words Of peace are spoken, let this harmful Spell… be broken.
BUFFY: Spike lips, lips of Spike…
WILLOW: Hi guys.
ANYA: How long are you going to keep  making these?
WILLOW: Until I don't feel so horribly guilty.  I figure, about a million from now.  Also I have to detail Giles' car.
XANDER: (to Giles) Time?
GILES: Five past two! Clear as day!
WILLOW: Look, cookies! A very non-evil thing I  did. Oatmeal.
GILES: Tricky girl! They're chocolate chip.  I can see them. (Beat) Still need glasses, though. Guess you  couldn't be more specific and given  me twenty-twenty.
WILLOW: Eat a cookie, ease my pain?
BUFFY: Better?
WILLOW: Well, baking lifts at least thirty percent  of my guilt. But only seven percent of  my inner turmoil. (beat) That'll take a while, I guess.
BUFFY: It'll happen.
SPIKE: Don't I get a cookie?
BUFFY: No.
SPIKE: I gotta have something. I still got Buffy  taste in my mouth.
BUFFY: You're a pig.
SPIKE: Yeah, well I'm not the one who wanted  "Wind Beneath My Wings"  for the first dance.
BUFFY: That was the spell.
WILLOW: Did I mention about the sorry part?
BUFFY: We may be into a forgetting spell  later. I loved him. We were betrothed.
WILLOW: At least you were getting along...
BUFFY: We weren't! It wasn't even nice. The  bad boy thing? Over it. I get it now.  I'd be really happy to be in a nice  relationship with a decent reliable  oh my GOD Riley thinks I'm engaged.
WILLOW: What?
BUFFY: (hyperventilating) Riley. He saw me... and.. What the hell  am I gonna say to him?
BUFFY: You thought I was serious?
RILEY: Well... no. I mean - you weren't serious?
BUFFY: Oh , God. Right. I'm marrying a guy named Spike.
RILEY: Maybe. We haven't known each other that long.
BUFFY: No, no... It's just - I saw that fear in  your eyes when you caught me looking  at wedding dresses, and I had to give you  a hard time.
RILEY: What? I didn't have fear in my eyes.
BUFFY: Yes you did. You were looking at me  like I was a cartoon ball and chain.
RILEY: So you decided to tell me you were  getting married.
BUFFY: (is this working?) Uh huh...
RILEY: So.... you're insane.
BUFFY: Uh huh...
RILEY: But you're still single.
BUFFY: Yes.
RILEY: Okay then. Just another piece of the  Buffy puzzle.
BUFFY: You've got a lot to learn about women.
RILEY: You're gonna teach me.
