Well... They were human... two eyes  each, kind of in the middle.
Underground. I came out through an  air vent, I don't know exactly where.  I'm done. Put the telly on.
I'm trying to remember. It was very  traumatic.
How long am I gonna live once I tell you?
Hey!
You're one step away, missy -
Comfy? Do I look comfy? I'm chained  in a bathtub drinking pig's blood from  a novelty mug. Doesn't rate high in the  Zagat's guide.
Giles, make her stop!
You're inhuman.
What are you people, blind? She's  hanging on by a thread. (goes back to his blood)  Any ninny can see that.
Come on now - it's telly time!
(cutting him off) "Passions" is on! Timmy's down a  bloody well and if you make me  miss it I'll -
You know - not too keen on this spell  stuff. Tends to be a bit unpredictable.
Hey what's that all about?
Well, I won't have you doing mojo  on me if you can't read properly.  You could turn me into a stink beetle  or what all.
Thanks, but - I think I'd rather go with my plan.
(realizing) Me too - I musta got turned around. (noticing something) Hang on... this....
The lab. Commando lab. Door was  right here. Where I escaped.
(yelling at ground) Open up! I'm going to kill you!
(yelling, more hopelessly) Let me in! Fix me!
Get off me!
Aaaarrr!!
Watchit!
Swear what? You're not going to do  anything to me. You don't have  the stones.
Yeah, you're all talk.
I get this spell reversed, they'll be  finding your body for weeks.
Just say yes, and make me the happiest  man on earth.
Well, first thing, I'd say we're NOT  having a church wedding.
Fabulous. Enjoy your honeymoon  with the big pile of dust.
A warm spring breeze tosses the leaves  aside and, again, you're registering as  Mr. And Mrs. Big pile of dust.
Ooh. Pouty, look at the lip. Gonna  get it. Gonna get it.
He's going to have to take a bit of time to get to used to it, pet.
You weren't going to say that name.
Where would Angel want to register?  And can we the photographer Angel  would have wanted and the flowers  Angel would have liked?
What you need is a general reversal  spell. Gonna need supplies.
Well.. It's like you're almost my  father-in-law, innit?
I don't like him. He's insipid. Clearly  human.
That's my girl.
Whereas the name "Buffy" gives it that  touch of classic elegance.
Well, it's a terrible name.
Your mother. Yeah, she's a genius.
This is the crack team that foils my  every plan? I am deeply shamed.
They have to hear it sooner or later...
(soft mock threat) What are you looking at?
That's it. You're off the usher list.
I think I agree with Xander here. Seems  like a lot of work for people who aren't us.
For now.
Let's see, would I like you to give up  killing my friends? Yeah, I've given  it a thought!
Oooh. Fluffy. Wear this to the rehearsal  dinner and the whole thing's off.
I'm not posing for chuff-all.
Buffy!
They're strong, and I can't fight.  If they get in, I don't know if I can  protect you.
Oh, not with the girl power bit -
Slayerâ€¦
Don't I get a cookie?
I gotta have something. I still got Buffy  taste in my mouth.
Yeah, well I'm not the one who wanted  "Wind Beneath My Wings"  for the first dance.
