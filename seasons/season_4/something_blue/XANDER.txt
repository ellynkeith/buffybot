(to Buffy) Jeez. You mean Oz just sent for his  stuff and didn't even call her?  That's pretty harsh.
(to Anya/genuine) That's sweet. (then) God. Poor Willow. No wonder she's...  having a wonderful time.
I believe that is the dance of a brave  little toaster.
Nice to see you brought your boogie  shoes tonight, Will.
Will, not loving the drowning of  the sorrows.
Sadly - without the fuzzy bikini.
Right. Helping now. (moves to Willow) How's about you give me the beer.
We've all got pain, Will-
You know, Will, it's not like she could  just let Spike go...
Buffy's gotta find out what's up with  those commandoes. Right now she  needs Spike!
(softer) Will. I know it's hard to see I right  now. But everything you're feeling  is 'cause of you and Oz. Not 'cause  of Buffy or me or anybody. But,  eventually you'll meet someone else  and it'll be better.
We're not doomed.
Hey, I was just trying to help.
(called up) That's okay, Mom... we don't need any  more snacks!
Shush. I thought she'd never clear out.  Besides, just think of my lips as the  fruit roll-ups of love. (off her look) Okay that was gross. I'm a little distracted.  Willow was really upset. I shouldn't've  let her go away mad.
What the hell is going on?
Board up the windows! Barricade the  doors!
I think we lost them. I didn't see -
(to Giles) How? What? How?
(off the kiss, to Giles) Can I be blind too? (then) Wait. Married. I know something.  What is it? This is all so familiar.  Work, brain, work. Oh! Oh-oh!  Willow!
(still thinking) Something about Willow and her grief-y  poor-me mood swings. So, so tired of it.
She told me I was a demon magnet. And..  And she said you two should get married.
Yeah. Right. You're marrying Spike  because you're so right for each other.
We've gotta find her -
(re: Spike) Why does he have to come?
Please skip ahead.
Hey! Demon!
We're not doing well here...
Little help here!
(to Giles) Time?
