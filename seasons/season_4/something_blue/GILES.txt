Spike, we've no intention of killing a  harmless creature. But we need to know  what's been done to you. We can't let you  go until we're sure you're impotent.
Sorry. Poor choice of words.  'Til we know you're...
If those two don't kill each other,  I might lend a hand.
Of course. A truth spell. Why didn't  I think of that?
Yes, worth a go...
Excellent.
Great. Thank you, Willow.
Willow may have had a helpful idea. (closes the book) She seems to be coping better with  Oz' departure, don't you think?
(prompting) Oh, do pick up.
Willow, I thought you were bringing  ingredients for the truth spell.  I have to-
(to Spike) You'll what? Lick me to death? (Back into phone) I really think we ought to try that truth  spell, Willow. Among other things,  I'd like to shower sometime today. Alone.
I was concerned about you, actually.
Buffy didn't tell me anything.
Happily. (then) I came because we had an  appointment the other day.
(kindly) Willow. I know you're going through  a very difficult time. But shirking  your responsibilities...
Which isn't like you. At all.
A spell? I don't think it's wise for you  to be doing that alone right now.  Your energy is too unfocused.
I only meant that you're grieving, and it  might be best if you took a break  from doing spells without supervision.
It's not punishment. I'm saying this  because-
That's not fair.
And I see how you could feel that  way. I do-
Hm. I'm sorry. (little confused) I'm sorry. Perhaps... I should be going.  Let's - let's talk later.
Oh sorry, so sorry.
Enemy, enemy , be now quiet -
Might have thought of that a bit sooner. (returns to spell) Let your deceitful tongue be.. (having trouble reading the book) ...broken. Let no untruths... (more squinting) ... be spoken.
I - nothing. Just an ash in my eye.
And that would be a generous end  for the likes of you, Spike. Now I'll ask  you to kindly bugger off while I finish.
(sighs) Just a minute...
Willow, it's me. Something's happened  and... I need your help. I...I can't see  very well. Everything's a blur. I'm  certain it must be some sort of spell,  because, uh well there seems to be  something else going .. wrong.
(still into phone) Horribly wrong.
Sits on the couch, resting his eyes.
Yes, please stop.
Thankfully, not very well.
Buffy, I... That's so...
I rather think not. I seem to be rather.. (beat, scared) rather blind. Completely, in fact.
A spell, I believe.
(suspiciously) You're going to help me?
It's all right.... I have more scotch...
So the plan is to cure my total incapacitating  blindness tomorrow, is it?
Stop that! Right now! I can hear the  smacking.
Such a good question.
What's going on?
Stop whatever you're doing. You smell  like fruit roll-ups.
Three excellent questions.
And that I didn't see anything.
Yes, to have her will done. Whatever  she says is coming true.
People... Willow's still out there, and  she probably has no idea what she's  doing.
Five past two! Clear as day!
Tricky girl! They're chocolate chip.  I can see them. (Beat) Still need glasses, though. Guess you  couldn't be more specific and given  me twenty-twenty.
