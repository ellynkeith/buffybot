And there's sparkage?
But?
He's not making you miserable?
Get out. Get out while there's  still time.
(thinking of herself) The pain is not a friend.
What about a truth spell? I'm not positive  it'd work on a vampire, but we could try.  Make him fess up.
'Cause you've got your hands full  with the unread English patient.
Looks pretty simple. I'll stop by the  majik shop tomorrow.
I'll be back in the morning with  donuts and motherwort. (calls out) Buff, I'll see you at home!
Devon said he sent for his things.  I guess this means he's planning on  settling down somewhere. Else.  Not here.
I feel like I've been split down the  center. And half of me is lost.
(can't believe it) Oz is gone.
I interrupted. You've got apples. My mis.
Nothing Everything's fine. Same.
Your apples are... they're turning  brown. The way they do.
Yeah.
Hey! Come on you guys - this music  is great!
Yeah - I know I've been a party poop  lately. So I said to myself - "Self" -  I said "time to shake and shimmy it off!"
Yep. And it works too...
Drunk is a pretty strong word. Kind of  an Anglo-Saxon word. Guttural.  "Drunk."
Not drowning. Wading. (flashes the beer) See? Light. No big.
No! Why should I? I've got pain here.  Big time, legitimate pain-
(cutting him off) Like what? Poor me, I live in a basement?  Oh, yeah - that's dire!
I don't want to -
I just can't stand feeling this way.  I want it to be over.
That's not good enough.
Isn't there some way I can make it  go away? Just 'cause I say so?  Can't I make it go poof?
Control the outside. Control within.  Land and sea, fire and wind.
It is my will that my heart be healed.  Now.
(irked) Did Buffy tell you about the beer?  Cause-
Oh. Forget the beer part then.
(oops) Oh. Right... The truth spell.
But I didn't. Shirk. I did the research....
I know. I've been off. I even tried doing  a spell last night, to have my will done?  I was hoping it would make me better. But it  went kablooey.
That's not true. I said I was off.  Not incompetent.
So I get punished 'cause I'm in pain.
(cutting him off) You care. Right. Everybody cares. But  nobody wants to be inconvenienced.  You all want me to "take the time to go  through the pain" as long as you don't  have to hear about it anymore!
Isn't it? 'Cause I'm doing the best I can -  and that doesn't seem to be enough  for you guys!
No! You don't. You say you do - but  you don't see anything!
I mean, I'm going through something,  and I just don't see why he was  getting down on me.
I am a bad witch.
I'm not kidding anyone. If I had any  real power I could've made Oz stay  with me.
I didn't have the guts to do a spell on  Veruca, my "I will it so" spell went  nowhere, the only real witch in here is  fuzzy little Amy!
She's got access to forces I can't even  invoke! I mean she's a perfectly normal  girl...
I could never do something like that.
(meekly) So you're going? Right now?
But - what's the rush? I mean. Spike  can't hurt anybody, right? I figured,  seeing as how I'm kinda grievey, we  could have a girl night. You know -  eat sundaes and then watch Steel  Magnolias and you could tell me how  at least I don't have diabetes-
I don't see the big. He's probably just  standing out there, you'll find him in  two seconds.
...I mean, I'm going through something -  and you'd think, every once in a while  Buffy could make best friends a priority.
Spike's more important than Willow.  I get it.
Well fine! Why doesn't she just go  marry him?
It's just not fair.
Because most relationships are great  and trouble-free, right? I don't think so.  I think we're all doomed to badness.
Oh yeah, let's look at your bio:  Mummy girl. Insect lady. Anya.  You're a ..... demon magnet.
(sulks) Great. Now you're mad at me too.
I'm sorry. I'll try for a quiet rage. Bye.
(truly surprised) Pain? What pain?
Oh. God. But I didn't mean to-
Really. No offense intended, I mean,  you've been super nice and everything...  But, I don't want to be a demon. I want  to go back and help my friends.
It is.
Let the healing power begin. Let my Will be safe again. As these words Of peace are spoken, let this harmful Spellâ€¦ be broken.
Hi guys.
Until I don't feel so horribly guilty.  I figure, about a million from now.  Also I have to detail Giles' car.
Look, cookies! A very non-evil thing I  did. Oatmeal.
Eat a cookie, ease my pain?
Well, baking lifts at least thirty percent  of my guilt. But only seven percent of  my inner turmoil. (beat) That'll take a while, I guess.
Did I mention about the sorry part?
At least you were getting along...
What?
