Well, what am I supposed to think?
You don't care about what I think, you don't ask about my day...
See? And you make jokes during my pain. You don't care about me at all.
How much?
I think we should talk about it now!
I don't! This isn't a relationship. You don't need me! All you care about is lots of orgasms!
This is important.
What?
Oh. You mean an orgasm friend.
What about us? Our romantic evening?
So you're blowing off our evening. Because you don't care about me.
