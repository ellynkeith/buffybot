We have this breaking news item from Sunnydale California: Apparently the entire town has been quarantined due to an epidemic of -- as strange as this may sound -- <b>laryngitis</b>. It seems the entire town has been rendered unable to speak. There is no word yet what might have caused this or what other effects might be seen from this epidemic. Local authorities have issued a statement -- a written statement, I should say -- blaming recent flu vaccinations. A few skeptics call it a city-wide hoax. In the meanwhile, Sunnydale has effectively shut down; all schools and businesses will be closed for the time being, and residents are advised to stay home and rest up. The Center for Disease Control has ordered the entire town quarantined -- no one can go in or out -- until the syndrome is identified or the symptoms disappear. We'll bring you more on that as it develops.
