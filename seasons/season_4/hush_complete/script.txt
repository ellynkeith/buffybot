MAGGIE: So this is what it is. Talking about communication, talking about language. Not the same thing. It's about the way a child can recognize and produce phonemes that don't occur in its native language. It's about inspiration, not the idea but the moment before the idea when it's total, when it blossoms in your mind and connects to everything, before the coherent thought that gives it shape, that locks it in and cuts it off from the universal. When you can articulate it, it becomes smaller. It's about thoughts and experiences that we don't have a word for. A demonstration. Buffy Summers.
BUFFY: What?
MAGGIE: Go ahead. You're perfectly safe.
RILEY: A demonstration, right?
MAGGIE: Be a good boy.
BUFFY: This feels very strange.
RILEY: Don't worry. If I kiss you, it'll make the sun go down.
BUFFY: Fortune favors the brave...
RILEY: Along came a spider...
GIRL: Can't even shout. Can't even cry. The Gentlemen are coming by. Looking in windows, knocking on doors... They need to take seven and they might take yours...
MAGGIE: So I'll see you all Monday for a final review session.
WILLOW: Boy, that was an exciting class, huh?
BUFFY: Oh yeah. Wow.
WILLOW: And that last twenty minutes -- it was a revelation. Just laid out everything we needed to know for the final. I'd hate to have missed that.
BUFFY: Just tell me I didn't snore.
WILLOW: (smiles) You were very discreet. Minimal drool.
BUFFY: Oh, yay.
WILLOW: So, were you dreaming?
BUFFY: Yeah, it was kind of intense...
RILEY: Intense? Really? ‘Cause you seemed so peaceful.
BUFFY: (embarrassed) Of course it was only for a moment that --
RILEY: Right. You guys headed toward Kresge?
BUFFY: Student center.
RILEY: Great. So this dream.
WILLOW: You know, you guys go, I'm gonna do the thing. (to Buffy) I'll see you after the Wicca group.
BUFFY: ‘kay
RILEY: Bye..
RILEY: Well, did I appear at all in this dream?
BUFFY: (smiling) There may have been a cameo...
RILEY: Is that right?
BUFFY: A featured role, actually.
RILEY: Romantic lead?
BUFFY: I'm not saying any more.
RILEY: So what have you got going on tonight?
BUFFY: Patrolling.
RILEY: Patrolling?
BUFFY: (quick cover) Uh, petroleum.
RILEY: Petroleum.
BUFFY: Uh huh.
RILEY: Tonight you have crude oil.
BUFFY: And homework. What about you?
RILEY: Oh, you know, grading papers...
BUFFY: Well, that'll be fun.
RILEY: Not "petroleum" fun, but it passes the time...
BUFFY: So I'll...
RILEY: I guess I won't see you till...
BUFFY: Yeah...
RILEY: Papers?
BUFFY: Grading what papers? There's just the final coming up.
RILEY: Oh. Yeah. No, some late.... papers.
BUFFY: Oh. Okay, neat.
RILEY: Right. So.
BUFFY: Class.
RILEY: I'll see you then.
BUFFY: Fortune favors the brave...
GILES: "Can't even shout, can't even cry... the Gentlemen are coming by... "It sounds vaguely familiar -- you're sure you never heard this as a child? (listens) All right... and the girl was holding a box. Nothing else? (listens) Well, it certainly could be one of your prophecy dreams, or it could just be the eternal mystery that is your brain. I'll check it out, let you know if I come up with anything. B'bye.
SPIKE: Group a what?
GILES: The Gentlemen.
SPIKE: Don't know ‘em.
GILES: You're certain?
SPIKE: No. We're out of Weetabix.
GILES: We're out of Weetabix because you ate it all. Again.
SPIKE: Get some more.
GILES: I thought vampires were supposed to eat blood.
SPIKE: Yeah, well sometimes I like to crumble up the Weetabix in the blood. Gives it a little texture.
GILES: Well, since the picture you've just painted means I will never touch food of any kind again, I'm afraid you'll have to pick it up yourself.
SPIKE: Sissy.
XANDER: I don't get where this is coming from.
ANYA: Well, what am I supposed to think?
XANDER: How can you say I'm "using you?"
ANYA: You don't care about what I think, you don't ask about my day...
XANDER: You really did turn into a real girl, didn't you?
ANYA: See? And you make jokes during my pain. You don't care about me at all.
XANDER: I care about you.
ANYA: How much?
XANDER: Well, I... we, you know, we spend... we'll talk about it later.
ANYA: I think we should talk about it now!
GILES: Thank you for knocking --
XANDER: If you don't know how I feel --
ANYA: I don't! This isn't a relationship. You don't need me! All you care about is lots of orgasms!
XANDER: Okay, remember when we talked about private conversations? How they're less private when they're in front of my friends?
SPIKE: (to Xander) Oh, we're not your friends. (to Anya) Go on.
GILES: Please don't.
ANYA: This is important.
GILES: But why is it <b>here</b>?
XANDER: Mom said you wanted me to swing by.
GILES: Oh. Yes, well I meant after sundown. I need you to take Spike for a few days.
XANDER: What?
SPIKE: What?
ANYA: What?
SPIKE: I'm not staying with him!
GILES: I have a friend coming to town. I'd like us to be alone.
ANYA: Oh. You mean an orgasm friend.
GILES: Yes, that's exactly the most appalling thing you could have said.
SPIKE: Worse than the blood in the weetabix?
XANDER: He's not roaming around. If he stays with me he gets tied up again.
ANYA: What about us? Our romantic evening?
SPIKE: I'm not having these two shag while I'm tied to a chair three feet away.
XANDER: That's not exactly one of my fantasies either.
ANYA: So you're blowing off our evening. Because you don't care about me.
XANDER: I don't want him to come over! Talk to the Brit.
SPIKE: He better have cable ‘cause I'm not missing Passions...
NICOLE: We come together, the Daughters of Gaia, sisters to the moon. We walk with the darkness, the wolf is at our side. Through the water fall of power, to the blackest heart of Eternity. (opens her eyes) I think we should have a bake sale.
CHERYL: I don't know...
NICOLE: You guys like a bake sale, right? We need money for the dance recital. And you know I do an empowering lemon bundt.
CHERYL: The most important thing is the Gaia Newsletter. We need to get the message of blessing out to the sisters. Also, who left their scented candles dripping all over my womyn-power shrine?
WILLOW: Well, this is good, this is all fun... a bake sale, some baked goods there... But there's also other stuff... that we might show interest in... as a wicca group...
NICOLE: Like what?
WILLOW: Well, there's the wacky notion of spells...
CHERYL: Well you missed last week, we did a healing chant for Chloe's ankle, she said the swelling went right down.
NICOLE: What is she doing on a mountain bike anyway?
CHERYL: She was trying to impress Justin.
WILLOW: I was actually talking more about real spells. You know: conjuring, transmutation...
CHERYL: Oh yea, and then we can all get on our broomsticks and ride around on our broomsticks!
NICOLE: You know, certain stereotypes are not very empowering...
TARA: I think that --
CHERYL: One person's energy can suck the power right out of the circle, no offense.
WILLOW: No, no, my energy's always very... you really don't do any spells?
TARA: Well, mmmmaybe --
CHERYL: Yeah? Tara? Guys, quiet. You have a suggestion?
BUFFY: So, not stellar, huh?
WILLOW: Talk! All talk: blah blah Gaia blah blah moon, menstrual lifeforce power... I thought after a few sessions we'd get into something real, but...
BUFFY: No actually witches in your witch group.
WILLOW: Buncha wannablessedbe's. It's just a fad. Nowadays every girl with a henna tattoo and a spice rack think she's a sister to the dark ones.
BUFFY: Sorry it was a bust. I know you were looking to go further in that department.
WILLOW: Well, I'd like to float something bigger than a pencil someday... Hey how's with you and Riley? You guys seemed pretty snugly after class...
BUFFY: See above, re: talk, all talk.
WILLOW: Do I have to tie you two together?
BUFFY: We almost, but...
WILLOW: Get with it! I need my vicarious lovin'!
BUFFY: I don't know -- I get nervous, and I start babbling, and he babbles -- it's a babble-fest. Plus every time we talk, I have to lie. They slayer thing comes up one way or another... it bothers me that I can't tell him the truth.
WILLOW: It didn't bother you with Parker.
BUFFY: I know. But with Riley... I wish I could just come clean.
FORREST: Well, you can't.
RILEY: I know I can't. But it bugs me this time.
RILEY: What can I say? (to another guy) -- I don't see that report on Thursday maneuvers by tomorrow you're gonna be on latrine duty and I'm talking about the sector C latrines where we keep the big ass demons and you know I mean that literally -- (to Forrest) I'm a romantic.
SPIKE: Don't see why I have to be tied up.
XANDER: It's just while I'm sleeping.
SPIKE: Like I'd bite you anyway.
XANDER: Oh, you would.
SPIKE: Not bloody likely.
XANDER: I happen to be very biteable, pal. I'm moist and delicious.
SPIKE: All right, yeah fine. You're a nummy treat.
XANDER: And don't you forget it.
SPIKE: (as Anya) Xander, don't you care about me?
XANDER: Shut up.
SPIKE: (Anya) We never talk...
XANDER: Shut up.
SPIKE: (Anya) Xander...
XANDER: Shut up.
GILES: "They need to take seven..." Take seven what?
OLIVIA: Sorry I'm so late. The flight was a horror.
GILES: Bad weather?
OLIVIA: Baseball movie.
GILES: Oh, I am sorry.
OLIVIA: Yes. That's enough small talk, don't you think?
BUFFY: (mouths) Good morning.
WILLOW: (mouths) Hey.
BUFFY: (mouths) Willow?
WILLOW: (mouths) I'm deaf! I've gone deaf!
RILEY: (mouths) What's the problem --
FORREST: (mouths) Countermeasures?
NEWSCASTER: We have this breaking news item from Sunnydale California: Apparently the entire town has been quarantined due to an epidemic of -- as strange as this may sound -- <b>laryngitis</b>. It seems the entire town has been rendered unable to speak. There is no word yet what might have caused this or what other effects might be seen from this epidemic. Local authorities have issued a statement -- a written statement, I should say -- blaming recent flu vaccinations. A few skeptics call it a city-wide hoax. In the meanwhile, Sunnydale has effectively shut down; all schools and businesses will be closed for the time being, and residents are advised to stay home and rest up. The Center for Disease Control has ordered the entire town quarantined -- no one can go in or out -- until the syndrome is identified or the symptoms disappear. We'll bring you more on that as it develops.
RILEY: (mouths) Are you okay?
BUFFY: (nods, mouths) You?
XANDER: (mouths) Boobies?
WILLOW: You were there looking for me?
TARA: (nods) I thought m-m-maybe we could do a spell... make people talk again. I'd seen you... in the group, the w-w-wicca group. You were... different than them. They didn't seem to know...
WILLOW: What they were talking about?
TARA: I think if they saw a w-w-witch they would... run away.
WILLOW: Yeah. So how long have you been practicing?
TARA: Always. I mean, since I was little... My mom used to... she had a lot of power. Like you.
WILLOW: Oh, I'm not -- I don't have much in the way of power, really, I mean most of my potions come out... soup. Also spells going awry, friends in danger -- I'm definitely nothing special.
TARA: No, you are.
WILLOW: Well, I thought we made a pretty good team -- not getting killed at all.... with some soda machine, boom! Pretty cool. Seems like you're kinda powerful.
TARA: I'd like to be. I feel like I'm stuck. Like I'm at the door and it won't open.
WILLOW: I know exactly what you mean.
GILES: So would you say this was your best visit ever?
OLIVIA: All that time you used to talk about witchcraft and darkness and the like... I just thought you were pretentious.
GILES: Oh, I was. But I was also right.
OLIVIA: So everything you told me was true.
GILES: Well, no, I wasn't actually one of the original members of Pink Floyd. But the monster stuff, yes.
OLIVIA: Scary.
GILES: Too scary?
OLIVIA: I don't know.
RILEY: Hi.
BUFFY: Hi.
RILEY: Well. I guess we have to talk.
BUFFY: I guess we do.
