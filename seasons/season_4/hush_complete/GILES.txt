"Can't even shout, can't even cry... the Gentlemen are coming by... "It sounds vaguely familiar -- you're sure you never heard this as a child? (listens) All right... and the girl was holding a box.

I'll check it out, let you know if I come up with anything. B'bye.
The Gentlemen.
You're certain?
We're out of Weetabix because you ate it all. Again.
I thought vampires were supposed to eat blood.
Well, since the picture you've just painted means I will never touch food of any kind again, I'm afraid you'll have to pick it up yourself.
Thank you for knocking --
Please don't.
But why is it <b>here</b>?
Oh. Yes, well I meant after sundown. I need you to take Spike for a few days.
I have a friend coming to town. I'd like us to be alone.
Yes, that's exactly the most appalling thing you could have said.
"They need to take seven..." Take seven what?
Bad weather?

Oh, I was. But I was also right.
Well, no, I wasn't actually one of the original members of Pink Floyd. But the monster stuff, yes.
Too scary?
