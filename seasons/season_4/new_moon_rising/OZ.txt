Hey.
Pretty much now.
Yeah, sorry.
Thanks, but I'll pass.
I'll come by your place.
It's good to see you guys. Really.
Hey.
Actually, I want you to come out. I want to show you something.
It's real. (then) Look up.
Look at the sky.
Full moon.
It's a long story -
Willow -
Will. I went through a lot of changes  while we were apart.
And I want to hear everything. I want  to tell you everything. (then) But there's something, before all that.  I talked to Xander - and he said you  didn't have a new guy.
I know what I put you through. And I'm not going to push... But  I'm a different person than when  I left. I can be what you need  now. And that's what I want. That's why I'm here.
A woman in Tibet traded it to me for a Radiohead CD. I got a lot  of mileage out of the barter system.
It's where I stayed the longest. This warlock in Romania sent me  to the monks there, to learn some  meditation techniques. It was intense.  All about keeping your inner cool.
There's more. I take some herbs and  stuff, some chanting, couple charms.
That doesn't mean you haven't gone through a lot.
I'm serious. (off her silence) But if you don't want to talk about it...
Thanks for that.
Almost eight. We talked all night.
Or we could sleep for a while.
Breakfast it is then.
Are you looking for Willow? 'Cause  she's just down in the bathroom.
I saw you at Giles' yesterday.
You sure you don't want to come in?
Your friend came by. The blonde girl? But she wouldn't stay.
Willow?
(smiles) Pretty much. I'm feeling oddly motivated.
I hope so.
Is that Willow's?
You smell like her. She's all over you, you know that?
But there's something to talk about -
We talked all night and she never said anything. Nothing. I -
Where are you taking me?
Will, get back.
Don't... Please.
It broke down outside of Mexico. I traded my bass to have it fixed and garaged. (frustrated) I shouldn't have come back now. I thought I'd changed...
But I couldn't look at you. It  turns out the one thing that brings  it on, is you. Which falls under the heading of ironic in my book.
So we're safe then, 'cause you'll never do that again.
I knew.
It's - it's okay. (then) But you're happy?
Maybe safer for both of us if you don't.
It was stupid to think you'd just be waiting.
I know. (with difficulty) But now's not that time, I guess.
I think I'd better take off.
Pretty much now.
