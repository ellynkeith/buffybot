Except the weird thing is we've been  busy at the Initiative. Our squads are  pulling a lot more captures; we've got  demons coming out of our ears.
So - I was missing something this afternoon, wasn't I? I mean, breakups  are tough - but when Oz walked in -  it seemed like emotions were running  extra high.
(cutting her off) Hold that thought. 
Speak for yourself. (into walkie) Base, this is Agent Finn. We have an HST down. Please send a  retrieval team down to Sector 72.
All of them? So what am I supposed  to do with -
Oz and Willow.
I remember.
(surprised) Whoa. Back up there. Werewolf?
Oz is a werewolf and Willow was  <u>dating</u> him?
Man. You're kidding me.
That's a big "besides," Buffy. Gotta say. I'm surprised. I didn't think  Willow was that kind of girl.
Into dangerous guys. She seems  smarter than that.
Whoah! How did we get to bigot? I'm just saying it's a little weird to  date anyone that tries to eat you  once a month.
We're not talking about you - 
Morning.
(still going) No. I do them because it's a good way to start the day.
Okay. I've been up less than a  minute and somehow, I've managed  to piss you off.
(gets up) I am spontaneous. I was going  to do jumping jacks...
No... Come on. Is this about that whole  Willow thing last night?
Look, I only said what I said because  I'm concerned. I don't want her to  get hurt.
Something wrong with that theorem?
Evil.
Name one.
Yeah. Come in.
Bad?
Graham.
(bitterly) Does it matter?
(hard) So we'll take it back and make an I.D.  If it is, we'll put him down.
What's the hold up? I thought Graham gave you a full description.
And how long's that going to take?
I don't need a bunch of tests to know  this thing's a killer. So why don't  you back off -
(cutting him off) He's coming to. Oz?
(angered) Why? The guy's not a threat now.
That's enough! This guy's a student.  I know him!
Come on.
To Giles and Buffy. They'll know how to help you.
Permission to speak, Colonel.
Sir, the prisoner is a - 
How did you-
Buffy, I leave now, I can't ever come back.
You gonna start killing people?
You and me trained together from  day one, Forrest. But I always  outranked you. Come after me,  you're gonna find out why.
No sir - I'm an anarchist.
This will work. Certainly off the beaten path.
It's better. Besides, I think it's mostly  me the Initiative wants now.
We'll be safe for tonight at least. The campus is still blacked out, which ought to slow the Initiative down. I'll  figure out my next move tomorrow.
Could be worse. At least I've got a  hotty girlfriend to keep me warm  on the lam.
Seriously? I don't know. I'm sorry it  had to end that way. But I'm glad it's  done. I'm glad to know where I stand, finally. (then) I was wrong about Oz. I <u>was</u> being  a bigot. 
Still, I was in a totally black and  white space. People versus monsters.  Ain't like that. Especially when it  comes to love.
You can tell me anything.
