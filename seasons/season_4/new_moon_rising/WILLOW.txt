More of a dog person, myself. But  I'm not like "Death to all cats!" Why? 
Can you have one in the dorms?
That would be cool. You mean it'd be sort of like a familiar?
And we could make kitty go bonkers with string and cat nip and stuff?
Fun. I'm in.
Nope.
Me too.
I'm not sure. Probably just your garden variety disaster.
(to Tara/helpfully) She means that there's been less  bad guy activity.
(to Tara again) When things get slow it's usually  because something extra evil is brewing.
(once again, to Tara) That's a metaphor - 
I'm over-helping, aren't I?
Oz...
(to Oz) When - When did you get back?
Tea? Now? With... Oz?
I - I guess so.
Okay.
What? I - no...
Tara - wait. 
But -
Hey.
(a little puzzled) Oh... Okay.
Oz. This is all so weird. I feel like  this isn't really happening. Like it's  a dream or something...
What?
Full moon...
(growing excited) Full moon! But how? I mean - you did it! How did you do it? Where did you go?
Oh my God! Oz!
This is... I mean, it's wonderful for you.
Yeah...I know the feeling.
(awkwardly) No. No - new guy.
(re: sari) I love this.
So Tibet was your favorite?
(teasing) Good. 'Cause you were such a spaz before. (then) So that's it? You keep your cool and no more wolf?
It's incredible. You've been all over  the world. You've had this complete mind/body transformation... And I've  just been - here. Same old Sunnydale.
That's true. I passed poly-sci.
Well, some of it, you know, was me telling myself I hated you and cursing your name. (quickly) Not literally.
(nods/then) And...I don't know...I think I'm  getting better with my spells and  stuff. I have a friend, we kind of  help each other...
I used to tell people we did that  sometimes, but nobody believed  you knew that many words.  (then) I believe a manly-sized breakfast is in order, don't you?
I think... I'll have the less confusing  waffles right now.
Just let me freshen up. O.J. without  the yummy toothpaste flavor just  isn't the same.
What?
Hey. You okay?
I was with him all night.
Yep.
No kink. He didn't change, Buffy. He said he was going to find a cure,  and he did. In Tibet. 
No - there's "woo" <u>and</u> "hoo". But  there's also - "uh oh". And "why now?" And... it's complicated.
It's complicated - because of Tara.
She is. And there's something between us... I wasn't looking for it, you know. It's just totally  powerful. And it's totally different  than what Oz and I had.
How come you keep saying my name like that?
Are you freaked?
I was going to tell him... But then we  hung out and I could feel everything  coming back. He's Oz, you know.
(pained) I don't want to hurt anybody, Buffy.  I think of either of them and I can't  stand it. 
Hi.
I can only stay a minute, I have class.
I just wanted to let you know, what  you saw this morning, it wasn't -
We just talked. Nothing happened.
(nods) But, you know, it was intense. Just  talking. We have a lot to talk about. (then) I kind of feel like my head's going  to explode.
(alarmed) Of course we'll be friends. That's not  even a question.
How can you, when I'm not even sure? I mean, I know what he <u>meant</u> to me. But he left. And everything changed. I changed. And then we...
It's not okay. I mean, Tara, the time we spend together is...
I don't know. It's just - life was  starting to get so good again, and  you're a big part of that. And here  comes the thing I wanted most of all. (a little desperate) And I don't know what to do. I  want to know. But I don't. 
What's up? Are you okay?
(alarmed) What? It's day time...
Oh, God... Are you alright?
When? Just now?
I have to go. I have to find Buffy.
Tara said they took him right before  she found me.
So what do we do?
He said he was controlling it with  herbs and some kind of meditation... (guiltily) What if he got upset and lost control of himself? Could the wolf come out during the day?
(angered) The deal is, he's my - (catches herself) He was my boyfriend and none of this is his fault. (to Buffy) I'm going with you.
Giles can do it without me. I can't  just sit here.
You do sort of look like an evil olive...
Oz...
(re: van) This thing looks pretty good considering you drove it overseas.
You have changed. You stopped the wolf from coming out - I saw it. 
It was my fault. I upset you.
When you spoke to Tara...
I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted was -
(realizes) I am. I can't explain it-
I missed you, Oz. I wrote you so many letters - but I didn't have  any place to send them, you know? I couldn't live like that.
I was waiting. I feel like some part of me will always be waiting for you. Like, if I'm old and blue-haired and I turn a corner in Istanbul and there you are - I won't be surprised. Because you're there with me - you know?
No. (then) What are you going to do?
When?
No candles? Well I brought one -- it's extra flamey.
I am.
I mean.
I feel horrible about everything I put you through. I'm gonna make it up, too. Starting right now.
