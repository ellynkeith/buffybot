Do you like cats?
'Cause I was thinking about getting one.
No. But this would be a sneaky cat. 
Actually, I was thinking it'd be  sort of like a pet. You know - we could name her Trixie or... Miss Kitty Fantastico or something.
Absolutely.
So - you're not allergic or anything?
Good. 'Cause I want my room to be Willow-friendly.
So I'm excited about the Scoobie meeting. . . I think. What's it about?
Got it. Thanks.
Oz?
I just... I realized... I'm late for  study group.
It's okay. Y-you should be with your  friends. And I should go.
Bye.
Oh... Sorry. I'll come back.
N-no... That's okay.
Yeah. Sometimes Willow takes me with her to the S-scoobies...
Hi.
Me too. I have class too.
(cutting her off) It's okay. I always knew, if he  came back -
Oh. Really?
Whatever, you know, happens? I'll still be here. I mean, I'll still be your  friend.
But I'm saying, I know what Oz means to you...
It's okay.
What?
Do what makes you h-happy.
Hey. (notices his papers) You're coming back to school here?
That - that's great. I mean, it's  great for you and Willow, right?
Good. That's...Because, really, you two belong together. I think it's for the b-best...
I hope you'll be v-v-very -
I can't. I can't talk about th- th..
I-I have to g-g-g-
B-b-back demon... In the-the name of Th-th-
(nods) Where are you... what's going on?
You don't understand. That's a p-p-p-
Oz.. We were talking and he - he changed. Right in front of me.
I know, but it happened.
I'm fine. Riley and the commando guys - they stopped him, but they don't know it's Oz. I tried to tell them, but they took him away.
(nods) I think they might hurt him. 
I know.
I understand. You have to be with the person you l-love.
You mean --
Oh yes.
(softly) Right now?
