You're sure you'll be all right.
Cause I could be there in the morning --
No…
I don't think I <u>could</u> sleep.
Oh my god the place is packed. Everybody's here. (to Will, excited) Your whole family is in the front row -- and they look really angry!
(to Will) Your costume is perfect. (conspiratorially) No one is ever gonna know the truth. You know, about you.
Ooh, you're already in character. I should have done that.
But what else could I expect from a bunch of low rent, no account hoodlums like you -- hoodlums! Yes. I mean you and your friends, your whole sex, throw 'em all in the sea for all I care, throw 'em in and wait for the bubbles. Men, with your groping and spitting, all groin no brain three billion of ya passin' around the same worn out urge. Men. With your… <b>sales</b>.
Willow!
Come on.
Stay low.
What did it look like?
Well you must have done something…
Play's long over. What are you still doing in costume?
Willow, everybody already knows. Take it off.
Oh, for God's sake just take it OFF.
That's better.
Well, that's a little more realistic.
Bunch of massacring.
You want some corn?
New car smell.
Big faker.
You don't need any help, right?
You sure it's us you were looking for?
Like a shark.
I'm okay. It's not coming for <b>me</b> yet.
I'm way ahead of you, big brother.
I can fight anything, right?
(amused) You don't think it's a little old fashioned?
Come on! Come on!
We're gonna miss all the good stuff!
Ooh! Here! Can I? Can I?
I'm not really in charge of these things…
(turning onto her back) I need my beauty sleep, okay, so stop --
Faith and I just made that bed…
I thought you were here to tell me. The guys aren't here, are they? We were gonna hang out, watch movies.
No, I… I think they need me to find them.
It's so late…
I'm never gonna use those.
I gotta find the others.
Have you seen my friends anywhere? (looking around) They wouldn't just disappear; they're my very good friends.
Mom?
Mom, why are you living in the walls?
It looks dirty.
I think they're in trouble-danger…
I really don't think you should live in there.
Riley! You're back!
How did the debriefing go?
Why didn't you come and tell me? We could have celebrated.
World domination. Is that a good?
We're not demons.
(to Adam) What was yours?
No wait… I have weapons…
(whispers) I'm never gonna find them here…
You're not in my dream.
Let her speak for herself. That's what's done in polite circles.
(to the Primitive) Why do you follow me?
Where are my friends?
(calm anger) Make her <u>speak</u>.
(realizing) The Slayer.
I'm not alone.
I walk. I talk. I shop, I sneeze, I'm gonna be a fireman when the floods roll back. There's trees in the desert since you moved out, and I don't sleep on a bed of bones. Now <u>give me back my friends</u>.
That's it. I'm waking up.
It's over.
Are you quite finished?
You just have to get over the whole primal power thing. You're not the source of me.
Also, in terms of hair care, you really want to say 'what kind of impression am I making in the workplace?' 'Cause that particular look --
You know, you coulda brought that up before we did it.
Yeah, but you say that about everything.
Yeah, I just… I think I might jump in the shower.
Yeah. I guess… the first Slayer. I never really thought about… it was just intense. I guess you guys got a taste of that, huh?
Yeah, well at least you all didn't dream about that guy with the cheese…
