Dinner is served! My very own recipe.
Actually, I pushed 'defrost.' But Joyce was there in the clinch.
Let the vidfest begin!
Well, we got plenty of vid. And I'm putting in a preemptive bid for <u>Apocalypse Now</u>. Heh?
So, whatchya been doing? Doing spells? (to Oz) She does spells with Tara.
(sheepish) Sometimes I think about two women doing a spell… and then I do a spell by myself.
(to the ceiling) Oh, who <b>CARES</b>….?
I'm awake! I'm good. Did I miss anything?
(staring, puzzled, at the screen) No, no… it gets better… I remember that it gets better…
Butter flavor?
Cool.
What's her deal?
Well, thanks for making me have to pee.
I got a system.
Hey, Joyce. Mrs. Summers.
We're not making too much noise down there, are we?
Oh. I should probably catch up.
I move pretty fast. You know, a man's always after…
I'm a conquistador.
I'm a comfortador, also.
That's cool about you.
Um, yeah. I'd like you. I'm just going to the bathroom first.
Okay. I'm gonna find another bathroom.
(calling out) I didn't order any vampires…
That's not the way out…
That's not the way out…
Hey. There you are.
Well, that's good. I was into that for a while, but I got other stuff going on.
Gotta have something. Gotta be always moving forward.
A shark with feet. And much less… fins.
Buffy, are you sure you want to play there? Pretty big sandbox.
I just mean… You can't protect yourself from… some stuff.
Brother?
North. To the mountains. The highest peak, the one they call "100 percent scary plummeting death." The test of a man.
No.
Is that right?
I don't know…
Yeah, but, isn't vengeance kind of… depressing?
Not a vengeance hobby, no. It's dangerous. People can't just do anything they want. Society has rules, and borders, and an endzone. It doesn't matter if…
Do you mind? I'm talking to my demon.
(bravado) Oh, I'm goin' places.
Is that right?
I don't have to…
I know what's up there!
Giles!
What's after me?
What we did?
What? Go where? I don't understand.
Honey, I don't -- I can't hear you…
Well, wait. Where are we going?
Hey! Let go! Hey!
Well, the basement, mostly.
Possibly.
You know, I never got the chance to tell you how glad I was you were eaten by a snake.
Well, I'm supposed to meet Tara and Willow… and possibly Buffy's mom…
Not 'sent' so much as 'manhandled', but… no.
No, I'm in my prime. This is primetime.
I'm a comfortador.
I'm getting a cramp…
Buffy?
(whispers) That's not the way out…
I'm sorry…
You don't understand…
Got the sucking chest wound swinging… I promised Anya I'd be there for her big night. Now I'll probably be pushing up daisies in the sense of being in the ground underneath them and fertilizing the soil with my decomposition.
Don't get linear on me now, man…
Not big with the socialization.
Yes? What, Joyce -- dyeh, Buffy's mom?
Yes. Sure. Buffy's mom.
Yeah, from now on, you keep your slayer friends out of my dreams, is that clear?
