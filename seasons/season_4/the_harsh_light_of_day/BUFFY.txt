Oh I hate that. I'm always like, what?  Did something scary come in?  Do I have to kill it?
(disinterested) Yeah?
Blue.  (caught) He's, uh, reflected in that mirror.
Not all week. We've hung out.  Moderately incessantly. But we're  not here together, and I don't want  to crowd him.
No I'm not.
I'm not? Oh, I so am.
Well, sure. (realizing) Yeah. I really feel like I am, like I'm  over... everything else. High school stuff.
Guess I was kinda silly, not planning ahead...
Absolutely.
Hobbies?
Well, mostly I... you know, hang out  and do stuff.
What's what?
Oh. Right. Angry puppy.
Please, they're the best kind.
Oh, Parker. God, I'm sorry, I didn't  mean to bring up something like that.  Bad, bad Buffy.
I think about that sometimes. A lot,  actually. How fast it could end?  See, I sort of, drowned once, a couple  of years ago. And I came back. Obviously.
Yeah, well, pool safety, important.  Anyway, I don't put things off anymore.  Like you were saying.
Also a valid life choice.
So, when you go to bed tonight, what  are you going to regret not doing today?
Yes.
Xander will be so happy.
This is it. My door. It's wood. Maybe  some kind of wood veneer.
(frustrated) Different?
Neck! Paler. Puppy! The angry puppy!
(to Parker) I should take care of this.
(really meaning it) I can't wait.
Harmony's a vampire? She must be  dying without a reflection.
Oh, Willow, I'm sorry. It's not funny.  That must have been terrible.
Boyfriend?
Guy dating Harmony -- dead? Must be  like the most tolerant guy in the world.
(shouted back) Better. No old Romans.
(shouted) Let's have a meaningful talk instead.
I think you two should go.
And you, with Harmony. Lose a bet?
(to Parker) I'll be right back!
Dru dump you again?
Yeah, Spike. With Harmony, if you  can believe it. I mean, I thought Spike  and Dru were a forever kind of deal,  didn't you? Where's the commitment?
So anyway, I couldn't figure out why  he ran away, but Harmony said something.  What they're here for. The Gem of  something... Amarra. He's waiting 'til  he gets it--
Yeah. What's up?
Well Spike seems to think it exists.  And he's looking in Sunnydale.
And I'm with you. Myth tracking. I mean,  I don't really need a full eight hours, right?  A little shaky, but that's okay...
Uh-huh. Sleepy. Yawn. Bye.
Parker. I wasn't sure I'd find you.
I am so sorry. I-- the English guy, he's  an old... friend. And the thing is, he's,  he's not supposed to drink. And I saw  him here, you know, land of the beer...
No. No, we didn't.
And what do I do? Stand here and watch?
History. Compelling places. Fascinating dates.
I never thought of it like that. history  always seemed like just, stuff that happened.
It doesn't feel like it. To me, a lot of  the time, it feels like stuff's just coming  at me, you know, and I'm reacting as  fast as I can, just trying to keep going.  Just-- just trying to be on my feet  before the next thing hits.
It really is.
Mmm.
Making a choice.
Parker?
You're here.
I didn't know where you were.
Yeah, but, breath mints, I wouldn't  be turning 'em down.
Well, if you think <u>this</u> is attractive,  wait 'till you see me with the stomach flu.
Oh, gosh. I didn't know. Look, I'll just  clear out of here. But maybe later, we  could, you know, talk and stuff?
That's great. And, before I go...
I was thinking pants. But a kiss is  good too.
Giles! Hi! I... I didn't know you were here.
(to Giles) I was. Studying. At the library. All night. (realizing the flaw) All Saturday night. Okay, you know what?  I'm an adult. It's none of your business  where I was.
You guys find that crypt. I'll track down  Spike, stop him before he gets there.
Yeah, it happened.
It was nice. Really nice. He's going  to call.
I don't know-- (smiling, admitting it) Yeah, I guess I do.
Parker?
(hurt) Parker, what's going on?
She's a friend of yours?
Well, you, sort of, didn't call. I mean,  I understand if you've been busy or  sick or something.
Well, is... is everything... okay?
It is?
Oh. So, do you maybe want to go  do something?
Parker? Did I...
Did I do something-- something wrong?
I-- You had fun. Is that all it was?
It seemed like you... liked me?
I just thought, you know...
I-- I didn't mean-- I'm sorry.
Parker, wait. I did this all wrong.
The gem.
I'm okay. How 'bout you? Sun in  your eyes?
You're a pig Spike.
Really? Let's see.
We don't destroy it.
Thanks, Oz.
He should have this.
So what I'm wondering is, does this  always happen? Sleep with a guy and  he goes all evil?
I don't know, Will. Bad luck just happens.  I made this happen.
It was safe. It's not that. It's that the  whole time, I kept thinking, hey, look  at me with someone who isn't Angel.  Look how much I'm not hung up on  Angel anymore. Look how this is not  <u>all</u> about Angel. God, how come I  didn't see it?
(sentimental) Parker said it was okay to make mistakes.  It was sweet.
I know. He's manipulative and shallow  and why doesn't he want me? If there  was something totally repulsive about  me, you'd tell me, right?
Maybe me and Parker could still work  it out. Do you think we could still work  it out?
You go on up. I'm gonna walk.
How come it's never easy?
