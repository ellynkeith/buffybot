You're Jonathan Levinson. Oh my God. My name is Karen and I think you're... you're wonderful. Oh my god.
Yeah. Please. I didn't wanna bother you... It's Karen with a 'K'.
(called after) Thank you! So much! Thanks!
Hello Jonathan. I don't know if you remember me-- Hi. Sorry about coming to your house like this--. Hello. It's Karen. Remember me?
(frustrated) Where are you at, anyway? Are you like, never at home?
It was ugly. Big ugly. All bent over sort of, with these huge arms, and, and, like scabs and stuff.
Oh! I forgot! It had a mark.
On its forehead. Like a symbol.
