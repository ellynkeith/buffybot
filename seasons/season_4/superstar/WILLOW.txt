Buffy! Another one!
Buffy!
I don't care if it is an orgy of death. There's still such a thing as a napkin.
Jonathan, I'm in. Schematics for the crypt. Part of the original plan for the cemetery. Sometimes there's a-- (disappointed) No back way in. Just the one entrance.
Oh. Of course. Why didn't I think of that?
(helpfully) We knocked 'em deader.
Next thing I know, this crazed vamp's like, running right at me. And I know if it gets past me, there's no telling who's in danger next--
I was trying for a kind of stoic bravery. But, yeah. I mean it was very exciting, with the ceiling coming in and everything.
She was great. Twang-poof. (off Tara's look) That was the sound. Crossbow, vampire dust. I mean, she was a little cranky she missed that one vamp --
Oh. Well, yeah. I know she's not over the thing with Riley sleeping with Faith. You know what I mean-- Faith's insides, in Buffy's outsides, when her insides were out.
I'm sure it'll blow over. They're probably all with the smoochies right now.
Good thing. Finding new boyfriends for her is exhausting. I don't know if I've got another one in me.
I'm glad you're okay. Everyone in the Bronze was pretty freaked out after you all left.
All the weapons are at Giles', it won't take long--
Did you just go no go?
Oh. Cool.
Um, Buffy, this is Jonathan. You know he doesn't get scared. You talked about it when you gave him the Class Protector Award at the Prom.
Okay.
So. I saw you and Riley, with the dancing.
(upset) She's going to be okay, but she's terrified.
Someone found her in the janitor's closet about an hour ago. I think she was there all night. All alone.
Buffy? Jonathan said we were safe! Jonathan said it.
He doesn't make mistakes. Remember the SATs? He got a perfect score and then he recreated the original proof of Fermat's last theorem in the margins around the answer bubbles!
This is the meeting?
On purpose?
Oh!
The other kind of oh. That's it. That's what Tara drew.
Me too. And that whole alternate universe thing was just freaky.
They work, Riley. But they take concentration, being attuned with the forces of the universe...
Guys, this is weird. I'm not sure we should be doing this. Jonathan trusts us. We shouldn't be checking up on him.
(gravely) Hey. I found the mark. It's part of an Augmentation spell. Jonathan did an Augmentation spell.
Him. And how we see him. This spell turns the sorcerer into a, into a sort of paragon. The best of everything, everyone's ideal. But there's a drawback.
(trying it out) Buffy was right. Buffy was right.
I'm scared. Everything's going to change.
Can Buffy do it? Giles, can she do it?
I can't believe we believed it.
