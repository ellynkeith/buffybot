You know why not. Those Initiative men make me… not comfortable. (then) And you don't care!
Oh. So you don't think I'm desirable  enough to be flirted with, is that it?
You don't find me attractive anymore.
Oh, really? Then why didn't we have sex last night?
Oh of course we are. You've obviously grown tired of me. I've seen it happen to thousands of women over the centuries. I  just never thought it would happen to me.
I don't understand - I'm pretty. I'm young… Why didn't you take advantage of me? Is something wrong with your body?
There must be. I saw that wrinkled man on TV talking about erectile dysfunction -
Spike. What are you doing? You made me yell really high.
I'm not paying you for scaring me.
Oh. Well that's just ludicrous. You can't hurt me because you've got a chip in your brain. Also, I like my money the way it is when it's mine.
Does that really work? Scaring people into giving you their money?
I'm beginning to understand why you're so friendless.
A year and half ago I could've eviscerated him with my thoughts.  Now I can barely hurt his feelings. Things used to be so much simpler.
Yeah. Now everything's so complicated.
Of course it did. It always does. I've seen thousands of relationships. First there's the love and sex. Then there's nothing left but the vengeance. That's how it works.
I don't know… I just can't. You can go do Dru though.
Initiative soldiers. They live here. The experiments happen in the lab under  the house. That's where they kept you and put in your chip. Let's have fun.
(to Spike) It's not very convincing is it?
Xander, stop!
We didn't have sex, if that's what you  mean. That's all I do now, not have sex.
Yes. It's part of the normal ending of a relationship right before the  vengeance begins.
Relax. I'm not going to do it. I'm just trying to tell you that we have nothing in common aside from both liking your penis. And now I don't even have that. So I get to say when it's done and it's done.
You're leaving me?
Where are you going?
Then I'm staying too. To… to show you how much I'm not bothered by you having fun. Because… because I'll be having <u>more</u> fun.
(called after, more angry) Me too. Whoo-hoo!
Why?
So? She's the slayer, he's a big soldier boy. What do they need you for?
Xander, let's get out of here.
Oh…
His voice is pleasant.
No. They're prob'ly dead.
You… didn't mean muddy-dirty?
What about the bathtub? Something happened there.
I don't get it. I mean, those kids were tortured. But they weren't killed, so where are the ghosts coming from?
But one ran right through me-
Both of which were totally pent-up during Mrs. Holt's reign of repression.
What good are weapons against disembodied spirits, Xander?  They've got no ass to kick.
Upset. Afraid of being without you. And a little hungry.
Oh. Still haunted.
Let's go. (beat) You first.
Or the human battery conks out.
Xander!
Shut up! Repressed crybabies.
Come on…
Okay.
True. (to Riley) Feel shame.
