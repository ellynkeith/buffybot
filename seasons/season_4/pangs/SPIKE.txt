But, baby... This is where I belong.
You don't mean that.
See? I knew you'd end up welcoming me with open... (he caresses her legs) ...arms.
You had that in our bed?! Do you know how dangerous that is?
You wouldn't do it.
All right! I'll go, just...
Can I have someone to eat?
Help me...
What part of "help me" did you not understand?
Come on! I'm parboiling out here!
Invite me in!
Dammit! Look, I'm safe, I can't bite anyone! Willow! Tell them what I did.
Yes, bad, but let's skip that part and get to the part where I couldn't  bite you!
Yeah, well it looks like they've done me for good.
I'm saying Spike had a little trip to the vet and now he doesn't chase the other puppies anymore. I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.
I got information. About those soldier boys you were fighting. I got the inside scoop.
Come on... what have you got to be afraid of?
Bloody hell, woman! You're cutting off my circulation.
Well it pinches.
I came to you in friendship! Well, all right, seething hatred but I've got useful information and I feel I'm being mistreated.
I'm too hungry to remember everything.
I wouldn't say no to a brandy...
Just a small brandy...
Oh, someone put a stake in me!
I just can't take this mamby-pamby boo-hooing over the bloody Indians!
You won! All right? You came in and you killed them and you took their land. That's what  conquering nations do! That's what Caesar did, he's not going around saying "I came, I conquered, I felt really bad about it"! The history of the world is not people making friends. You had better weapons, you massacred them, end of story!
Listen to you! How are you gonna fight anybody with that attitude?
Yeah, good luck.
You exterminated his race. What could you possibly say that would make him feel better? It's kill or be killed here. Take your bloody pick.
Oh leave that one. He looks like he's ready to drop any minute, and I think I can eat someone if they're already dead.
Hey, when do I get fed?
Do you know what happens to a vampire that doesn't get to feed?
Living skeletons, mate. Like famine pictures from those dusty countries, only not half as funny.
You know what else has blood in it? Blood!
Hey! Watch the heart!
Yes, let's talk about it some more...
Hey, remember that "never apologize" thing? Forget it. Apologize.
Fine. I'll do it. (called, to Hus) Hey! Sorry! Sorry about that, Chief!
Aargh! Bloody hell!
You made a bear!
Undo it! Undo it!
Oof.
(from the floor) What happened? Did we win?
Yeah, that's the fun!
Oh, lay off. You've all had a fine meal, but me... an entire siege, you'd think one of you would bleed a little...
