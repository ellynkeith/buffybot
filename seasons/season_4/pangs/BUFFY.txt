Looking for me?
Look who's home.
And they say one person can't make a difference.
You mean Dean Guerrero, or his wife?
Oh. Right. Very manly. Not at all Village People.
We have a counter point?
Okay, for some of that you were channeling your mom, right?
Yeah, I guess so. I never thought about it that way. With Mom at Aunt Pauline's this year, I'm not getting a Thanksgiving. Maybe it's just as well.
It's not really a one of those.
There he is.
Imaginary Xander is quite the machine.
Uh-huh.
No. Sorry. A lost Mission? I mean, a hairbrush, I can understand, and by the way I will find that and give it back, but how do you lose a Mission?
Mostly? I've found sewers full of demons.
Post-midterm frenzy.
It's not fair. They all get a family holiday just 'cause they can be with their families.
You know what I should do? I should have my own Thanksgiving. Invite all you guys, cook the whole meal just like Mom always does. It'll be great!
It's a sham, but it's a sham with yams. A yam sham.
I know. It's just, I want it. It's like Professor Walsh was saying about sense memory. I smell a roasting turkey and I'm eight again. I liked having that to look forward to.
Everything's all different now.
I bet Giles doesn't have any plans... And Xander usually flees most of his family gatherings...
I don't know... She and Xander seem pretty tight lately.
Anyway, Pilgrims aside, isn't that the point of Thanksgiving? I mean, you know: Everyone's got a place to go?
Never get used to this. One day she's at the Friendship Ceremony, the next day she's on the news.
That's one fun little hobby you've got there.
So... she viciously stabbed herself to death, dumped the knife, then she cut off her own ear.
It's okay. Hey, look. Something's missing from this case.
(reading) Early eighteen-hundreds. Chumash knife. There's a picture.
...I mean, it was more like a riot than a Ralph's. I though I was going to have to put some Slayer moves on this one lady who was completely hoarding the pumpkin pie filling.
Oh. Well, the knife was some kind of Indian artifact. Chumash. That's all we've got.
Guy had a big ol' scissors right there. The knife was picked out  for a reason. Don't you even own a turkey pan?
Giles, if you want to get by in American society you have to learn our traditions. You're the patriarch. You have to host the festivities or it's all meaningless.
How 'bout that ceremonial knife, huh? Pretty juicy piece of clueage, don't you think?
Thanks. I got a few more things to pick up. I'll check in. And keep your hands off the food.
That was the whipped cream in the  canister. You know... (imitates aerosol whipped cream sound) It's only right if you whip it  yourself.
I swear, this'll be the last thing. Anyway, I have an appointment to go see this priest Giles called me about. He thinks he might have some information--
Hi. I didn't see you at all. Where'd you come from?
...it'll be just like it was when I was a kid. Only without me building a fort out of my mashed potatoes.
Hey, you know what? If you're around, you know, and you don't have anywhere to go... Well, you should come. I'm a great cook. In theory. I mean, I've eaten a lot.
(disappointed) Iowa. That's one of the ones in the middle.
That sounds wonderful.
Exactly. If I knew who that was.
Ah. Well, have fun at the homestead.
"-- they have to take you in." That's what they say.
Hello? Father Gabriel?
Father? Are you out here?
God...
You're very wrong about that.
(calm but truly pissed) They tell you start an ear collection?
Well it's plenty uncommon for me to freeze up during a fight. I had the guy, I was ready for the  takedown and I stopped! And "Native American".
We don't say Indian.
The thing is, I like my evil like my men: evil. You know, straight up, black hat, tie you to the railroad tracks, soon my electro ray will destroy metropolis BAD. Not all mixed up with guilt and the destruction of an indigenous culture.
(re: potatoes) We need to boil those and then put them through a ricer.
You don't have a ricer? What do you mean? How could somebody not have a ricer?
I don't know. What's a ricer?
Yes. And I want to stop this guy. I just wish there was a non slayee way to do it.
Hey! Peas?
These are frozen.
You said you were gonna get fresh ones.
Peas. You know, in the little pods... you were gonna shell them.
They're gonna be mushy.
Yeah, well, you're why there had to be pilgrims in the first place. (to Will) What happened to the Chumash?
Boy, the Cultural Partnership center really didn't stress any of that stuff.
So Hus wasn't kidding with that "rightful vengeance" routine. He's recreating all the wrongs that were done his people.
Yeah but after dinner, right?
(meekly helpful) Well, maybe we could do that --
You know --
I have to baste.
That's good.
You didn't bring rolls?
I think they connect.
(to Willow) Didn't you say the Chumash got all diseased, holed up in the mission?
As soon as what? We still don't know what we're gonna do.
Giles, the sarcasm accomplishes nothing.
That's for the stuffing.
Well, that's sort of the question before the court.
This is no good.
(a little sheepish) It needs more condensed milk.
Over bickering and confusion? I'll take pie.
And we will have a nice dinner. Okay? Both. End of story. I'm having a Thanksgiving. It's going to be perfect.
The part where I help you.
You want me to make it quicker?
So you haven't murdered anybody lately. Let's be best pals!
You don't have any circulation.
Get used to it. I got more important things to worry about.
So tell me everything you know.
Then sit.
Uh, half a stick. And a quarter cup of brandy. (to Giles) You have brandy, right?
(to Giles) What's wrong?
(thinking) The Dean. Dean Guerrero, he's the king of us -- and he was at the ceremony...
Will, isn't there anything in there about how to stop a Native American spirit guy? Some nice, non judgemental way to, you know, kill him?
Will, what choice do we have?
-- kill a lot of people?
Will, you know how bad I feel. This is eating me up -- (to Anya, who holds up the bottle of brandy) -- a quarter cup, and let it simmer -- (to Willow, as Anya goes back) -- but even though it's hard, we have to end this. Yes, he's been wronged, and I personally would be ready to apologize...
Well, I think the Spaniards actually did a lot of... not that I don't like Spaniards...
I just want to have Thanksgiving.
All right. Whatever happens, someone should go warn the Dean.
Not alone.
You sure you're up to it?
His house is up past the gym. And  guys... hurry. Dinner's in an hour.
Later. (to Giles) I hope the others are okay...
Giles, plates.
You can have gravy. Gravy has blood in it, right?
You want me to gag you? 'Cause I'm not listening to you whine all the way through dinner. We're gonna have a nice, quiet, civilized...
Who was that?
Where's your weapons chest?
Shut up, Spike.
(to Giles) How many?
Five total. Too many.
Giles! These guys! They don't die!
Your knife. It can kill you.
I didn't mean to!
(a little sad) Thanks.
It wasn't exactly a perfect Thanksgiving.
Well. I guess that much is true. My first Thanksgiving on my own and we all got through it.
And they say romance is dead. Or maybe they just wish it.
