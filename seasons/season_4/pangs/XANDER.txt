Ow. (then, calling up) I'm okay! I'm... okay...
I'm going now. Just, kind of, tough getting going today.
Is the floor all swirly?
Then, yeah. I might have something.
Anya!
I don't really feel that bad.
(muffled) Okay, I'll stay. But you should go. You could catch it.
You're a strange girlfriend.
Um... there's a chance I'm delirious.
Happy Thanksgiving...
The doctor couldn't figure out what was up with me. Said I had a lot of symptoms that didn't  connect.
What, to this Chumash spirit vengeance guy?
Various? As in...
Well, you just recited the mystical panic-causing incantation so little hope there. Tell me about the various.
Syphilis?
Can we come rocketing back to the part about me and my new syphilis?
Sweetie... not helping.
Oh God.
I hate this guy.
I didn't give him syphilis!
So he rises up and infects the  first guy he sees? That's not fair.
So let's take this guy out! Buffy: It is for to be slaying sometime soon, yeah?
Question?
To slaying him? Well, the representative from syphilis votes "yea".
He's a vengeance demon! You don't  talk to vengeance demons, you kill them!
What? I didn't mean -- you're an EX-vengeance demon, it's totally different...
Anya...
You know I didn't mean you...
You got a lot of volunteers in  here...
Maybe it's the syphilis talking, but some of that made sense.
Me too.
(heading out) I'm up to it.
Well, that was a waste of time.
Maybe Anya shouldn't have opened the conversation with "Everybody got both ears?"
So what do we do now?
Angel!
Buffy.
How can we --
Get away from them!
Hey!
Hey! Gentle Ben! Over here!
(to the bear) That's for giving me syphilis!
Nobody asked you.
I don't know. It kinda seemed right to me. A bunch of  anticipation, a big fight and now we're all sleepy.
And you know what? (romantically, to Anya) I think my syphilis is clearing right up.
Yeah. Especially with Angel here and everything.
