Buffy! Honey, how are you?
How's college? Have you been  fighting?
As long as you're being careful... I  didn't think you'd show here for a  while.
Uh, well, yeah... I really didn't think  you'd be back for a couple of weeks...  I didn't move anything of yours, it's  still your room.
But I didn't move anything...
It's just for a couple of weeks while  we do inventory at the gallery. I really  didn't think you'd be coming back so  soon...
