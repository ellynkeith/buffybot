The point of this course is not to  critique popular American culture, it  is not to pick at it or look down upon  it. And it is not to watch videos for credit.
The point is to examine its structures,  its schemata and recurrent themes and  there are two people talking at once.  I know that one of them is me.
The other is a blond girl. You.  Blond girl. Stand up.
Getting off to kind of a slow start.
(holds up attendance sheet) If your name isn't on this sheet then  you are wasting everyone's time. Are  you on the sheet?
Do you understand? You are sucking  energy from everyone in this room.  You are taking their time, their energy.  They came here to learn. Get out.
Leave! Thank you.
