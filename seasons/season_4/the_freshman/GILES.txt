Buffy! Hello.
No, uh, forgive me. This is Olivia.  Old friend, stopping over for a few  days.
(to Olivia) Buffy is a... was a student of mine.  And how is University?
Ah. Help. Yes.
So, trouble with your, uh, studies?
You keep saying that.
I'm not supposed to have a private life?
Well, before I succumb to the ravages  of age, why don't you tell me what  brings you here.
Yes?
You suspect vampire activity?
And?
I'm still not sure where I come in.  You haven't described anything you  can't do yourself.
Officially, you no longer have a watcher.  Buffy, you know I will always be here  when you need me. Your safety is more  important to me than anything. But  you are going to have to look after  yourself. You're out of school now  and I can't always be there to guide  you.
Buffy --  BUFFY No. You're right. I can deal. I was  just... yeah. I'm on it. Thanks.
I'm here if you need me.
Yes.
I'm not sure.
Buffy!
Buffy, I've been up all night. I know  I'm supposed to teach you self-reliance,  but I'm not leaving you out there to  fight alone. The hell with what's right!  I'm ready to back you up. Let's find  that evil and fight it together.
The evil is this way?
