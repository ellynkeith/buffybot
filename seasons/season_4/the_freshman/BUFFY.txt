Anything?
Introduction to the Modern Novel.  I'm guess I'd probably have to <b>read</b>  the modern novel.
I like books, I just don't wanna take  on too much. Do they have an  Introduction to the Modern Blurb?
That's good.
Maybe I shouldn't take Psych.
How do you get renowned? Do you  have to be nowned first?
For credit?
How did I miss that one?
Sorry, Miss "I chose my major in  playgroup."
I've been busy, you know? It's been  a slay-heavy summer. I haven't had a  lot of time to think about life at UC  Sunnydale.
Yeah. Gonna be an adjustment...
Giles says I have to be secret identity  gal again. If too many people know  I'm the slayer, I'm a target blah blah  blah...
Gonna be tough. With a roommate...
I'm psyched for college, definitely.  I'm just wondering how it's gonna  work with my extracurricular activities.  I gotta make sure it doesn't take the  edge off my slaying. Gotta stay sharp.
Okay. Right.
Well you know I meant to, and then  I was busy all day...
Right. Do you know where Wiesman  Hall is?
Hey, Will! Boy am I glad to see you.
Yeah!... Almost, one might say, <b>too</b> much...
(re: leaflets) I see you got ticketed too.
(holding up the last one) Jello shots.
Are we headed anywhere near  Wiesman? I need to get my I.D. Card.
Well, I hope that I learn from this, and that I grow.
No, it's nice that you're all excited.
I get it, though, I do. I'm all for spurty  knowledge, really, I just... it's a little  overwhelming, you know? Don't you  feel that?
Gee, I forgot to pick mine up. That  line's probably really long now too.
(jumps on it) Oh, isn't it overwhelming? I was saying  that - aren't you just completely disoriented?
It's too bad Giles couldn't be librarian  here. Be convenient.
Gentleman of Leisure. Isn't that just  British for "unemployed?"
Speaking of slack, have you heard  anything from Xander?
Did you explain about Hawaii?
I hope he gets back soon. It'd be fun  to get the gang together, you know,  hanging out in the... library...
It's... cozy...
It's, yeah... it'll be great if we ever  need a place for... the Nuremberg rallies...
Thanks.
Here.
Got it!
I'm so, I just... the books were too high,  and then everything was bad.
Uh-huh. I mean the first one.
I'm nice to meet.
Yeah, 'cause... you know, everyone's  got a brain...
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.
So. It's a pretty nice room.
Uh, yeah, but if you wanted to be  on the right...
Painfully.
I know. Me too.
Did he say if this course is full yet?
Well, I...
I just didn't know if the class was still  open, if we could still sign up...
No, but -- I was told that --
I didn't mean... to suck...
Oh. Thanks.
Yesterday... in the store... You  don't remember.
(crestfallen) Yeah.
Buffy.
Um, I'm just wondering - Professor  Walsh isn't planning to yell at me  and kick me out of her class, is she?
Great.
Oh!
No, I'm sorry. Wasn't looking.
No, no, I'm just heading to Fischer  Hall, it's right... uh, I know it's... on  the Earth planet, I'm sure of that... (fessing up) Recently voted Most Pathetic, uh huh.
Ooh! I come in second.
Okay, here's Fischer Hall...
Are we the blue part?
Yes. Okay, I came from here, so, we  go... that way.
Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna try. She's not  afraid of the long words, is she?
I'm a little upset. I had it on good  authority this was a party school.
Yeah, I still feel like carrying around  a security blanket.
(never heard of it) No, I'm not big on... porn... I mean  I've cut way back.
Oh. I don't really have one - unless  you count Mr. Pointy.
Hey, bike path!
I'll look for you in Psych.
Cool.
Yeah...
Thanks, Mom...
Giles?
You're not Giles either -- unless he  had a much more interesting week  than I did.
Is this a bad time?
Uh huh...
Kind of like high school. In the sense  of that I sort of need help.
But this looks like a bad time.
It's a bad time.
Well, it looks pretty bad! I think someone  has just a little too much free time on  their hands.
No, because you're very very old and  it's gross.
There's a student missing.
Eddie. He's supposed to have left  school, but I don't think he did. I met  him outside last night -- I went back  there and right near where I saw him  there was a struggle.
That was my first thought. Actually,  that was my only thought.
What do you mean, "and"? And we  need to stop them! Eddie's R.A. said  kids disappear a lot. There could be a  group of vampires working the campus.  We need research, and charts and stuff.
Okay, remember before you became  Hugh Hefner, when you were a watcher?
Oh. Okay. I'm sorry to bug you.
How am I supposed to hunt in this  mob? Don't you people have homes?
Eddie, wait up! God, I was worried  something had happened to you and  yes of course did because you're a vampire.
You will be.
And you are...
You know, that threat gets more  frightening every time I hear it.
Everyone gets to play...
I thought people in college were  supposed to get smarter.
Mom?
I'm okay...
They started it.
Well, I didn't have classes today, and  everything is so hectic, I just thought  it'd be nice to come home and crash for  a few...
You've filled it with packing crates.
If it's still my room, shouldn't I be  able to fit in it?
Neither did I.
Hello?
Xander!
When did you get back?
You freak of nature! Why didn't you call?
I missed you. How was your trip? Is  America nice? I hear it's nice.
What'd you do? What'd you see?
Come on, tell!
(admiringly) You saw the Grand Canyon...
(a little confused) Oh.
Male strippers?
Okay. College is great.
No, really. Willow's in heaven -- Oz  got this great off-campus house with  the band...
It's just... it's this vampire. She took  me down, and I'm not sure how to  stop her.
I don't want to bug them... just starting  school, they don't need this...
I don't know, I just... what if I can't cut it.
Slaying... everything.
Well, thanks for the dada-ist pep  talk. I feel much more abstract.
Yeah, sure, in high school I was Buffy...
Yes, I'm Betty Louise Plotnik of  Blue Falls Missouri. Or I might  as well be.
Can that be one of those things you  never ever tell me about?
I think I say thank you.
Kids disappearing every year. Not  too many. Just enough so everyone  believes they up and left.
Well, they have to be keeping it  somewhere. On campus or real near by.
Seems like they weren't too common  till like '82.
Psi-Theta loses its charter, building to  be closed for renovation.
Looks pretty cherry...
You mean where we all a paint and  sculpt and stuff like that?
It's been a long week. Let's go  look at the house.
Score.
Oh. OH! That's my skirt. You'll never  fit in that with those hips!
I don't see my trunk down there. It  was under my bed. If they missed it -  Mr. Gordo! Get your filthy -- ooh!  Okay. Go to my room. If my weapons  trunk isn't there, try Willow's. I'll  keep an eye on these -- my diary...  that's so unfair...
Laugh all you want. This time, we  play it my way, and the rules are  just a little bit --
Ooh.
Just thought I'd drop in... get it?  Drop in?? Boy. Tough room.
You've got a nice setup here. (ominous) But you made one mistake.
(dropping the act) Well, I'm not actually positive yet,  but statistically speaking, people  usually make at least --
You don't want to touch that.
You wanna know the truth?
When you look back at this, in the  three seconds it takes to turn to dust,  I think you'll find the mistake was  touching my stuff.
Let me answer that question with a  headbutt.
No thanks...
Great. Thanks. We'll get right on that.
My room is.
It's turning out to be a lot like high  school. Which I can handle. You  know, at least I know what to expect.
