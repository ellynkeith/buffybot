BUFFY: (looking at Mariah CD) Wow. This music is so... She's...  wearing a really little skirt.
KATHY: I know - this song is super fun, isn't it?
BUFFY: (a little tightly) You bet. It just gets fun-er and fun-er  every time you play it.
KATHY: Going out?
BUFFY: Yeah. I'm seriously caffeine deprived.  Figured I'd go study at the Grotto and  get a jolt.
KATHY: It's late. Won't you be up all night?
BUFFY: That's cool. I'm kind of an "up" sort  of... night person. I mentioned that, right?
KATHY: I guess I didn't realize you'd be  coming and going at all hours. (quickly) Not that I mind. I'm just surprised.
BUFFY: I'll be quiet as a mouse. Promise.
KATHY: Oh. Say, Buffy?
BUFFY: (not thrilled) Goody. A system.
KATHY: Just log every call you make in here.  That way when the bill comes there  won't be a problem. I figure - a  stitch in time...
BUFFY: Catches the worm. You bet.  (heads for the door) So, see you...
KATHY: (stops her again) Also? I noticed that some of my milk  was missing. Did you...
BUFFY: (embarrassed) Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry. I meant to-
KATHY: (quickly) No. It's totally okay. I was just  wondering.
BUFFY: I was having my coffee and-
KATHY: Buffy, it's fine. I just wanted to  make sure-
BUFFY: (genuinely puzzled) Like who - Sid the wily diary gnome?
KATHY: I don't know. It's not a big deal.  Please, feel free.
BUFFY: Okay, well. Sorry again. (then) I'd better...
KATHY: (overly chipper) Great! Have a good time.
BUFFY: (also too nice) And you too. With the studying.
WILLOW: So you had trouble getting past Kathy?
BUFFY: Yep. She made big with the questions.
WILLOW: And you thought your days of sneaking  out of your room were over.
BUFFY: No such luck. Kathy's nice and  everything but she's like - I don't  know - Mini-Mom of Momdonia.  (stops/then) Did you hear something?
WILLOW: I'm chewing my gum kinda loud.
BUFFY: That's not it.
WILLOW: My sneakers are squeaky.
BUFFY: (impatient) I'm looking for something lurky  here, Will.
WILLOW: Oh. Sorry. No.
BUFFY: Darn. I could use a little play tonight.  Listening to the best of VH1 all day  sorta put me on the edge.
WILLOW: (sympathetic) Kathy's still spinning the Divas?
BUFFY: 'Cause it's so <u>fun</u>.
WILLOW: Yeah. The dorm thing is just an  adjustment we have to make. (casually) I mean, my roomie's kind of...  challenging too.
BUFFY: And what are we - if not women up  to a challenge?
WILLOW: Exactly. Did we not put the Grrrr in girl?
BUFFY: Say hey to Oz for me.
WILLOW: I will. And, acting as his main squeeze,  I extend a "hey" right back at ya on his  behalf... Happy hunting.
BUFFY: Thanks. Wish me monsters.
BUFFY: Will?
KATHY: Hey, I caught you...
BUFFY: Everything okay?
KATHY: Everything's super. I just decided a  decaf latte sounded like heaven after all.
BUFFY: Oh. So. You're... coming along.
KATHY: Why not? This way you don't have to  walk these spooky paths alone.
BUFFY: Great. That's great.
KATHY: This is neat, isn't it? The fresh air,  the trees, the-
BUFFY: It was... He... tried to take my backpack.
KATHY: (puzzled) What were you thinking - taking  him on like that?
BUFFY: I don't know. I panicked, I guess.
KATHY: It's just, you could have gotten hurt  or something. And look at my sweater -  it's ruined.
BUFFY: Yeah. Sorry about that. (then) Come on, let's get you cleaned up.
ONE: (demon-speak) Mil sty'ga dir rach ulam.
ONE: (demon-speak) Mil sty'ga dir rach ulam.
ONE: (subtitled) She may be the one.
TWO: (demon-speak) Gol v'ruq ga toka. Ach'va mil.
TWO: (subtitled) We have to be sure. Follow her.
ONE: (demon-speak) P'uvaq a-gol
ONE: (subtitled) As you wish.
BUFFY: (to herself) Boring bill, bill, bill...
GILES: And jump. And bend. And,  occasionally, frolic.
BUFFY: Okay... And what's with Motorbike  and Scooter magazine?
GILES: Congratulations. You've found me out -  I'm a mod jogger.
BUFFY: You're not doing the mid-life thing,  are you? Cause I'm still going "ick"  from the last time you recaptured  your youth-
GILES: Buffy-
BUFFY: Sorry... Demon. Last night. Made  with the pummeling. Got away.
GILES: What sort of demon?
BUFFY: He was wearing a cloak. Glowy red eyes.  And his skin looked like he had a super  bad rub-on tan.
GILES: Translate?
BUFFY: Orange-y.
GILES: Thank you. Anything else?
BUFFY: My roomie Kathy was there - but she  didn't see anything.
GILES: You took her patrolling with you?
BUFFY: Well - I invited the whole dorm, but  she was the only one who could make it. (off his look) She thought I was going for coffee.  Decided to tag along.
GILES: Right. Best to discourage her of  that habit.  (then) From what you describe, I'm not familiar  with this creature. I'll look into it and  give you a ring as soon as I have something.
BUFFY: So... It's nice out here.
GILES: Yes. I take my tea here sometimes.
BUFFY: Hum. And what are you up to today?
GILES: I've quite a big day, actually. A friend  of mine recently acquired an original  Guttenberg demonography and it  suddenly occurs to me that you've  never once asked me what my day's  plans were, which leads me to inquire  if you're feeling entirely yourself?
BUFFY: What? That's not true. I ask about  you all the time. (off his look) Well - maybe the words don't actually  make it out of my head - but I think  about asking.
GILES: Which I appreciate. But it still doesn't  answer why you're hanging about  instead of rushing off as usual.
BUFFY: No big. I just want to hang here until  my roommate goes to class.
GILES: Ahh. I see.
BUFFY: I know. It's probably just me - having  a bitch attack. (quickly/defensive) But it's not. Me. I mean, she's make  anybody nuts. She has her outfits  written up on index cards and she  gives them names like "Easter at  the White House." I find that deeply,  deeply disturbed - don't you?
GILES: Buffy. Living with someone isn't easy,  especially for an only child-
BUFFY: Listen to me. When she sharpens her  pencils - she measures them with a  ruler so they'll all be the same size.
GILES: Which is fussy, I agree. But everyone  has their idiosyncrasies - and you'd do  well to learn to tolerate them.
BUFFY: Or I'll end up an old lady who can only live with cats?
GILES: Something like that.
BUFFY: Okay. You're right. Take a mental pic:
BUFFY: Excuse me?
PARKER: The person you're hiding from.
BUFFY: Oh... Both. Ugly break up.
PARKER: Freshman, huh?  BUFFY It's that obvious?
PARKER: There are signs. For instance, people  who've been around for a while know  how to use their dining hall card.
BUFFY: It's not for food?
PARKER: Work it right and you can get three meals  worth. Which equals fewer punch cards  used annually-
BUFFY: (catching on) -and more dough from Dad you can  keep for yourself.
PARKER: Right. The goal is to polish off as much  as humanly possible in one sitting -  enough to get you through the day if  necessary - while chipmunking items  for future consumption.
BUFFY: Got it.
PARKER: Excess dry goods fit nicely in a back  pack or pocket. The wetter items,  your macaronies, your turkey loaf -  then you're into Ziplocks, it's not  for beginners.
BUFFY: I should take it slow.
PARKER: So...  Now Buffy sees WILLOW, who smiles and waves from the table she shares with Oz and Xander.
BUFFY: Oh. Those are my... Are you - ?
PARKER: I have someone waiting. Otherwise, I'd... (offers his hand) Parker Abrams. I'm at Kresge Hall.
BUFFY: Buffy Summers. Stevenson.
PARKER: Okay. Well, see you around, Buffy  Summers of Stevenson.
BUFFY: See you, Parker Abrams.
XANDER: Hey. Say hi to non-college guy.
BUFFY: Not that I mind, but don't you non-college  guys usually populate the non-campus?
XANDER: Usually. But I thought I'd come 'round  and check on my girls.
WILLOW: And eat off my tray.
BUFFY: What's the deal, Xand. Don't your  parents feed you?
XANDER: Sure they do. For a price.
WILLOW: So - spill. What was that all about?  With the cutie patootie?
BUFFY: I don't know. Nothing serious, I think.  Just random adorableness.
XANDER: A technique I know well. Hit the girl  with your best shot and then - hasta.
OZ: (nods) Gotta respect the drive by.
XANDER: Low rejection. Fond memories.
WILLOW: It looked like more than that to me.  He got all googly-eyed.
XANDER: That's cause he got hit by the Buffinator.  Now he's powerless.
BUFFY: (pleased) You think?
OZ: No question. He'll be back.
XANDER: So what else is up with the Buff?  Any vamp action?
BUFFY: No, but I got jumped by a demon of  non-specific origin the other night.
XANDER: Yeah? Something apocalypse-y? Do  we need to assemble the Scooby gang?
BUFFY: (bemused) Thanks. I think I'm okay.
XANDER: I just got way too excited, didn't I?
BUFFY: (affectionately) I think you need to get out of the  basement more often, Xand.
KATHY: (enthusiastically) Hi everybody. Squeeze in.
BUFFY: (tightly) You all know Kathy, my roomie?
KATHY: I didn't think you'd mind. I mean, you  got mine all muddy...
BUFFY: (hotly) I was saving you from a-
WILLOW: Bear!
BUFFY: Mugger.
KATHY: (sweetly) It's not a problem, is it? I mean, I figure  we're almost like sisters now - living  together and everything.
BUFFY: No. No. It's cool. I just wished  you'd asked.
BUFFY: (into phone) I mean, can you believe her? First she  acts like she has sit privileges at <u>my</u>  lunch table just because some computer  decided to make us cell mates-
BUFFY: Fine. Whatever. What about my sweater?  You can't believe the stuff I have to  put up with!
WILLOW: Yeah, I guess it's hard, but I'm sure  the sweater thing was an accident.
BUFFY: I don't know, Will. I don't think I can  stand another day of this.  (hears something) She's back from the bathroom. Later.
KATHY: (singsong) Don't forget to log those calls...
BUFFY: Gum gnome?
KATHY: It wasn't me. It had to be somebody, Buffy.
BUFFY: Huh. Don't know.
KATHY: Fine.
BUFFY: Fine.
KATHY: Do you always make that noise when  you sleep?
BUFFY: So then, after the leeches, the demon  opens my mouth and sucks some kind  of weird light out of me. But the worst  part is - I wake up and there's <u>Kathy</u>,  just looking at me like I'm some kind  of freak.
OZ: Actually - worst part? I'd have to go  with the demon pouring blood down  your throat.
WILLOW: (grossed out) Me too. I vote for that too.
BUFFY: But that was a dream and the Kathy  thing is real. All she cared about was  the fact that her precious sleep had  been disturbed-
GILES: (gently interrupting) Perhaps it would be more... productive  to examine your dreams, try to determine  their meaning-
KATHY: (to Giles) You can read dreams? Neat.
BUFFY: Kathy. Giles. Giles. Kathy.
WILLOW: He's our grown-up friend. But not  in a creepy way.
GILES: Nice to meet you, Kathy
KATHY: Ditto. (then) Maybe you can read the dream I had  last night. There was like, this monster.  And he sat on me and did all this stuff  to me-
OZ: Stuff like leeches? And a Bloody  Mary minus the Mary?
KATHY: That's it. How did you know?
OZ: I'm a good guesser.
BUFFY: (bitchy sweet) Me too. And I'm guessing you have  to be on your way to class - right, Kath?
KATHY: (ditto) Sounds like somebody woke up on the  wrong side of the bed this morning.
BUFFY: And, guess what? You were next to it.
KATHY: You know - I do have to dash. My whole  schedule is off because someone kept  me up all night. (then) Well it's been fun - toodles.
BUFFY: (grrrrrr) Toodles.
GILES: You know what this means?
BUFFY: Yeah. It wasn't enough for her to take  my sweater, now she has to horn in on  my dreams! She's the most ever mooch -  oh! And I haven't even gotten to the floss.
GILES: Buffy. Focus. Please. (then) If you and Kathy are having the same  nightmares, chances are good something  happened to you two the night you  encountered that demon in the woods.
WILLOW: So - we need to figure out if this ritual  they're dreaming about has some special  use or meaning.
BUFFY: Cool. You guys do the brain thing.  I'll go to class.
OZ: Which could be construed as a brain thing.
BUFFY: Not when you're minoring in Napping 101.
WILLOW: Okay. That was the bad twin, right?  I mean, she was almost Cordelia-esque.
OZ: She's definitely pushing the stress  meter on this Kathy thing.
GILES: I concur that Buffy doesn't seem herself.  But learning to live with someone can be  a challenge.
WILLOW: And she hasn't been sleeping.
GILES: Right then. Nothing to be concerned  about. Still, do let me know if she...
OZ: Hits the red zone?
ONE: (demon-speak) Gol ek bennum. Mil eko dir  rach ulam. 
ONE: (demon-speak) Gol ek bennum. Mil eko dir  rach ulam. 
TWO: (demon-speak) Du'wach. Ga v'ruq venga mosh  dachla rach ulam, Taparrich.
ONE: (subtitled) We were correct. She is the one. 
TWO: (subtitled) Good. I have prepared for the  summoning of the great one, Taparrich.
PARKER: (not seeing Buffy) ...lots of popular artists who don't get  their due. Madonna, Whitney...
KATHY: It's so totally true -
BUFFY: Parker?
PARKER: Hey. I just stopped by to say - that -  and bring you-
BUFFY: Plus - freezer guard. That is so-
KATHY: Parker was just going to leave his number  and go. But then we started talking and -  he is such a blast. The time just flew.
BUFFY: Time? Really? How much time?
PARKER: (innocently) I'm not sure. We sort of got caught up.  Talking Redwings; turns out Kathy's  a closet hockey fan. I think it's the violence.
KATHY: Quit it. I told you that was just between us.
PARKER: (also laughing) It could be the sweaty men...
BUFFY: If you guys are gonna rassle, you wanna  do it outside? I've got work to do.
PARKER: Sorry. I didn't realize.
BUFFY: Look. I didn't mean to sound so-
PARKER: No. It's totally cool. I should go anyway.
BUFFY: It was great of you to come by.  And another time...
PARKER: Another time for sure.  (to Kathy) Bye Kathy.
KATHY: Bye. See you.
BUFFY: Looked like you were being nice  enough for the both of us.
KATHY: I wasn't moving in on your territory,  if that's what you mean.
BUFFY: Right. Just like you didn't destroy  my cardigan.
KATHY: I'm cold.
BUFFY: Well I'm hot. Deal with it.
KATHY: You know what your problem is, Buffy?
BUFFY: You?
KATHY: Hardly. Your problem is - you're spoiled.  Maybe the world revolved around you  where you used to live but it's share  time now!
BUFFY: Share time. It's share time? Fine. I'll  show you <u>share time</u>.
BUFFY: So then she's like - "It's share time!"  And I'm like - "Oh yea? Share this!"
OZ: So, you either hit her - or you did your  wacky mime routine for her.
BUFFY: (deflating) I didn't do either, actually. But she  deserved it, don't you think?
OZ: Nobody deserves mime, Buffy.
BUFFY: Kathy does. She should be locked in an  invisible box and blown away by an  imaginary wind and, and...
OZ: Forced to wear a binding unitard.
BUFFY: Yes! The itchy kind. Perfect.
OZ: Just here to help.
BUFFY: Which I appreciate. But you've never  come out on routine patrol with me  before. What's the deal?
OZ: Seemed more interesting than homework.
BUFFY: As long as it's an elective. I can handle  myself alone, you know.
OZ: Not in question.
BUFFY: Good. (back to Kathy stuff) So then - I go to the refrigerator where  the label queen has -
OZ: Just one thing - do you think the ranting  may be scaring off potential demons?
BUFFY: You're right.
OZ: On the plus side - you killed the bench.  Which was looking shifty.
BUFFY: This isn't funny, Oz. Something has  to be done.
OZ: Agreed.
BUFFY: That's it. I'm going to sleep.
KATHY: (sweetly insincere) Sweet dreams.
KATHY: ...I do what I can but Buffy's difficult.  She's secretive, for one thing. She comes  and goes at all hours of the night. She  leaves her <u>gum</u> all over the place-
WILLOW: (uncomfortable) Sounds like things are rough. But -  don't you want to be talking to Buffy  about this?
KATHY: I would, but she's so touchy. About all  kinds of weird stuff. I mean, sometimes  I get the feeling she's not quiet... normal.  You know?
WILLOW: (sweating now) Well, normal is... relative, right?
KATHY: Later - okay?
BUFFY: Why were you talking to her?
WILLOW: Buffy, come on. We were just saying hi.
BUFFY: That's just what she wants you to think -
WILLOW: Buffy. This has to stop. I mean, I get it -  I have a sucky roomie too. But you  have to deal.
BUFFY: You're right. I've been thinking a lot  about it. It's clear to me now.
WILLOW: Good. That's better.
BUFFY: Kathy's evil. I'm an evil fighter. It's  simple. I have to kill her.
WILLOW: Don't you think you could just... switch  rooms or something?
BUFFY: I would, but it's not just me in danger  from Kathy. Look.
WILLOW: Toenails.
BUFFY: <u>Evil</u> toenails. I collected them off the  floor when she was in the bathroom  last night. She thought I was asleep.
WILLOW: Good thinking. 'Cause, in the middle  of the night, those toenails could have  attacked you and left little half moon  marks all over your body.
BUFFY: Don't be ridiculous. The point is - I  measured them before I feel asleep and  again this morning. And they grew,  <u>after</u> they were cut. A lot. That's a  demon thing. That's heavily creature- from-elsewhere if you ask me. She  has to be eliminated.
WILLOW: (playing along now) Of course. It all makes sense now.  But you'd better show those bad puppies  to Giles before you do anything. Just to  be sure.
BUFFY: Oh, absolutely. I don't want to do  anything crazy.
WILLOW: Good. You hurry on to Giles' - and I'll  hang in there and keep an eye on Kathy.
BUFFY: Great. Good. Thanks Will.
BUFFY: Giles? Anybody? Hello, it's-
XANDER: Sorry Buffy, this hurts me more than  it hurts you.
BUFFY: Not yet - but it will.
XANDER: (hurt) Don't say that. (terrified) Please don't say that...
GILES: We're only doing this to stop you from  making a terrible mistake, Buffy.  Clearly something's amiss-
BUFFY: Yeah, something's amiss: A Miss  Kathy Newman! Look! In my pocket!
GILES: I fear this demon Buffy met in the woods  may have possessed her somehow.
BUFFY: (rabidly) She has to be destroyed! Lite FM!  Love songs! Nothing but love songs!
XANDER: (to Giles) You think?
GILES: You stay and watch her. I know a spell  which will make the possessing demon  reveal itself so we can fight it - but I  need supplies from the majik shop. (as he goes) Buffy, I... see you around.
WILLOW: Can I come in?
KATHY: Sure. Where's Buffy?
WILLOW: I don't know, exactly. But I've been  thinking - it might be a good idea for  you and Buffy to give each other some...  apart time. In fact, you might want to  be, uh, apart before she gets back.
KATHY: (displeased) What do you mean? I should leave  the room? Why should I go?
WILLOW: It's not fair, I know, but-
KATHY: (cutting her off) You bet it's not fair. Having to live  with someone who's obviously troubled.  Someone who so clearly needs to be  in a home, not a dorm-
WILLOW: I don't know about that. Buffy's going  through something - yes. But-
KATHY: I wouldn't put it past her to drop out  or take off or something. Do something  horrible to herself.
WILLOW: Herself?
KATHY: Or worse. She's capable of it, you know.  You can see it in those shifty little eyes  of hers. One of these days she might  even push somebody too far...
WILLOW: (into phone) You did... She's at Giles'? Okay.
BUFFY: I can not believe this! After all we've  been through together, you won't listen  when I tell you that Kathy is bad!
XANDER: We want to, Buff. It's just-
OZ: (interrupting him) Don't engage. I'm pretty sure the next  part is about fava beans and nice Chianti.
BUFFY: I heard you!
XANDER: I don't know if I tightened those  ropes enough.
OZ: Then we'd better go over there and  check them.
XANDER: (it sinks in) Oh dear God.
BUFFY: Nope. Not tight enough.
BUFFY: Kathy.
KATHY: Buffy...
BUFFY: I think we need to "talk" - don't you?
KATHY: Absolutely. Let's "talk."
BUFFY: (provoking) Oopy. Look what I did.
KATHY: Look what I did.
BUFFY: I KNEW IT!!
KATHY: Quit it!
BUFFY: I knew you were one of them. One of  those demon things.
KATHY: I'm not. Those guys are after me-
BUFFY: Funny. I'm seeing the skin, the eyes...
KATHY: So, I'm from the same dimension. But  I'm not like them. They're disgusting-
BUFFY: What - they don't live by the Kathy "system?"
KATHY: You know - why don't you just stuff it  and let me finish my ritual-
BUFFY: Ritual?
KATHY: (duh) Your nightmares.
BUFFY: (gets it) Were real.
KATHY: (exasperated) Look, I'm sorry, okay? I left my  dimension to go to college and they  sent these guys after me. They don't  know what shape I took as a human,  but they can always sense a creature  without a soul, which I don't have.  So I'm borrowing yours...
BUFFY: Without even asking!
KATHY: Tonight when they come looking for  me - they'll take you.
BUFFY: Thank God. I won't have to watch  you floss anymore.
KATHY: (fuming) And I won't have to live with a slob-
BUFFY: Fine. Let's start with my sweater!
XANDER: Why couldn't Giles have shackles like  any self respecting bachelor?
WILLOW: You guys, I just saw Kathy and she's  acting really -
OZ: Yeah. But Buffy's got a pretty good  lead on us.
WILLOW: I'll call Kathy - tell her to get out of there.
KATHY: All you had to do was write- (slam) down! (slam) -your! (slam) --calls!!
WILLOW: No answer.
XANDER: Let's go.
GILES: Toenails!
WILLOW: And that's a demon thing?
GILES: Unequivocally. So I- (noticing something) Where is Buffy?
XANDER: You're saying Buffy's been doing a  Linda Blair on us because Kathy's  been sucking her soul?
GILES: That's what I believe. Yes.
WILLOW: (stunned) So Buffy was right all along. Later on,  big remorse.
GILES: Now. I found a spell that should reverse  the should transfer procedure instantly -  which Willow and I will perform immediately.
OZ: Leaving Xander and me to go help  Buffy in the flesh.
GILES: Hear me, elders of the upper reaches. Elders of the lower reaches. Elders of the dry land. Elders of the river flats!
BUFFY: (triumphantly) AH HA!!
GUY: Do you mind? People are trying to study!
GILES: Ancients I beseech you! The soul  abstracted - let it revert to its true seat -
KATHY: Window's open. Happy?
GILES: ...let the unnatural vessel be emptied.  Let the essence be return to its original host!
KATHY: How did you-
TAPARRICH: (demon-speak) Teeka a-gol. U'ku a-gol mach'taga voka mil?
TAPARRICH: (demon-speak) Teeka a-gol. U'ku a-gol mach'taga voka mil?
TAPARRICH: (subtitled) There you are. Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in young lady?
KATHY: (demon-speak) Ga nu lach'var!
KATHY: (demon-speak) Ga nu lach'var!
KATHY: (subtitled) I'm not going back!
TAPARRICH: (demon-speak) U'ku nu kal'bich t'goli
TAPARRICH: (subtitled) Don't take that tone with me.
KATHY: (demon-speak) Ga treps'mech kan! Epok or'ahah a- gol nu vach-non penul'mech?
KATHY: (subtitled) I'm 3000 years old! When are you going to stop treating me like I'm 900??!
TAPARRICH: (demon-speak) Oova a-gol mach'ruga'te. Ga nu voca kla'tu ve'rada nich'to a-gol dachla-mil.
TAPARRICH: (subtitled) When you stop acting that way. I can't tell you how much you've upset your mother.
XANDER: I only hear talking. Maybe we got  here in time.  INT. BUFFY'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
KATHY: (demon-speak) A-gol nu be-v'nook kachla!
KATHY: (demon-speak) A-gol nu be-v'nook kachla!
KATHY: (subtitled) You never let me do anything!!
TAPARRICH: (demon-speak) T'nok! A-gol ku vach-t'gach boloch.
TAPARRICH: (demon-speak) T'nok! A-gol ku vach-t'gach boloch.
TAPARRICH: (subtitled) Enough. You're coming home.
WILLOW: How's that?
BUFFY: A little to the left... There.
WILLOW: About that... The Kathy thing? I'm  sorry I doubted you.
BUFFY: You're completely forgiven. I mean,  you had reason to doubt. Except for  the soul sucking stuff - I bet Kathy  was sort of regular as far as roomies go.
WILLOW: That's a pretty big "except."
BUFFY: I guess. I'm just glad to know that it  was Kathy's demon-y ways making  me no-fun-Buffy. 'Cause I've always  thought I was pretty easy going-
WILLOW: You gonna finish this?
