(looking at Mariah CD) Wow. This music is so... She's...  wearing a really little skirt.
(a little tightly) You bet. It just gets fun-er and fun-er  every time you play it.
Yeah. I'm seriously caffeine deprived.  Figured I'd go study at the Grotto and  get a jolt.
That's cool. I'm kind of an "up" sort  of... night person. I mentioned that, right?
I'll be quiet as a mouse. Promise.
(not thrilled) Goody. A system.
Catches the worm. You bet.  (heads for the door) So, see you...
(embarrassed) Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry. I meant to-
I was having my coffee and-
(genuinely puzzled) Like who - Sid the wily diary gnome?
Okay, well. Sorry again. (then) I'd better...
(also too nice) And you too. With the studying.
Yep. She made big with the questions.
No such luck. Kathy's nice and  everything but she's like - I don't  know - Mini-Mom of Momdonia.  (stops/then) Did you hear something?
That's not it.
(impatient) I'm looking for something lurky  here, Will.
Darn. I could use a little play tonight.  Listening to the best of VH1 all day  sorta put me on the edge.
'Cause it's so <u>fun</u>.
And what are we - if not women up  to a challenge?
Say hey to Oz for me.
Thanks. Wish me monsters.
Will?
Everything okay?
Oh. So. You're... coming along.
Great. That's great.
It was... He... tried to take my backpack.
I don't know. I panicked, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry about that. (then) Come on, let's get you cleaned up.
(to herself) Boring bill, bill, bill...
Okay... And what's with Motorbike  and Scooter magazine?
You're not doing the mid-life thing,  are you? Cause I'm still going "ick"  from the last time you recaptured  your youth-
Sorry... Demon. Last night. Made  with the pummeling. Got away.
He was wearing a cloak. Glowy red eyes.  And his skin looked like he had a super  bad rub-on tan.
Orange-y.
My roomie Kathy was there - but she  didn't see anything.
Well - I invited the whole dorm, but  she was the only one who could make it. (off his look) She thought I was going for coffee.  Decided to tag along.
So... It's nice out here.
Hum. And what are you up to today?
What? That's not true. I ask about  you all the time. (off his look) Well - maybe the words don't actually  make it out of my head - but I think  about asking.
No big. I just want to hang here until  my roommate goes to class.
I know. It's probably just me - having  a bitch attack. (quickly/defensive) But it's not. Me. I mean, she's make  anybody nuts. She has her outfits  written up on index cards and she  gives them names like "Easter at  the White House." I find that deeply,  deeply disturbed - don't you?
Listen to me. When she sharpens her  pencils - she measures them with a  ruler so they'll all be the same size.
Or I'll end up an old lady who can only live with cats?
Okay. You're right. Take a mental pic:
Excuse me?
Oh... Both. Ugly break up.
It's not for food?
(catching on) -and more dough from Dad you can  keep for yourself.
Got it.
I should take it slow.
Oh. Those are my... Are you - ?
Buffy Summers. Stevenson.
See you, Parker Abrams.
Not that I mind, but don't you non-college  guys usually populate the non-campus?
What's the deal, Xand. Don't your  parents feed you?
I don't know. Nothing serious, I think.  Just random adorableness.
(pleased) You think?
No, but I got jumped by a demon of  non-specific origin the other night.
(bemused) Thanks. I think I'm okay.
(affectionately) I think you need to get out of the  basement more often, Xand.
(tightly) You all know Kathy, my roomie?
(hotly) I was saving you from a-
Mugger.
No. No. It's cool. I just wished  you'd asked.
(into phone) I mean, can you believe her? First she  acts like she has sit privileges at <u>my</u>  lunch table just because some computer  decided to make us cell mates-
Fine. Whatever. What about my sweater?  You can't believe the stuff I have to  put up with!
I don't know, Will. I don't think I can  stand another day of this.  (hears something) She's back from the bathroom. Later.
Gum gnome?
Huh. Don't know.
Fine.
So then, after the leeches, the demon  opens my mouth and sucks some kind  of weird light out of me. But the worst  part is - I wake up and there's <u>Kathy</u>,  just looking at me like I'm some kind  of freak.
But that was a dream and the Kathy  thing is real. All she cared about was  the fact that her precious sleep had  been disturbed-
Kathy. Giles. Giles. Kathy.
(bitchy sweet) Me too. And I'm guessing you have  to be on your way to class - right, Kath?
And, guess what? You were next to it.
(grrrrrr) Toodles.
Yeah. It wasn't enough for her to take  my sweater, now she has to horn in on  my dreams! She's the most ever mooch -  oh! And I haven't even gotten to the floss.
Cool. You guys do the brain thing.  I'll go to class.
Not when you're minoring in Napping 101.
Parker?
Plus - freezer guard. That is so-
Time? Really? How much time?
If you guys are gonna rassle, you wanna  do it outside? I've got work to do.
Look. I didn't mean to sound so-
It was great of you to come by.  And another time...
Looked like you were being nice  enough for the both of us.
Right. Just like you didn't destroy  my cardigan.
Well I'm hot. Deal with it.
You?
Share time. It's share time? Fine. I'll  show you <u>share time</u>.
So then she's like - "It's share time!"  And I'm like - "Oh yea? Share this!"
(deflating) I didn't do either, actually. But she  deserved it, don't you think?
Kathy does. She should be locked in an  invisible box and blown away by an  imaginary wind and, and...
Yes! The itchy kind. Perfect.
Which I appreciate. But you've never  come out on routine patrol with me  before. What's the deal?
As long as it's an elective. I can handle  myself alone, you know.
Good. (back to Kathy stuff) So then - I go to the refrigerator where  the label queen has -
You're right.
This isn't funny, Oz. Something has  to be done.
That's it. I'm going to sleep.
Why were you talking to her?
That's just what she wants you to think -
You're right. I've been thinking a lot  about it. It's clear to me now.
Kathy's evil. I'm an evil fighter. It's  simple. I have to kill her.
I would, but it's not just me in danger  from Kathy. Look.
<u>Evil</u> toenails. I collected them off the  floor when she was in the bathroom  last night. She thought I was asleep.
Don't be ridiculous. The point is - I  measured them before I feel asleep and  again this morning. And they grew,  <u>after</u> they were cut. A lot. That's a  demon thing. That's heavily creature- from-elsewhere if you ask me. She  has to be eliminated.
Oh, absolutely. I don't want to do  anything crazy.
Great. Good. Thanks Will.
Giles? Anybody? Hello, it's-
Not yet - but it will.
Yeah, something's amiss: A Miss  Kathy Newman! Look! In my pocket!
(rabidly) She has to be destroyed! Lite FM!  Love songs! Nothing but love songs!
I can not believe this! After all we've  been through together, you won't listen  when I tell you that Kathy is bad!
I heard you!
Nope. Not tight enough.
Kathy.
I think we need to "talk" - don't you?
(provoking) Oopy. Look what I did.
I KNEW IT!!
I knew you were one of them. One of  those demon things.
Funny. I'm seeing the skin, the eyes...
What - they don't live by the Kathy "system?"
Ritual?
(gets it) Were real.
Without even asking!
Thank God. I won't have to watch  you floss anymore.
Fine. Let's start with my sweater!
(triumphantly) AH HA!!
A little to the left... There.
You're completely forgiven. I mean,  you had reason to doubt. Except for  the soul sucking stuff - I bet Kathy  was sort of regular as far as roomies go.
I guess. I'm just glad to know that it  was Kathy's demon-y ways making  me no-fun-Buffy. 'Cause I've always  thought I was pretty easy going-
