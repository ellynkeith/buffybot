So you had trouble getting past Kathy?
And you thought your days of sneaking  out of your room were over.
I'm chewing my gum kinda loud.
My sneakers are squeaky.
Oh. Sorry. No.
(sympathetic) Kathy's still spinning the Divas?
Yeah. The dorm thing is just an  adjustment we have to make. (casually) I mean, my roomie's kind of...  challenging too.
Exactly. Did we not put the Grrrr in girl?
I will. And, acting as his main squeeze,  I extend a "hey" right back at ya on his  behalf... Happy hunting.
And eat off my tray.
So - spill. What was that all about?  With the cutie patootie?
It looked like more than that to me.  He got all googly-eyed.
Bear!
Yeah, I guess it's hard, but I'm sure  the sweater thing was an accident.
(grossed out) Me too. I vote for that too.
He's our grown-up friend. But not  in a creepy way.
So - we need to figure out if this ritual  they're dreaming about has some special  use or meaning.
Okay. That was the bad twin, right?  I mean, she was almost Cordelia-esque.
And she hasn't been sleeping.
(uncomfortable) Sounds like things are rough. But -  don't you want to be talking to Buffy  about this?
(sweating now) Well, normal is... relative, right?
Buffy, come on. We were just saying hi.
Buffy. This has to stop. I mean, I get it -  I have a sucky roomie too. But you  have to deal.
Good. That's better.
Don't you think you could just... switch  rooms or something?
Toenails.
Good thinking. 'Cause, in the middle  of the night, those toenails could have  attacked you and left little half moon  marks all over your body.
(playing along now) Of course. It all makes sense now.  But you'd better show those bad puppies  to Giles before you do anything. Just to  be sure.
Good. You hurry on to Giles' - and I'll  hang in there and keep an eye on Kathy.
Can I come in?
I don't know, exactly. But I've been  thinking - it might be a good idea for  you and Buffy to give each other some...  apart time. In fact, you might want to  be, uh, apart before she gets back.
It's not fair, I know, but-
I don't know about that. Buffy's going  through something - yes. But-
Herself?
(into phone) You did... She's at Giles'? Okay.
You guys, I just saw Kathy and she's  acting really -
I'll call Kathy - tell her to get out of there.
No answer.
And that's a demon thing?
(stunned) So Buffy was right all along. Later on,  big remorse.
How's that?
About that... The Kathy thing? I'm  sorry I doubted you.
That's a pretty big "except."
You gonna finish this?
