Ga! My sodden sleeping chair's bloody... sodden.
I look like a plumber to you?
Yeah. Delivering melted cheese on bread. Doing your part to keep America constipated.
I shrunk them. My bleeding shirt, trousers...
Damn things keep doing that.
That cannot be true. Don't know how you let yourself be seen in this... wanker-wear.
(petulant) Go out. Get me some decent stuff. And I want more blood.
Wish you would, if it's gonna be like this.
How you gonna stop me, you stupid sod? Property damage I can do.
(mocking) Fine. Run off to your girlfriend, then. "Oooooh. Spike's so mean to me -- boo hoo hoo..."
Goodbye Dru. See you in hell.
Bloody rot! Can't a person knock?
Fag off. It's no concern of yours.
(desperate) But you can. You know I'd drain you drier than the Sahara if I had half a chance. Besides, I'm beyond pathetic. Stuck in this basement, washing skivvies for a blighter I wouldn't have bothered to bite a few months ago-
I mean - am I even remotely scary anymore? Tell me the truth.
Please. Leave a bloke a shred, will you?
You go on. I won't do anything. I feel better now. Promise.
(heartened) Really? You're not just saying that?
(mildly hopeful) Which means I'm one step closer to melting in a sea of molten hell fire, yeah?
Adjust? And what - end up like the two of you? No thank you.
I should think you'd be glad to greet the end of days. I mean, neither one of you is making much of a go at it. (to Xander) You. Kids your age are going off to University -- you made it as far as the basement (re: Will) And Red here. You couldn't even keep dog boy happy. I mean, you can take the loser out of high school-
Am not. I just don't want pity from geeks more useless than I am.
Buffy fights the forces of evil. You're her groupies. She'd do just as well without you. Better, I'd wager - since she wouldn't have to go about saving your hides all the time.
Or - you're just the same 10th grade losers you've always been - and she's too much of a softy to cut you loose.
Look at you. I'm surprised the world hasn't ended ten times over with this sorry lot protecting it.
(petulantly) Fine by me. I hope we all go under.
Let's rock n' roll? You actually talk like that?
Right. Perfect.
No pain...
I can hurt a demon...
Yeah! That's right! I'm back and I'm a bloody animal! Yeah!!
(innocent) What? I was helping.
Me? No. No sir. I'm just - an old pal of Xander's, here.
Yeah.
What's this? Just sitting about watching the telly when there's evil afoot? Not very Industrious of you. I say we get out there and kick a little demon ass! (off their silence) Can't go without your Buffy, is that it? Too chicken? Let's find her, then. She is the chosen one after all. (more frustrated) Come on! Vampires, grrrrrrr - nasty! Let's annihilate em! For justice! And... and for the safety of puppies... and Christmas, right? Let's fight that evil! Let's kill something! Oh, come on...
