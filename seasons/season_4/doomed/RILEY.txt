What are you?
Sorry. Came out a little blunter than I intended. It's just... (enthused) You're amazing. Your speed, your strength--
(sincere) You know who I am. The rest... (uncomfortable) What I do... I can't tell you.
(offering) Hostile Sub-Terrestrials.
(with some concern) A little too well.
It is. Born and raised. And hey, bulletin, I'm not the only one who's been less than honest here.
And you fight... demons... I mean, you wailed on them -- and these guys were in shape. Kind of a weird shape, but --
But I'm a walking bruise today. See me with my clothes off I look like... I mean I have bruises... purple. Don't see a scratch on you.
I'm looking pretty hard.
So, then... What do we... do?
I am a nice, normal guy.
Yeah. I think that's a good idea.
Don't think I need to tell you...
Good. It'll be safer for all--
--concerned.
(jazzed) Wow. That was some ride,
Sorry. I'm a little excited. It's my first earthquake.
What's a slayer?
No. A girl. With powers.
Fill me in.
You're telling me she doesn't exist.
And how do you explain the things we deal with, Forrest?
Never mind.
The "animals" are rattling their cages. Been going on all day. Wonder what's got them all worked up.
Just trying to... make up my mind about something. (looks at Forrest) Buffy... She's pretty cool, isn't she.
One of ours?
No. I'll go. Do a little recon. See if it falls in our domain. You alert Prof. Walsh. Tell her we have a casualty of indeterminate nature. Let's not make a move until we get the whole story.
Wow. That flippy thing you did...
It's gone. Saw it take off toward the woods.
No weapons. No backup. You don't go after a demon that size by yourself.
Yeah, well, I'm no slayer.
(into walkie talkie) Base One, this is Lilac one...
Confirm sighting of an unidentified sub-T. Mobilize patrol team for debriefing at oh-eight-hundred hours.
Looking for you. She who hangs out in cemeteries.
Don't sweat it. We'll bag him.
Yeah, but I really think we --
Can't talk?
Again? You've dated me before?
And I'm dying to find out!
I don't understand where this is coming from. I know you like me. And it's not like we don't have anything in common.
Buffy. I'm thrown by this. I'm confused. But I can feel my skin humming -- my hands, my... every inch of me. I've never been this excited by a girl and I'm not trying to scare you, not gonna force myself on you but I am by God not gonna walk away because I think it might not work. I don't know what's happened in the past --
It's not just a job --
You don't have to be. You're not in high school anymore. You can change things.
I know it seems like --
...three meters tall, approximately one hundred to one-twenty kilograms, based on my visual analysis.
Unknown, probably nothing we haven't handled before. There's no pattern that we can discern yet -- got to assume he's on a basic 'Kill-crush-destroy.' So I want him bagged fast.
Here's one for the good guys. Thing's got a pheromone signature a mile wide. And Agent Gates's been working with a detection system the lab's developing.
We'll be going out in civvies -- day clothes only, guys. Weapons stowed in packs, keep 'em out of sight 'til nightfall. And remember... this one isn't a capture. It's a kill.
Buffy.
What? Oh-
It takes trace readings of the creature's pheromones.
It's either mating season for this thing - or it's moving all over town.
(to Buffy) Excuse me.
No. Hold up.
(laughs lightly, fondly remembering) Hey, remember that time I asked you your opinion? Gee, neither do I... (then) You and Graham move ahead. I'll catch up with you in a few minutes.
(cutting him off/hard) You'd be wise not to finish that thought, private. Now carry on.
Sorry.
Right. I'm on it too. (then/frustrated) It's just - this thing. This you and me thing? It's stupid.
No. I mean you're stupid. I mean, I don't mean that... no, I think maybe I do.
I'm serious. You've got this twisted way of looking at things. This - this doom and gloom mentality. You keep thinking like that, things are probably going to turn out just the way you expect.
Buffy -- where's the bad here? It just turns out we're even more well matched than we thought we were. I mean, you're a-
-fry cook. And so am I.
Which is exactly the attitude I'm talking about! I know the risks of what we do. I also know it's more rewarding than any other job on the planet. And fun-
I'm not saying you shouldn't take your work seriously-
But why? Why can't it be?
(cutting her off) Welcome to the story of the world! Things fall apart, Buffy. Evil - it comes and goes. But the way people manage is, they don't do it alone. They pull each other through. And, sometimes, they even enjoy themselves. If you weren't so self involved, you'd see that!
I know that it's not just the job thing. I'm sure there's some good looking guy that done you wrong in there too but mostly I think you want to stay down in the dark place. 'Cause maybe it's safer down there.
No - see - I don't think so. We have an opportunity here, you and me. And the fact that you're too scared to even give it a try-
Fair enough.
You're coming back out.
Buffy. Are you-
Well, hey! Willow. Xander, right? What are the chances, huh? I was just passing by - and I thought I heard people inside-
I am? But it's... paint ball and then the aftershock and I-
No, no, no. Commando, I mean- (evading/to Spike) Do I know you?
Oh - I - Oh. That's nice.
So - what are you guys all doing here, anyway?
Come in.
Oh, hey, sorry, I'm just. I'm a dead man. Secret. Highly. Or, it's supposed to be. Then you find out, I can deal. You're special. But last night with your friends was a disaster. I mean, could I have been less convincing? I was trained to be sneaky and stuff and I'm like - hi, paint ball, just passing by... I should have just given them my security code and rank-
No. Did I say - ? I... Oh, God... This is so not good. Everybody knows about me. I'm finished. It's the end of the world.
