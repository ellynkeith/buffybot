Rough day?
Come on Buffy, be a lonely drunk. (beat) Rough day?
Work with me here. I'm finally an essential part of your collegey life. No more "looking down on the townie" - I'm the new bartender at the pub. Got my lighter, my rag, my empathy face…
Au contraire, mon frere.
Mon girl-frere. Behold.
What gives it away?
I've seen Cocktail. I can hippy hippy shake.
Then unload 'em right here, baby. (flicks the lighter) Rough day? Wanna tell me about it? (off her look) Shutting up now.
Gets my Oscar nod.
(to Will) So, you gonna come by tonight? To the pub?
(to Buffy) How's that fugue state coming along?
<b>Nothing can defeat the penis!</b> (off their looks) Too loud, very unseemly.
That's right. 'Cause the bartender's always ready to listen.
(shouting) What? WHAT?!
Okay… (to others) You're a rum and coke, you're a Poker's Light… Vodka on the rocks and… A water? Is that right?
(to himself) Ice water - how do I make that?
Rough day?
You are so sharp.
S'alright.
(piping in, cheery) No really, it's alright. I'm due for a break.
(reconsidering) Hm, no, forget it.
I've got beer. Want some beer?
How about I see some I.D. first? 'Cause you're not getting a drop until I'm satisfied that -
Buffy?
(softly, sincerely) Rough day? (off her nod) Want to tell me about it?
Buffy…
No.
No.
Sorry. So sorry.
Don't go anywhere.
Time to go home, Buffy.
No. I've cut you off.
Out you go.
No, beer bad. Bad, bad beer. What the hell am I saying? Go home and go to bed.
Bye.
(beat) Pay up and go home, guys.
(picking through them) I'll take this one and this one. And… (beat) Man, you know, I've always had a problem calculating the tip. And you guys being so dapper of brain, maybe you could help me.
Good. Okay. See, if your bill comes to sixty dollars. And generally, people tip… what, approximately thirty percent? That would make your tip, what?
You are so smart! This is <u>so</u> the right amount!
Somebody didn't have their fiber today.
Hey, you alright in there?
Colm?
We're cool. Easy.
(yells) Help! (scared) Oh God.
Fire angry!
Jack, JACK! We got a problem. They guys, they, they're… (sudden calm) some of your patrons are turning into cave men.
What!?
Well they are now…
(frantic) Why are we talking about beer? The guys are… (realization) …the beer.
No! No neat! I served them that beer. (oh shit!) I served Buffy that beer. (calmly) Uh, how much beer would you say a person would need to consume before they started seriously questing for fire?
In a day or so, someone's gonna get killed.
You're a bad bad man.
I cut her off before the others. I don't think she had as much to drink.
I didn't know it was evil!
Well excuse me Mr. I-Spent-the-60's -in-an-electric-koolaid-funky-satan-groove.
Hey, I'm not the dad of her. Buffy's a grown up, and she's intelligent enough to -
Yeah, I think we need to track down the funboys somewhat pronto. Jack said the beer wouldn't wear off till -
(eyeing her) Giles, don't make caveslayer unhappy…
Yes, Buffy strong.
No, Buffy get -
Giles…
Which way?
Buffy!…Buffy!…
Ah hah. Can't find the beer. Good. Freshman girl not able to hold the beer, should not have it. Get into trouble.
Okay, all good, remember the boy, boy smell nice? Yeah? Any part of Buffy still in there?
Oh no.
(to the caveboys) Stay.
Are you all right?
You guys had enough fun for one night?
And was there a lesson in all this? What have we learned about beer?
Good. Just as long as we're clear.
Anyway, I think the boys are contained for the time being.
They'll figure out how to work the door locks when the effect has worn off. And they'll just think they had too much beer. Which is surely close enough.
I dunno. Wasn't locked.
