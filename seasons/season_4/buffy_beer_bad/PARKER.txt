I don't mean this in a bragging way, but I do get to know a lot of women.
But I haven't found the "one" yet.  I've yet to find a girl that I can just… you know, sit with, feeling totally at ease spewing whatever's on my mind. Or even sit with, comfortably in silence.
Willow… Can I tell you something private?
Just that I've enjoyed talking with you. Here, tonight.
What?
What?
Look, if you think -
Oh God…
Help me… I can't breathe…
Buffy, what do we do, oh God…
Buffy. I… I don't know how to say this.  I'm sorry for how I treated you before. It was wrong of me, and… I'm sorry. (beat) And, you were great tonight. Really. (beat) I may not deserve this, but… Do you think, you could… forgive me?
