You're saying Maggie set you up?
Probably not. But we'd be remiss if we didn't think through all the possibilities.
I still don't understand, Buffy. What happened that would make  Maggie want to kill you?
(gravely) Clearly. I can only imagine what she  was so desperate to hide.
Absolutely not. I will not squat in that dank little hole.
Precisely. Besides, I don't see why we can't stay right where we are. I doubt very much that those Initiative boys are going to come  around here looking for --
We think Buffy was becoming too inquisitive. That she may have been getting close to something Dr. Walsh was trying to hide. Any idea what that might be?
I've heard rumors. That The Initiative isn't what we've been told. That, secretly, they are working toward some darker  purpose... Something that might harm us all -
Must we have the noise? My head is splitting.
Yes. Can't imagine why I didn't sleep well in my beachball.
Really? I'm surprised you could hear it over your Wagnerian snoring. 
She must have set it after you.
She's right. You mustn't blame yourself.
How is he?
(back on topic) How do you plan on getting inside The Initiative, Buffy? Surely their security system is almost impenetrable.
As for the whereabouts of the Polgara demon, Buffy, I'm afraid we haven't turned up much. There's  been no report of him since his capture.
Well, if it makes you feel better, we didn't fare much better here.
He's asleep, finally, but he doesn't  look good... And the research has  been troubling as well. This demon  we're dealing with seems highly  atypical for a Polgara. The child it  killed was mutilated, and there's no  recorded case of a Polgara ever doing  such a thing.
Exactly -
You're not well, Riley. You need to rest.
No. We're still looking, but -
