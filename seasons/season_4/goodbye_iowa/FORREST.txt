Hey - where you been all night? (off his silence) Well, congratulations. I see you and Buffy have finally gotten past the shy phase.
What things?
This is mighty ominous. What's up, man?
What? (then/skeptical) Did Buffy tell you that? I mean, do you have any proof?
I don't get it. Why?
(considers/then) I wouldn't put it past Buffy to get on Professor Walsh's bad side. She tends to put her nose where it doesn't belong.
She's a pain, always wanting to know why this, and why that - 
I don't know. Maybe Professor  Walsh found out that Buffy was up to something bad. That ever cross  your mind?
It bugs me that she's using you to infiltrate our operation.
Riley, think about it! The Professor's not stupid. If she tried to kill Buffy - maybe Buffy needed killing.
What is it?
Look at that wound. She's been staked, wouldn't you say brother?
Only one person I can think of who could do something like that.
No way, man. That's your girlfriend's M.O.
Bring 'em on. That supernatural freak is blinding you and I'm sick of it!
Could be. Or a squatter of the  demon variety.
Who cares. I see a demon, it dies.
(frustrated) Damn!
(disbelieving) Right, and you just happened to be in the neighborhood.
We'll take it from here.
It's a military hospital -
Back off. We take care of our own around here, understand?
(to Graham) Escort her out.
