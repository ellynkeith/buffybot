What am I?
How do you work?
(simply) Me.
I've been thinking... About the world.  I wanted to see it. Learn it. I saw the  inside of that boy, and it was  beautiful, but it didn't tell me about  the world. It just made me feel. So  now I want to know about me. Why  I feel. What I am.
Yes. But I seem to have a design flaw.
In addition to organic material, I'm  equipped with GP2D11 infrared  detectors, 140 MWS, microspec 4000 sensors, a harmonic decelerator plus DC servo...
And man. And machine. Which tells  me what I am, but not who I am... (then) Mother wrote things down. Hard data, but also her... feelings. That's  how I learned I have... a job here.  And that she loved me.
Riley Finn...
(cutting him off/interested) Oh. Mother created you too.
A birth mother. But after you met Maggie, she was the one who shaped your basic operating system. She taught you how to think, how to  feel. She fed you chemicals to make  you stronger, your mind and body...  She said that you and I were her  favorite children, her art. That  makes us brothers... family.
That's pain, isn't it? Why? Because  your feeding schedule, the chemicals,  have been interrupted? Or do you miss  her? Tell me -
You won't. You haven't been programmed to.
It's here. The plan she had for us.  What happens. How it ends.
Do you want to hear?
Thank you. This was interesting.
