I just got your message a minute  ago - I was in class. But I was about to call you.
Yeah, that was nice.
I know that. (then/smiling) But you want to do a spell.
(gently interrupting) You don't have to explain. I don't  mind. Really. (shyly) I've been thinking about that last spell we did all day.
The Goddess Thespia? Are you sure we're ready for that?
Okay. If you say so. 
(re: square on floor) So this square is Sunnydale?
But how does it work?
Wow.
Thespia, we walk in shadow, walk in blindness. You are the protector  of the night.
