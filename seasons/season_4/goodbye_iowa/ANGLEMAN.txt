Dr. Walsh? 
Stand back, men. Show some respect.
Alright, good. Now, Washington is sending in a team to do an  internal investigation. I've been told we have to wait for  word - 
Probably. It looks like, last night,  the Polgara escaped through tunnel 72.
I'm afraid so.
My orders from Washington are for a total lock-down until they arrive. I'm sorry. (then) Now return to your quarters. There's nothing you can do here.
How many of the men are still out? The longer they go without their meds -
It's dangerous. I don't want to think  about the damage our guys could do  under the stress of withdrawal,  especially since they won't understand  what's happening to them -
But Finn wasn't one of them, right?
Find him. He's the one I care about.  He's too important to the work to lose now.
I was wondering when you'd turn up.
Somebody's coming, you know. I'm  sure they've already seen you on the security monitors -
Finn. Take this girl to the stockade,  immediately!
She did. (quickly) But understand, the Initiative has no  interest in eliminating the slayer. It  was her own vendetta -
I don't know -
It was the -- project.
It - it escaped -
She was. It's not -
Adam. Maggie would want you to stand down.
(softly) Oh God...
Doctor...
