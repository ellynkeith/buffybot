Oh, you.
What are you, keeping tabs on me? You gonna give me a hard time now?
Very funny. Well you don't have to worry about me drinking. Unless you're here to protect innocent beers.
Yeah, and as soon as I get this chip out of my head I'll be a vampire again but until then I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree so why don't you sod off and let me enjoy the lack of ambience?
Oh, fine! Throw it in my face! 'Spike's not a threat anymore, I'll just turn my back, he can't hurt me…'
Gah! You know why I really hate  you, Summers?
Wuh-yeah, that… covers a lot of it…
I get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a confrontation.
