I've been thinking. About vampires.
Your place. Yes. The sewers. You hide from them, crawl about in their filth, scavenging like rats. What do you fear?
You fear the cross. The sun. Fire.
You fear death. Being immortal, you fear it more than those to whom it comes naturally.
Demon in a human body. You're a hybrid. Natural and unnatural. You walk in both worlds, and belong to neither.
I have been blessed. I have a gift that no man has, no demon has ever had. I know why I'm here. I was created to kill. To extinguish life wherever I find it and I have accepted that responsibility. You have lived in fear and desperation because you didn't have that gift. But it's time to face your fear.
You are here to be my first. To let them know I'm coming. I am the end of all life, of all magic. I'm the war between man and demon, the war that no one can win. You're a part of that now. You have to show me that you're ready.
Then ask yourself: What is it? More than man, more than anything elseâ€¦ what is the thing that you fear?
