What's going to happen to her?
I just hope she can get some kind of help.
Of course.
Faith.
I just don't understand what could drive a person to that kind of behavior.
I'll never believe that. I think she's horribly unhappy.
Buffy!
I'm sorry…
I've missed you.
I know how it is… you have so much in your life now.
Of course. But maybe we could  spend a little time together soon.  Some night when I'm not being  held hostage by a raving psychotic.
What are you doing?
Oh. That was Giles on the other line. He wanted you to meet your friends there, said he had news.
Is that the "Harlot"?
That's the same one Faith picked.
