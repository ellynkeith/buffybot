More clothes?  HANK (guiltily) Uh, do shoes count as clothes?  JOYCE (re: large suitcase) That's shoes? How much shopping did  you let her do?  HANK Oh, I'm spoiling her. Did I forget to  mention that?  JOYCE What you forgot is that I'm gonna  have to deal with another year of  'Daddy would let me buy that.'  HANK I just thought I'd save you from the big  back-to-school clothes nightmare.  JOYCE My nightmares about Buffy and school  have nothing to do with clothes. Did she  manage to stay out of trouble in L.A.?  HANK She did, yeah. She was, you know... great.
But.  HANK She was just... I don't know. Distant.  Not brooding, or sulking, just... there  was no connection. All on the surface.  The more time we spent together, the  more I felt like she was nowhere to be  seen.  JOYCE Hence the shoes.  HANK I may have been overcompensating a little.  It was strange. At least when she was burning  stuff down I knew what to say. As for  example, 'don't burn stuff down'. But now...  JOYCE Welcome to my world. I haven't been  able to get through to her for so long...  I'll just be happy if she makes it through  the school year.
How are your new classes.  BUFFY (not looking at her) Good.  JOYCE Good.
