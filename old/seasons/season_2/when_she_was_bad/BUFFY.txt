Miss me?
Strictly R&amp;R. Hung out, partied...  shopping was also a major theme.
Why would I call Giles? I'll see him at  school.
Uh, I think you can get a little more  volume if you speak from the diaphragm.  WILLOW Sorry.
Well, I'm ready for anything those  vampires want to throw at me.  CUT TO:
Fine! I'm fine!  XANDER (huh?) Good. It's good that you're fine.  WILLOW What were you thinking about?  BUFFY Nothing.  XANDER Come on, you can tell us! We're your  bosom friends. The friends of your  bosom.  WILLOW Xander...  BUFFY I wasn't thinking anything. Really. Did I  have think-face? 'Cause there was nothing  going on.
Hello.
I missed --
Was that an insult?  XANDER Kinda lacked punch.  WILLOW The Three Musketeers were cool.  CORDELIA (considering) I see your point...  XANDER I would have gone with 'Stooges'.  CORDELIA Well, I just meant you all hang out  together. So, did you guys fight demons  all summer?
(re: the other two) I think I would have to go with  'Stooges' also.  CORDELIA What are you guys talking about? I'm  talking about big squiggly demons that  come from the ground. Remember, on  prom night, with all the vampires?  BUFFY Cordelia. Your mouth is open. Sound  is coming from it. This is never good.
That works out great. You don't tell  anyone I'm the Slayer, and I won't  tell anyone that you're a moron.
Oh. Hi again.  ANGEL Hi.  BUFFY Is there danger at the Bronze?  ANGEL I can't help thinking I've done something to make you angry. That bothers me  more than I'd like.  BUFFY I'm not angry. I have no idea where that comes from.  ANGEL What are you afraid of? Me? Us?  BUFFY Uh, could you contemplate getting  over yourself? There's no 'us'. I'm  sorry if I was supposed to spend the  summer mooning over you, but I  didn't. I moved on. To the living.
Xander, did I ever thank you for saving my life?  XANDER No.
Don't you wish I would?
As defending champion, are you  nervous?  CORDELIA I can hold my own. (stepping forward) We've never been close, Buffy, which  is nice, 'cause I don't like you very  much. But you have, on occasion,  saved the world and all that stuff,  so I'm gonna do you a favor.  BUFFY Joyous me.  CORDELIA Your friends can't do it, 'cause they  like you. And they're sort of afraid  of you.  BUFFY What's the favor?  CORDELIA I'm going to give you some advice.  Get over it.  BUFFY Excuse me?  CORDELIA Whatever's causing the Joan Collins  'tude, deal with it, embrace the pain,  spank your inner moppet but <b>get over it</b>,  'cause pretty soon you won't even have  the loser friends you've got now.  BUFFY I'd say it's about time for you to mind  your own business.  CORDELIA It's long past. Nighty night.
He's dead, he's dead... he's dead... 
This is Cordelia's.
This is my fight.
You know, being stalked isn't really  a big turn-on for girls.  ANGEL You need help. Someone to watch your back.  BUFFY You sure you don't mean my neck?  ANGEL Why are you riding me?
Because I don't trust you. You're a  vampire. Or is that an offensive term?  Should I say 'undead American'?  ANGEL You have to trust someone. You can't  do this alone.  BUFFY I trust me.  ANGEL You're not as strong as you think.  BUFFY You think you could take me?  ANGEL What?  BUFFY Come on, you must have wondered...  a vampire, the Slayer, I know you've  thought about it. If it came down to a  fight... could you take me? Why don't  we find out?  ANGEL I'm not gonna fight you.  BUFFY No? Big strong vampire like yourself?  ANGEL Buffy...  BUFFY Come on. Kick my ass.
I do.  ANGEL Well, you're wasting time.
Just stay out of my way.  ANGEL Happy to oblige.
That's not Cordelia.
You're right. Why would they send just one?
Watch her. Don't kill her if you don't have to.  ANGEL Buffy, what's going on?  BUFFY I'll be back.
Xander?
We have to think. Why did they take them?  XANDER If they hurt Willow I'm gonna kill you.  BUFFY (realizes) Why did they take them and not you?
One more time.
So. One more time.
I'm gonna kill them all. (walking away) That oughta distract them.
So, are you gonna kill me? Or are you  just making small talk?
I don't think I can face them.  GILES Of course you can.  BUFFY I can't! What am I gonna say? 'Sorry  I almost got your throats cut. What's  the homework?'  GILES Punishing yourself like this is pointless.  BUFFY It's entirely pointy! I was a moron. I  put my best friends in mortal danger -  on the second day of school!  GILES What are you going to do, crawl into  a dark cave for the rest of your life?  BUFFY Would it have cable?
