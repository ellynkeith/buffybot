Mr. Giles.  GILES (jibbering fool) Well, uh, dyeh, nnn, hello.
It's good to see you.  GILES Yes.  MR SNYDER You think they're thinking about  learning?  GILES Are you heading towards the faculty  room?  JENNY That sounds like fun.  MR SNYDER I try to talk sense to 'em, tell 'em about  the really important things in life.  Responsibility, discipline, punctuality...  I might as well be talking to myself. 
You probably spent all summer with your  nose in a book.  GILES I suppose you'd consider that terribly dull.   JENNY (flirtatiously) Depends on the book.
We got vampires? I thought the  Hellmouth was closed.  GILES Closed, not gone. The mystical energy  it emits is still concentrated in this area.  XANDER Which means we're still the undead's  favorite party town.  GILES (to Buffy) This vampire -- could you tell where he  might be from?  BUFFY Local talent. Fresh. He was still wearing his  funeral ensemble.  GILES Which means there are other vampires  about, and they're already killing. I  should have been on top of that.  I wonder if they're here for some  particular purpose...  BUFFY You're the Watcher. I just work here.  GILES Well, I have to consult my books.  XANDER (looking at his watch) Eight minutes and thirty three seconds. (to Willow) Pay up. 
I think so. My head...  GILES (to Xander) Where's Buffy?
