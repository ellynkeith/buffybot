The first day back. It always get me.  GILES Yes.  MR SNYDER I mean, it's incredible. One day the  campus is completely bare, empty...  the next, children are everywhere.  Like locusts. Crawling around,  mindlessly bent on feeding and  mating, destroying everything in sight  in their relentless, pointless desire  to exist.  GILES I do love these pep talks. Have you ever  considered, given your abhorrence of  children, that school principal is perhaps  not your true vocation?  MR SNYDER Someone's gotta keep an eye on 'em.  They're just a bunch of hormonal timebombs.  Why, every time a pretty girl walks by,  every boy turns into a jibbering fool.  GILES Ms. Calendar!
I've seen the way these kids gaze at  each other, all moony -- 
I believe that some of us have classes. (to Giles) And some of us have jobs.  GILES (to the kids) I'll see you all in the library after school.  And we can finish our discussion.  WILLOW About trout.
There's some things I can just <b>smell</b>.  It's like a sixth sense.  GILES No, actually, that would be one of the five.  MR SNYDER The Summers girl? I smell trouble. I  smell expulsion. And just the faintest  aroma of jail.
You really have faith in those kids, don't you?  GILES Yes, I do.  MR SNYDER Weird.
