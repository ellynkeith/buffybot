Rupert Giles?
Doug Perren. (they shake) Thank you for coming.
Well, I talked to Lou Tabor at the Washington Institute,  he said we had the best authority on obscure relics right here in Sunnydale.
That's our baby. Construction crew dug it up just outside  of town, you know they're putting up those high-rises.
I know there were Spanish settlers here from way back,  we've found plenty of artifacts. But whatever's written on this. . . well, it ain't Spanish.
Any ideas?
We won't have the results for a couple of days. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say "old".
Open it?
I'll be damned. I figured it was solid. What do you think's in there?
I guess we won't find out till we open it.
You don't want to be surprised?
All right. You're the expert. I'm pretty damn curious, though.
Hello? (after a beat) Danny? That you?
