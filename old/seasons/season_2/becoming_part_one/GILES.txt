Hello?
Yes.
He may have exaggerated slightly. Is this the. . .
No. Not Spanish.
(still scanning it) A few. . . none I'd care to share until I can verify. . .  Have you dated this?
Yes, this predates any settlements  we've ever read about.
May I?
You haven't tried to open it, I assume.
I don't know.
If I could ask. . . wait. Let me work on translating this text.  It might give us some indication as to what we'll find inside.
As a rule, no.
Yes. Yes, so am I.
What are you saying?
She said it couldn't be done.
It's not that simple. This points  he way, but the ritual itself  requires a rather more advanced knowledge of the black arts  than I can claim.
Willow, performing this kind of ritual, channeling such potent majicks through yourself -- it will open a door you may not be able to close.
Xander, let's not lose perspective here --
Curing Angel was apparently Jenny's last wish --
Don't you speak of her in that insolent --
I've just been on the phone with the museum. The artifact in question is missing. And the curator has been murdered. Vampires.
Acathla. And yes, the information Kendra's Watcher has provided seems conclusive.
The demon universe exists in a dimension separate from our own.  With one breath Acathla will create a vortex, a kind of whirlpool that  will pull everything on Earth into that dimension, where any non-demon life will suffer horrible, eternal torment.
It was nothing, really.
Let's hope all else doesn't fail. (to Willow) How close are you to figuring out the ritual for the curse?
Spirit vault for the Rituals of the Undead. I've got one. (sheepish) I've been using it as a paperweight.
Well, Angel has a ritual of his own to perform before he can remove the sword and awake Acathla. With any luck, that may take some time as well.
Which means you just have to hold Angel off. Don't let him  close on you. If the curse succeeds, you'll know.
