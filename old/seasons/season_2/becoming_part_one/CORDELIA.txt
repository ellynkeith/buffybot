Boy, Willow, you've really gotten the teaching bug. Taking over that computer class, tutoring. . .
I think it's great to do that BEFORE you go out and fail in the real world. 'Cause then it's not like falling back on something, it's like falling. . . well, forward.
Gee, Xander, what are you gonna teach when you fail in life?  Advanced loser-being?
Don't touch me! You have fish hands!
Stop it!
How about, 'cause you're a tiny impotent Nazi with a bug up his  butt the size of an emu?
Don'tchya think?
Well, this is good, right? I mean, we can curse him again.
Xander has a point --
Wow. Even I know that was insensitive.
Why don't you just wait <b>here</b> to find out if it worked? See if he phones you?
