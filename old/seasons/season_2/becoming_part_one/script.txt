ANGEL: We'll come back when we've found a bit more cash money. Keep the girls warm.  (to his friend) Come on. We'll sneak in and take some of my father's silver. He'll never miss it. Eats with his hands, the pig.
ANGEL: Or why don't you rest here.
ANGEL: So I'd ask myself, what is a lady of your station doing alone in an alley with the reputation that this one has?
DARLA: Maybe she's lonely.
ANGEL: In that case I would offer myself as escort. To protect  you from harm, and to while away the dull hours.
DARLA: You're very gracious.
ANGEL: It's often been said.
DARLA: Are you certain you're up to the challenge?
ANGEL: Has a challenge been made, then?
ANGEL: My lady, you will find that with the exception of an honest day's work there is no challenge  I am not prepared to face. (reaches her, peers) God, but you're a pretty thing. Where are you from?
DARLA: Around. Everywhere.
ANGEL: Never been anywhere, myself. Always wanted to see the world, but. . .
DARLA: I could show you.
ANGEL: Could you, then?
DARLA: Things you've never seen. Never even heard of.
ANGEL: Sounds exciting.
DARLA: It is. And frightening.
ANGEL: I'm not afraid. Show me. Show me your world.
DARLA: Close your eyes.
BUFFY: Come on. Ooh, nice try.
BUFFY: Now that was just sloppy. If you're not even gonna try, then. . .
BUFFY: I want you to give Angel a message for me. Tell him  I'm done waiting. I'm taking the fight to him. You got that? Do you want me to write it down?
BUFFY: All right, I'll tell him myself.
XANDER: I'm good, don't worry about me. . .
BUFFY: You know, you don't have to patrol with me.
XANDER: Hey, I had that guy under control until he resorted to fisticuffs. (he shakes his head) What is that: five vampires in three nights?
BUFFY: But no Angel.
XANDER: You really that anxious to come up against him?
BUFFY: I just want it over with.
XANDER: I hear that.
BUFFY: We better get back. I haven't even started studying for finals.
XANDER: Oh, yeah, finals. Why didn't you let me die?
BUFFY: Look on the bright side. It'll all be over soon.
ANGEL: Yes, my love. It will.
GILES: Hello?
DOUG: Rupert Giles?
GILES: Yes.
DOUG: Doug Perren. (they shake) Thank you for coming.
DOUG: Well, I talked to Lou Tabor at the Washington Institute,  he said we had the best authority on obscure relics right here in Sunnydale.
GILES: He may have exaggerated slightly. Is this the. . .
DOUG: That's our baby. Construction crew dug it up just outside  of town, you know they're putting up those high-rises.
DOUG: I know there were Spanish settlers here from way back,  we've found plenty of artifacts. But whatever's written on this. . . well, it ain't Spanish.
GILES: No. Not Spanish.
DOUG: Any ideas?
GILES: (still scanning it) A few. . . none I'd care to share until I can verify. . .  Have you dated this?
DOUG: We won't have the results for a couple of days. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say "old".
GILES: Yes, this predates any settlements  we've ever read about.
GILES: May I?
GILES: You haven't tried to open it, I assume.
DOUG: Open it?
DOUG: I'll be damned. I figured it was solid. What do you think's in there?
GILES: I don't know.
DOUG: I guess we won't find out till we open it.
GILES: If I could ask. . . wait. Let me work on translating this text.  It might give us some indication as to what we'll find inside.
DOUG: You don't want to be surprised?
GILES: As a rule, no.
DOUG: All right. You're the expert. I'm pretty damn curious, though.
GILES: Yes. Yes, so am I.
CORDELIA: Is that it?
XANDER: That's it.
BUFFY: Yeah, that's just exactly how it happened.
OZ: I thought it was riveting. I was a little unclear about  some of the themes.
BUFFY: The theme is, Angel's too much of a coward to take me on face to face.
XANDER: The other theme was "Buy American," but it got kind of buried.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) Are you sure you're ready to fight Angel?
BUFFY: Can everybody stop asking me that? Yeah I'm ready. Also willing, also able. It's the one test I might actually pass.
WILLOW: Don't say that. You're gonna pass everything. I'm gonna get you  through this semester if I have to sweat blood.
XANDER: Do you think you're likely to? 'Cause I'd like to be elsewhere.
WILLOW: It was only metaphor blood.
OZ: I think you'd sweat cute blood.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) Sixth period, after my computer class, we'll rock on Chemistry.
BUFFY: I'm ready to rock. You're the best, Will. Thanks.
CORDELIA: Boy, Willow, you've really gotten the teaching bug. Taking over that computer class, tutoring. . .
WILLOW: I love it. I really do.
CORDELIA: I think it's great to do that BEFORE you go out and fail in the real world. 'Cause then it's not like falling back on something, it's like falling. . . well, forward.
XANDER: And almost sixty five percent of that was actual compliment. (to Cordy) Is that a personal best?
CORDELIA: Gee, Xander, what are you gonna teach when you fail in life?  Advanced loser-being?
XANDER: I will teach. . .  (eurotrash) . . . the language of love.
CORDELIA: Don't touch me! You have fish hands!
XANDER: Come, let me caress you. . .
CORDELIA: Stop it!
SNYDER: That's enough of that. (to Willow) And you. Are we having a chair shortage?
WILLOW: I haven't read anything about -- Oh! I get it.
SNYDER: These public displays of affection are not acceptable in my school.  This isn't an orgy, people. It's a classroom.
SNYDER: Do you have something to say?
BUFFY: This is a cafeteria. I'm pretty sure.
SNYDER: Always with the wisecracks. One day you're gonna go too far.
BUFFY: Or I could go with the classroom theory. . .
SNYDER: Just give me a reason to kick you out, Summers.  Just give me a reason.
CORDELIA: How about, 'cause you're a tiny impotent Nazi with a bug up his  butt the size of an emu?
BUFFY: Sums it up.
CORDELIA: Don'tchya think?
XANDER: Now 'lunch' I could actually teach.
OZ: I can see that. (as teacher) "Baloney. It's not a toy. Let's put it on the bread - The rye bread! Careful!" Lunch teacher.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) Do you want to come by tonight, do some cramming?
BUFFY: Maybe. . . I do have to patrol.
WILLOW: Again? Do you really expect Angel to turn up tonight?
BUFFY: No, I don't expect him to. And that's when he usually does.
DRUSILLA: Bless me, father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession.
DRUSILLA: Father?
ANGEL: Uh, uh, two days? That's not very long. You must sin a great deal to be back so soon.
DRUSILLA: Oh, father. . . I'm so afraid.
ANGEL: Hush, child. The Lord is very forgiving. Tell me your sins.
DRUSILLA: I had. . . I've been seeing again, father. Didn't try to, I swear! But yesterday the men were going to work in the mine and I had a terrible fright, my stomach all tied up and I saw a horrible crash,  men screaming in the dark. . .my mum said to keep my peace, it didn't mean nothing but this morning they had a cave in. Two men died.
ANGEL: Go on.
DRUSILLA: (it pours out:) My mum says I'm cursed. My seeing things is an affront  to the Lord. That only He's supposed to see anything before  it happens. But I don't mean to, Father, I swear. I try to be pure  in His sight and I do my penance, I don't want to be an evil thing.
ANGEL: Hush, child. The Lord has a plan for all creatures. Even a devil child like you.
DRUSILLA: (mortified) A devil. . .
ANGEL: Yes, you're a spawn of Satan, all the hail Mary's in the world aren't going to help. The Lord will use you and then smite you down, he's like that.
DRUSILLA: What can I do?
ANGEL: Fulfill his plan for you, child. Be evil. Perform evil works. Attack the less fortunate. You can start small: laugh at a cripple. You'll feel better. Just give in.
DRUSILLA: No. . . I want to be good. . . I want to be pure. . .
ANGEL: We all do, at first. World doesn't work that way.
DRUSILLA: Father, I beg you. . . help me.
ANGEL: Very well. Uh, ten Our Fathers and an act of contrition.  Does that sound good?
DRUSILLA: Yes, Father, thank you.
DRUSILLA: Yes?
ANGEL: God is watching you.
SPIKE: Nice walk, pet?
DRUSILLA: I met an old man. I didn't like him. He got stuck in my teeth. (looks up)  And then the moon started whispering to me. All sorts of dreadful things.
SPIKE: It's a naughty moon.
ANGEL: What did it say?
SPIKE: Oh, look who's awake.
ANGEL: What did the moon tell you? Did you have a vision?  Is something coming?
DRUSILLA: Oh yes. . . something terrible.
ANGEL: Where?
DRUSILLA: At the museum. A tomb. With a surprise inside.
ANGEL: You can see all that in your head?
SPIKE: No, you ninny, she read it in the morning paper.
ANGEL: Oh, my. . .
DRUSILLA: Is that what's been whispering to me?
ANGEL: Oh yeah. Don't worry though. Soon it'll stop.
ANGEL: Soon it'll scream.
BUFFY: Waaahhh.
BUFFY: This doesn't make sense!
WILLOW: Well, sure it does, see. . .  (looks at Buffy's work) Oh, no, that doesn't make any sense.
BUFFY: It's senseless.
WILLOW: It is. But at least you know that! So you're learning.
BUFFY: Yay me. (as Willow looks at her work) Oh well. It doesn't matter. I mean, in the real world when am I ever  gonna need to use chemistry, math, history or the English language?
WILLOW: (re: notebook) Oh, I see your problem.
BUFFY: I'm a moron?
WILLOW: Will you stop that? You're not stupid. You've just had a lot on your mind. You can do all of this real easily but if you're just gonna give up then <b>don't waste my time</b>.
BUFFY: Wow. You really are a good teacher.
WILLOW: (smiling) Good pep talk?
BUFFY: I got the pep.
WILLOW: Okay. Look at this. It's a covalent bond -- which means these two atoms are linked by this one electron. You know, basic linkage. Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Chlorine. . .
BUFFY: Oh. Hold it.
WILLOW: Well, you see --
BUFFY: Whoah. Deja vu.
WILLOW: Really?
BUFFY: --hey.
BUFFY: I think you dropped this.
WILLOW: It's not mine. It might be something of Ms. Calendar's.
BUFFY: This feels kind of morbid.
WILLOW: Well, I've gone through most of her files already.
BUFFY: Does that make this less morbid or you really morbid?
WILLOW: I had to -- to teach the class.
BUFFY: Relax. I'm making with the funny. What does that say, "restoration"?
WILLOW: It's one of her spells, I think. You know, she wasn't a practicing witch, but she did dabble in --
BUFFY: Willow.
WILLOW: Oh boy.
WILLOW: Oh boy.
WILLOW: Oh boy. 
WOMAN: (Rumanian) Nici mort nici al fiintei te invoc, spirit al trécerii Reda trupului ce separa omul de animal Cu ajutorul acestui magic glob de cristal (Not dead, nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum,  I call. Restore to the corporal vessel that which separates us  from beast. Use this orb as your guide.)
MAN: It hurts, yes? Good. It will hurt more.
ANGEL: Where am I?
MAN: You don't remember. Everything you've done. For a hundred years. In a moment you will. The face of everyone you have killed - our daughter's face -- they will haunt you and you will know what true suffering is.
ANGEL: Killed? I don't. . .
ANGEL: Oh. . . no. . . no. . .
GILES: What are you saying?
BUFFY: The curse. This is it.
WILLOW: It looks like Ms. Calendar was trying to replicate the original curse. To restore Angel's soul again.
GILES: She said it couldn't be done.
BUFFY: Well, she tried anyway. And it looks like it might have worked.
XANDER: So he killed her. Before she could tell anyone about it. What a prince.
CORDELIA: Well, this is good, right? I mean, we can curse him again.
GILES: It's not that simple. This points  he way, but the ritual itself  requires a rather more advanced knowledge of the black arts  than I can claim.
WILLOW: Well, I. . . I've been going through her files and reading up and. . . I've been sort of checking out the black arts. Just for fun -- or, educational fun. I might be able to work this.
GILES: Willow, performing this kind of ritual, channeling such potent majicks through yourself -- it will open a door you may not be able to close.
BUFFY: Will, I don't want you putting yourself in danger.
WILLOW: And I don't want danger. "No" to danger. But I might be the best person to do this.
XANDER: HI! For those of you who have just tuned in, everyone here is a crazy person. This spell might restore Angel's humanity? Well, here's an interesting angle: <b>Who cares</b>?
BUFFY: I care.
XANDER: Is that right?
GILES: Xander, let's not lose perspective here --
XANDER: I'm perspective guy! Angel is a killer.
WILLOW: Xander --
BUFFY: It's not that simple.
XANDER: What, come back home, all is forgiven? I can't believe you people!
CORDELIA: Xander has a point --
XANDER: (turning on Cordy) You know just once I wish you would support me and I realize right now that you were and I'm embarrassed so I'm gonna get back to the point which is that Angel needs to die.
GILES: Curing Angel was apparently Jenny's last wish --
XANDER: Yeah, well, Jenny's dead.
GILES: Don't you speak of her in that insolent --
XANDER: (simultaneously) Can't you see what I'm saying --
BUFFY: All right, stop it!
WILLOW: (to Buffy) What do you want to do?
BUFFY: I don't know. . . What happened to Angel wasn't his fault. . .
XANDER: What happened to Ms. Calendar is. You can paint this however you want. Way I see it you want to forget all about Ms Calendar's murder so you can have your boyfriend back.
CORDELIA: Wow. Even I know that was insensitive.
XANDER: (staring Willow down) Am I wrong?
DOUG: Hello? (after a beat) Danny? That you?
ANGEL: Let's see. . . I'll have one of these. (points at it) To go.
ANGEL: Be careful. I don't want this thing cracked. Your weak imitations of life depend on it. (to Dru, re: Doug) Save me some.
BUFFY: Yeah, I'll do a couple of sweeps, then I'll stop by. (listens) Yeah, Xander was pretty much being a. . .  (mildly shocked) Willow. Where'd you learn that word? My god. You kiss your mother with that mouth? (Listens) I don't know. I don't know what I want.
BUFFY: Okay. I'll see you in a while.
JOYCE: Where are you going?
BUFFY: Oh. Uh, to Willow's. To Study. Got two finals tomorrow.
JOYCE: All right. Make sure you two study. Don't talk about boys all night.
BUFFY: Oh, we don't like boys. I mean, while we're studying. We like boys. Some boys. . .
BUFFY: You know, it's funny. I've just been kind of. . . religious. Lately.
JOYCE: Oh. Well, you know your father and I are both agnostic, we always thought you should decide for yourself.
BUFFY: Well, I'm learning. . . sort of searching.
JOYCE: Well, that's good.
BUFFY: Okay.
JOYCE: Get a ride back if you come home late.
BUFFY: You know, polite people call before they jump out of the bushes and attack you.
KENDRA: Just wanted to test your reflexes.
BUFFY: (not angry) Would you like to test my face-punching? 'Cause I think you'll find it's improved.
KENDRA: I was on my way to your house. Saw you walking. Couldn't help myself.
BUFFY: Which begs the question and don't think I'm not glad to see you but why are you here? Wait. Let me guess. Your Watcher has informed you that a very dark power is about to rise in Sunnydale.
KENDRA: That's about it.
BUFFY: Great. Did he give you any idea of what this dark power is?
SPIKE: It's a big rock. I can't wait to tell my friends.  They don't have a rock this big.
ANGEL: Spike, boy, you never did learn your history.
SPIKE: Let's have a lesson, then.
ANGEL: Acathla, the demon, came forth to swallow the world. It was killed by a virtuous knight who pierced the demon's heart before it could draw breath to perform the act. Acathla  turned to stone, as demons sometimes do, and was buried where neither man nor demon would be wont to look. Unless of course they're putting up low rent housing. Boys?
DRUSILLA: Oooh, he fills my head. . . I can't hear anything else. . .
SPIKE: Let me guess. Someone pulls out the sword --
ANGEL: Someone worthy. . .
SPIKE: -- the demon wakes up and wackiness ensues.
DRUSILLA: He will swallow the world.
ANGEL: And every creature living on this planet will go to Hell. My friends,  we're about to make history. . .  (turning back to them) . . . end.
GILES: I've just been on the phone with the museum. The artifact in question is missing. And the curator has been murdered. Vampires.
BUFFY: And we're sure this thing was the Tomb of Alfalfa?
GILES: Acathla. And yes, the information Kendra's Watcher has provided seems conclusive.
WILLOW: Okay, can somebody explain the whole 'he will suck the world into Hell' thing? That's the part I'm not loving.
GILES: The demon universe exists in a dimension separate from our own.  With one breath Acathla will create a vortex, a kind of whirlpool that  will pull everything on Earth into that dimension, where any non-demon life will suffer horrible, eternal torment.
BUFFY: So that would be the literal kind of sucking into Hell. Neat.
KENDRA: (to Buffy) You think Angelus and the others are responsible for the theft of the tomb?
BUFFY: I'd bet folding money on it.
KENDRA: I can't believe you dated him. (off her look) I mean, he's got to be stopped.
WILLOW: We don't know where they are. They moved after Giles torched their house.
KENDRA: (to Giles) You did? Good for you.
GILES: It was nothing, really.
BUFFY: Willow. . . I think you should try to do the curse. Bring Angel back.
KENDRA: I tend to side with your friend Xander on this one. Angel should be eliminated.
BUFFY: I'll fight him. If I have to, I'll kill him. But if I lose, or I don't find him in time. . . Willow might be our only hope.
WILLOW: I don't want to be only hope. I crumble under pressure. Let's have another hope.
KENDRA: We have.
KENDRA: Blessed by the knight who first slew the Demon. If all else fails, this might stop it. (less confidently) I think.
GILES: Let's hope all else doesn't fail. (to Willow) How close are you to figuring out the ritual for the curse?
WILLOW: I need a day, maybe. And I need an Orb of Thesulah, whatever that is.
GILES: Spirit vault for the Rituals of the Undead. I've got one. (sheepish) I've been using it as a paperweight.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) This means I can't help you study for tomorrow's finals.
BUFFY: I'll wing it. Of course, if we go to Hell by then I won't have to take them. (sudden fear) Or maybe I'll be taking them forever. . .
GILES: Well, Angel has a ritual of his own to perform before he can remove the sword and awake Acathla. With any luck, that may take some time as well.
DRUSILLA: Spike, sweetie, the fun's about to begin.
SPIKE: It is? Seems more to me like the fun's about to end.
DRUSILLA: Don't be all gloomy.
SPIKE: Darling, if this works, everything changes. Think about it. In this world, we can be kings. In the next. . .
DRUSILLA: My Spikey's getting cold feet. Don't you worry about the next world. You'll always have me. . .
SPIKE: Will I?
DRUSILLA: Oh! The blood ritual! To cleanse Angel. Let's go and see.
SPIKE: (giving in) Well, if there's blood. . .
ANGEL: I will drink. . . the blood will wash in me, over me and I will be cleansed, I will be worthy to free Acathla. (to Spike and Dru) Bear witness, as I ascend. (looking at the man) As I become.
WHISTLER: God, are you disgusting.
WHISTLER: This is really an unforgettable smell. This is the stench of death you're giving off here. And the look says crazy homeless guy, it's not good.
ANGEL: Get away from me.
WHISTLER: What are you gonna do, bite me? Oh, horrors! A Vampire!
WHISTLER: Oh, but you're not gonna bite me 'cause of your poor tortured <b>soul</b>, it's so sad, a vampire with a soul, how poignant. I may physically vomit right here.
ANGEL: Who are you?
WHISTLER: Let's take a walk. Come on.
WHISTLER: (to the passerby) <b>What</b>? Yes, he's my lover, you mustn't <b>judge us</b>!
WHISTLER: God, I hate people.
WHISTLER: What are you eating, like a rat once a month? You're skin and bones here. Butcher shops are throwing away more blood in a day than you could stand. Good blood. You lived in the world  a little bit you'd know that.
ANGEL: I want to know who you are.
WHISTLER: And I want to know who <b>you</b> are.
ANGEL: You already do.
WHISTLER: Not yet. I'm looking to find out. 'Cause you could go either way here.
ANGEL: I don't understand you.
WHISTLER: Nobody understands me. It's my curse.
WHISTLER: (to the vendor) Dog me. (to Angel) There are three kinds of people that no one understands. Geniuses,  madmen, and guys that mumble. My name is Whistler. Anyway,  lately it is. My real name is hard to pronounce unless you're a dolphin.
ANGEL: You're not a vampire.
WHISTLER: A demon, technically. But I'm not a bad guy -- not all demons are dedicated to the destruction of all life. Someone has to maintain balance, you know. Good and evil can't exist without each other, blah blah blah. I'm not like a good fairy or anything,  I'm just trying to make it all balance -- do I come off defensive?
ANGEL: What did you mean, I could go either way?
WHISTLER: I mean you could become an even more useless rodent than you are  right now, or you could become. . . someone. A person. Someone to be counted.
ANGEL: I just want to be left alone.
WHISTLER: You've been alone for what, ninety years? And what an impressive package you are. The stink guy.
ANGEL: You don't know what I have to deal with. What I've done.
WHISTLER: <b>You're annoying me</b>! The self pity thing is not gonna bring in the chicks. It's a bore.
ANGEL: What do you want from me?
WHISTLER: I want you to see something. It's happening very soon, we'd need to leave now. You see, and then you tell me what you want to do.
ANGEL: Where is it?
BUFFY: So, I'm like, "Dad, you want me to go to the dance in an outfit I've already worn? Why do you hate me?"
GIRL: Is Tyler taking you?
BUFFY: Oh my god! Where were you when I got over Tyler? He's of the past. Tyler would have to crawl on his hands and knees to get me to go to the dance with him. Which he's  actually supposed to do after practice, so I'm gonna wait.
GIRL: Okay. See you later.
BUFFY: Call me. Call me. Call me.
MERRICK: Buffy Summers?
BUFFY: Yeah? Hi. What?
MERRICK: I need to speak with you.
BUFFY: You're not from Macy's, are you? 'Cause I meant to pay for that lipstick. . .
MERRICK: There isn't much time. You must come with me. Your destiny awaits.
BUFFY: I don't have a destiny. I'm destiny-free. Really.
MERRICK: Yes, you have. You are the chosen one. You alone can stop them.
BUFFY: Who?
MERRICK: The vampires.
BUFFY: Huh?
BUFFY: AAAAAAGHHHH!
BUFFY: Oh god oh god oh god --
BUFFY: Whoah! Wow.
BUFFY: Ooh, that's not the heart. . .
BUFFY: GAAAGHHH!
MERRICK: You see? You see your power?
JOYCE: Why didn't you call?
BUFFY: I'm sorry, Mom, I didn't know it was so late. Tyler and I were talking.
JOYCE: That boy is irresponsible.
BUFFY: It's my fault.
JOYCE: You know we worry, that's all. Dinner's in ten minutes.
BUFFY: Okay.
WHISTLER: She's gonna have it tough, that Slayer. She's just a kid. And the world is full of big bad things.
ANGEL: I want to help her. I want to. . . I want to become someone.  I want to help.
WHISTLER: Jeez, look at you. She must be prettier than the last Slayer. (Angel looks down) It's not gonna be easy. The more you live in the world the more you see how apart from it you are. And this is dangerous work. Right now you couldn't go three rounds  with a fruit fly.
ANGEL: I want to learn from you.
WHISTLER: Okay.
ANGEL: But I don't want to dress like you.
WHISTLER: See? Again you're annoying me.
ANGEL: Everything that I am, everything that I have done, has led me here.  This night. This act. (to the statue) You will be free.
ANGEL: The ritual. There must be something I missed. The incantations, the blood. . . Dammit! I don't know. . .
DRUSILLA: This is so disappointing. What are we going to do?
ANGEL: What we always do in a time of trouble. Turn to an old friend. We'll have our Armageddon, I swear.
VAMPIRE: You will come to him.
VAMPIRE: You will come to him or more will die! Tonight!
VAMPIRE: His hour is at hand!
BUFFY: She said more would die. I have to go.
KENDRA: And I should go with you.
BUFFY: I need you here. Just in case. I'll be all right. As long as  Angel's fighting me he's not doing this end of the world ritual and that's good. And with any luck. . . Willow? What do you think?
WILLOW: I'm not sure. I just want to cross check --
BUFFY: We don't have time. If this is gonna work I need it to work now.
WILLOW: I need maybe half an hour once we're set up.
GILES: Which means you just have to hold Angel off. Don't let him  close on you. If the curse succeeds, you'll know.
CORDELIA: Why don't you just wait <b>here</b> to find out if it worked? See if he phones you?
BUFFY: I can't risk him killing more people.
XANDER: What if he shows up with an army?
BUFFY: I'll run away.
KENDRA: A Slayer never runs aw --  (off their looks) Good plan.
BUFFY: I'd better go.
XANDER: Please be careful.
BUFFY: I will.
KENDRA: Here. In case the curse does not succeed. . . This is my lucky stake. I have killed many vampires with it. (in a low voice) I call it Mister Pointy.
BUFFY: You named your stake.
KENDRA: (embarrassed) Yes.
BUFFY: Remind me to get you a stuffed animal. (Puts the stake in her jacket) Thanks.
KENDRA: Watch your back.
ANGEL: Hello, lover.
ANGEL: I wasn't sure you'd come.
BUFFY: After your immolation-o-gram? Come on, I had to show. But shouldn't you be destroying the world right about now? Pulling the sword out of Al Franken, or  whatever he's called?
ANGEL: There's time enough. I wanted to say goodbye first. You are the one thing in this dimension I will miss.
BUFFY: (suppressing emotion) This is a beautiful moment we're having here. Can we just fight, please?
ANGEL: (hurt) I didn't come here to fight!
BUFFY: No?
ANGEL: Gosh, I was hoping we could get back together! What do you  think, do we have a shot?
ANGEL: All right, we'll fight.
GILES: (Latin) Quod perditum est, invenietur. (What was lost, shall be found.)
WILLOW: Not dead, nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum, I call.
BUFFY: (quietly) Come on, Willow.
WILLOW: Let him know the pain of humanity, gods -- reach your wizened hands to me, give me the soul of --
XANDER: Look out!
XANDER: Go!
ANGEL: Is it me, or is your heart not in this?
