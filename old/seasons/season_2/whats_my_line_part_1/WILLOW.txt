We won't be young forever.
I came down on the side of shrubs.
So why are you even taking the test?
You're not even a teensy weensy bit  curious about what kind of career you could have had? I mean, if you  weren't already the Slayer and all.
Alone?
Angel, ice-skating…
What's this about?
(cheerfully) But, donuts…
You didn't check to see which seminar  I was assigned to, did you?
I wasn't what?
But I handed in my test. I used a  number two pencil.
It's not the kind of test you pass or fail.
I'm looking for Buffy.
If she doesn't get back soon,  Snyder's really - (suddenly perking up) -done a fantastic job setting up the  fair this year, hasn't he, Xander?
(innocently) Who?
Oh, you mean Buffy? I just saw her-
But I did - see her a minute ago.  And she is - around here somewhere.
Okay. See you-
Excuse me?
What is all this?
But - I didn't even get my test back.
Is that a good thing?
(to Buffy) So Giles is sure that the vampire who  stole his book is connected to the one you slayed last night? Or is it "slew?"
(re: article) According to this, du Lac destroyed  every one of the crosses - except the  one buried with him.
How?
Goody! Research party!
She should go. You know, gather  her strength?
'Cause you're the scourge of the underworld?
I wish there was more we could do.
I've never seen Buffy like that. She  just took off.
It's good that she took you seriously,  Giles. I just wish we knew where  she was.
Don't warn the tadpoles!
Giles? What are you doing here?
Oh… I…
I - I have frog fear. (then) I'm sorry, I conked out -
You did?
A vampire like - Drusilla?
What does that have to do with the  Order of Taranta? The assassins?
So this is good. We know what the deal is.
So this is bad.
Then - why are you all pinched?
