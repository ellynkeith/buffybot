Buffy - you scared me.
Excuse me?
Oh, I, no-
Nothing.
(confesses) I wanted to make sure you were okay.  I had a bad feeling.
What is it, then?
Career week?
I lurk.
You want - what? It's okay.
Before me.
Is that what you want? Football games?
I don't want you to feel stuck-
I'll never be a kid.
Was this part of your normal life?
You wanted to be like her.
When was the last time you put  on your skates?
There's a rink out past Route 17.  It's closed on Tuesdays.
I know.
You're in danger. You know what  the ring means?
I'm serious. You should go home and  wait until you hear from me.
Are you okay?
Forget about me. You're hurt.
No you haven't.
This is bad, Buffy. We have to get  you someplace safe.
Let's just get you out of here.
It's not that. (re: vamp face) I - you shouldn't have to touch me  when I'm like this.
You know. When I'mâ€¦
I need some information.
Sure you are, Willy. And I'm taking  up sunbathing.
Who sent them?
The Order of Taranta -
Let's try again. The Order of Taranta.  They're after the Slayer -
Was it Spike?
You know, I'm a little rusty when it comes  to killing humans. It could take a while.
I'll take care of Spike.
Where can I find him?
It will cost who?
Even if I knew - I wouldn't tell you.
Who are you?
I won't hurt you if you tell me what  I need to know.
You think this is funny?
You stay away from her.
When I get out of here I'll do more  than threaten -
