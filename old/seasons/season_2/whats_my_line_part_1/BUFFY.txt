So - mark "none of the above."
You're not stupid. (looking up) Do I like shrubs?
(to Willow) What'd you put?
Go shrubs. Okay. (puts down pencil) I shouldn't even be bothering with this.  It's all moot-ville for me. No matter  what my aptitude test says - I already  know my deal.
(holds up pencil) Pointy wooden things.
It's Principal Snyder's "hoop" of the  week. He's not happy unless I'm jumping. Believe me, I wouldn't be  here otherwise.
(snapping) Do the words "sealed" and "fate" ring  any bells for you, Will? Why go there?
I'm sorry. It's just - unless hell freezes  over and every vamp in Sunnydale puts  in for early retirement - I'd say my future  is pretty much a non-issue.
Does "rest in peace" have no sanctity  to you people?
Oh, I forgot - you're not a people.
One down -
One gone…
So. Just dropping by for some quality  time with Mr. Gordo?
The pig.
What's up?
You don't have "nothing" face. You have  "something" face. And you don't have to  whisper. Mom's in L.A. till Thursday.  Art buying, or something.
(curt) Oh surprise. Angel comes with bad news.
Sorry… I've been cranky miss all day.  It's not you.
We're having this thing at school-
How did you know?
Oh, right. So you know, then. It's this  whole week of "what's my line?" Only  I don't get to play. (then) Sometimes I just want…
The Cliffnotes versions? I want a  normal life. Like I had before.
It's not that. It's just… This career  business has me contemplating the  el weirdo that I am. Let's face it -  instead of a job I have a calling.  Okay? No chess club or football games  for me. I spend my free time in grave yards and dark alleys…
Maybe. Maybe not. But, you know what? -  I'm never going to get the chance to find  out. I'm stuck in this deal.
Angel - I don't mean you. You're the  one freaky thing in my freaky world  that makes sense to me. (then) I just get messed sometimes - wish we  could be like regular kids.
Okay then. Just a regular kid and her  cradle-robbing, creature-of-the-night  boyfriend.
My Dorothy Hamill phase. My room in  L.A. was this major shrine - Dorothy  posters, Dorothy dolls. I even got the  Dorothy haircut. (embarrassed) Thereby securing a place for myself  in the Geek Hall of Fame.
I wanted to be her. (then) My parents used to fight a lot. Skating  was an escape. I felt safe…
Like, a couple hundred demons ago.
Tomorrow's Tuesday.
Unless some unforeseen evil pops up.  But I'm in full see-no-evil mode.
I know. Two worlds collide.
Crossing guard, maybe. But prison guard?
At least you'll be on the right side  of the bars.
As in police?
Uggh.
I'll jump off that bridge when I come  to it. First I have to deal with Giles-
He's on this Tony Robbins hyper-efficiency  kick. He wants me to check in with him  now every day after homeroom.
Color me stunned.
Semi. I caught one out of two vamps  after they stole something from this jumbo mausoleum at the cemetery-
Yep. They had tools, torches, the whole  nine yards… (then) What does that mean? The whole nine  yards… nine yards of what? Now that's gonna bug me all day.
Giles, you're in pace mode. What gives?
No - but let me take a wild guess.  Some old thing?
So am I. I bet it was downright crusty.
Have a cow, Giles. I thought it was  just everyday vamp hijinks.
(cutting him off/hurt) If you don't like the way I'm doing  my job - why don't you find someone  else? Oh right. "There can be only one."  Long as I'm alive, there isn't anyone  else. Well, there you go! I don't have  to be the Slayer. I could be dead!
Wouldn't be much of a change, anyway.  I mean, either way I'm bored, constricted,  I never get to shop and my hair and  fingernails continue to grow so really,  what's the dif?
Get with the program, Giles.  We have work to do, remember?
Bingo. You know why? I am immature!  I'm a teen! I've yet to mature!
You were harsh. You act like I picked  this gig. But I'm the picked. Too bad  if I want a normal job.
It's one thing being a Watcher and a  librarian. They go together - like  chicken and… another chicken.  Two chickens. Or something.
You know what I'm saying - you can  spend all your time with a bunch of  books and no one blinks. But what  can I do? Carve stakes for a nursery?
This is the place.
Be my guest.
Note to self: Religion - freaky.
I hate when you say that.
Was he a saint?
Excommunicated and sent to Sunnydale.  Must have been big with the sinning.
I'm guessing it wasn't a Taste of the  Vatican Cookbook.
Then everything's cool. The sect is gone.  Worm food like old du Lac, right?
You think they've figured out how  to read the book?
You're saying these vampires went to  all that trouble for your basic decoder ring?
Why destroy his own work?
Speaking of… I have to bail. I promise  I'll be back bright and early, perky  and ready to slay.
I know. But you have to admit, I lack  in the book area. You guys are the brains.  I'd just be around for moral support-
Sorry, Xand. I have something I really  need to do tonight-
Angel?
What ever happened to fat and jolly?
And the hellmouth presents - 'Dead Guys  On Ice'. Not exactly the evening we  were aiming for…
I just killed a Superbowl champ?
What about you? That cut -
Hey. No biggy. I've been slammed by  bigger sides of beef than that -
No. I haven't.
You mean - hide?
Wait. Your eye is all… Let me -
Come on. Don't be a baby. I won't  hurt you.
Like - what?
Oh.
I didn't even notice.
This guy was hard core, Giles. And  Angel was power-freaked by the ring.
These assassins. Why would they  be after me?
Yeah, but I haven't been that scourgy lately.
Okay. You and Angel have both told  me to head for the hills. What's the deal?
(scared) When do we have a usual circumstance,  Giles? I mean - mummy girls and snake  guys and… But you've never told me  to hide before. I mean - you're saying  I can't handle this? These guys are that bad?
Try it!
Sorry.
Nothing.
Angel?
Hey…
You must be number two -
Thanks for the wake-up. But I'll stick  with my clock radio.
Come on. Don't make me do the  chick fight thing -
You know -
Cliched - but effective.
What do you mean who am I? You  attacked me. Who the hell are you?
