Let's start again. You're the who?
Nice cover story. Here's a tip - try it on someone who's not the real slayer.
Could you stop with the slayer thing? I'm the damn slayer!
Okay . . . Scenario: I back off. You promise not to go all wiggy until we go to my watcher and figure out what this is all about.
You know - no kicko, no fighto?
Yeah - it's something about being woken by an axe. Makes me talk all crazy. (then) So you were sent here?
To do what, exactly?
What? So he's a real guy? As in, non-fictional?
(irked) We got that part. He means your name.
Can you say - stuck in the 80's?
Back off, Pink Ranger. This is my friend-
You know. Person you hang with? Amigo?
You try. I'm tapped.
There's been a big mix-up.
(defensive) I was only gone for a minute.
Just a little.
What's the flum? It's a mistake. She isn't supposed to be here. She goes home. (to Kendra) No offense. But, I'm not dead and it's a teeny bit creepy having you around.
So what was your plan for fighting this dark power? Just sort of attack people till you found a bad one?
Then why the hell did you jump me?
Oooh, a swing and a miss for the rookie.
Yes right. (to Kendra) You saw me with Angel. He's a vampire but he's good.
He had a gypsy curse.
Just trust me. Angel's on the home team now. Wouldn't hurt a fly.
When you what? What did you do  to him?
What did you do?
Angel -?
What?
Yeah, I know the drill.
And I don't have to kill you.
Doesn't anyone just say "hello" where you come from?
That's nice for you, percepto girl. But we're not going to get anything out of him if he's oh, say, unconscious.
Where is Angel?
Where did he go? Home?
Are you telling me the truth?
Orders? I don't take orders. I do things my way.
Let's go.
Oh, that'll be a treat.
Good plan! Let's go! Charge!
(to Kendra) It's a little more complicated than that, okay, John Wayne?
(to Kendra) How do you know that stuff?
So - you have a lot of free time.
Handbook? What handbook? How  come I didn't get a handbook?
What do you mean - "it would be of no  use in my case?" What's wrong with my case?
(sotto) Hello and welcome to the planet  pocket protector.
Eeee, the career fair.
Right.
Get a load of the She-Giles.
I bet Giles wishes I were more of a  fact geek.
But you saw how he and Kendra were vibing. "Volume six - ha, ha, ha!"
I wonder . . .
No - I mean, I wonder if it would be so bad. Being replaced.
Maybe. It would be wild if, after this thing with Spike and the assassins is over, I could say - "Kendra, you slay. I'm going to Disneyland . . ."
No, Disneyland would get boring after a few months. But I could do . . . other stuff. Any stuff. Career day stuff. Who knows, Willow, I might even be able to have, like, a normal life . . .
Okay, my tests say I should be looking into law enforcement - duh - and environmental design . . .
(shrugs) I checked the shrub box. Landscaping was yesterday - so law it is.
Don't look now, Will, but that guy over there is totally checking you out.
Really? Then why is he on his  way over?
(to Willow) Told you.
Here.
Get down!
Don't!
(to Giles) She was definitely one of the Taraka gang, Giles. And way gun happy.
Down girl-
Just say hello, Xander.
You and bug people, Xander. What's up with that?
Yeah. These Taraka guys are Uberbad. If Kendra hadn't been there today I would have been toast.
They need Drusilla's sire? You mean the vamp that made her?
(painfully) It's Angel. He's Drusilla's sire.
(to Giles) This thingy. This ritual. Will it kill him?
We have to do something. We have to find the church where this ritual  takes place-
Look, you've got your priorities and I've got mine. Right now, they mesh. You gonna work with me or are you gonna get out of my way?
Good. Cause I've had it. Spike is going down. You can attack me, you can send assassins after me . . . that's  just fine. But nobody messes with my boyfriend.
Yup.
Nope. Must be in the handbook. Right after the chapter on personality removal.
Careful with that thing.
Yeah, it's okay. Kendra killed the bad lamp.
When this is over, I'm thinking pineapple pizza and teen video fest - possibly something from the Ringwald oeuvre.
And he says it like it's a bad thing?
You mean the part where I occasionally have one? Yeah, I  guess it is.
What do you mean - even family?
How young?
Oh. I'm-
It just sounds very lonely.
What? Kendra - my emotions give me power. They're total assets.
Huh. I guess that explains it.
When we were fighting. You're amazing. Your technique. It's flawless. Better than mine-
(bristles) Still - I would have kicked your butt in the end. And you know why?  No imagination.
Yep. You're good. But power alone isn't enough. A great fighter goes  with the flow. She knows how to improvise. Don't get me wrong, I mean, you have potential-
That would be anger you're feeling.
You feel it, right? How the anger gives you fire? A slayer needs that.
I'm guessing dating isn't big with your Watcher either.
Unless you're pummeling them, right? (sudden thought) Wait a minute.
That guy. The sleazoid you nearly  decked in the bar.
I think we might make him.
How about this ritual tonight? What have you heard?
She - likes to hit.
Let's go.
Excuse me? While we run to Giles, the whole thing could go down-
It's brainless, you mean! If we don't go now - Angel could be history.
It's not all. But it's enough.
He'll die-
I'm going. With you or without you.
Then I guess this is goodbye.
(to herself) Angel . . .
What?
It's your lucky day, Spike.
No waiting.
Switch!
Mutual.
I'm good . . .
It's gonna be okay . . .
Oh, hey, it looks better on -- well, me, but don't worry.
Now, when you get to the airport --
Very good.
Exactly. Relax. You earned it. You sit. You eat the peanuts. You watch the movie, unless it's about a dog or Chevy Chase.
Thank you. For helping me save Angel.
Tell me about it.
Well, then, maybe they won't fire me for dating him.
Do what?
You get that from the handbook?
I guess I can't fight it. I'm a freak.
Not anymore.
No. Good. Hate hugs.
