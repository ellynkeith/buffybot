Ah. I was dreaming-
Beautiful. We were in Paris. You had a branding iron . . .
And there were worms in my baguette . . .
Angel?
Forever.
Let me have him. Until the moon.
Bring him to me.
You've been a very bad daddy.
My mother ate lemons. Raw.
She said she loved the way they made  her mouth tingle-
Little Anne - her favorite was custard . . . Brandied pears . . .
(stern) Shhhhhh. (then) And pomegranates. They used to  make her face and fingers all red-
Remember little fingers? Little hands? (beat) Do you?
(snapping) Bite your tongue . . . They used to eat. Cake. And eggs. And honey. (sweet as can be) Until you came and ripped their throats out-
You remember?
You remember that kind of hungry?
You used to feed me.
You think you don't have it in you now. But you do. I can feel it.
I can almost taste it.
Say uncle?
Oh. That's right - you killed my uncle.
It makes pretty colors.
Shhhhhhhhh. Bad dog.
Spike - NO!
Spike. The moon is rising. It's time.
Don't worry, dear heart. I'll see that you get strong again . . .
Like me.
