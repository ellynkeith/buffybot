I'm the slayer.
You can't stop me. Even if you kill me, another slayer will be sent to take my place.
Nonsense. There is but one - and I am she.
Wiggy?
I accept your scenario.
Your English is very odd, you know.
Yes, by my Watcher.
To do my duty. I am here to kill vampires.
Yes, sir.
I am the vampire slayer.
Identify yourself!
Friend?
I - I don't understand.
And you allow this, sir?
But, the slayer must work in secret. For security-
Why?
She . . . died?
I cannot simply leave. I was sent here for a reason. Mr. Zabuto said all the signs indicate that a very dark power is about to rise in  Sunnydale.
Of course not.
(sheepish) I thought you were a vampire.
I had good reason to think you were. Did I not see you kissing a vampire?
Angel? You mean Angelus? I've read of him. He is a monster.
Oh. (beat) He had a what?
I cannot believe you. He looked to me like just another animal when I -
I . . .
No ashes.
When a vampire combusts, he  leaves ashes.
So I did not kill him.
This one is dirty. I can feel it.
Then he is all right. We can return to your Watcher for our orders.
No wonder you died.
So you believe that Spike is attempting  to revive this Drusilla to health?
Then we will stop Spike.
The assassins? I read of them in the writings of Dramius.
I believe it was six, sir.
From my studies.
I study because it is required. The slayer handbook insists on it.
Yes, it was difficult. All those footnotes!
Buffy's a student here?
Right. Of course. I'd imagine she's a cheerleader, too.
She's gone.
I - I, hope . . . I thank you. I mean, sir . . . I will be of service.
The new moon? But that is tonight.
Angel? Our priority must be to stop Drusilla.
(a beat) I am with you.
And those two, they also know you  are the Slayer.
Did anyone explain to you what "secret identity" means?
Please. I am an expert in all weapons-
Sorry. This trigger mechanism is different. (conciliatory) Perhaps when this is over you can show me how to work it.
I'm not allowed to watch television. My Watcher says it promotes intellectual laziness.
Your life is very different than mine.
The things you do and have, I was taught distract from my calling. Friends. School. Even family.
My parents - they sent me to my watcher when I was very young.
I don't remember them, actually. I've seen pictures . . . But that's how seriously the calling is taken by my people. My mother and father gave me to my watcher because they believed that they were doing the right thing for me - and for the world. You see?
Please. I don't feel sorry for myself.  Why should you?
Emotions are weakness, Buffy. You shouldn't entertain them.
Maybe. For you. But I prefer to keep an even mind.
Explains what?
I know.
Really? You think so?
Potential . . .
I could wipe the floor with you  right now.
(thrown off) What?
I am not permitted to speak with boys.
What?
You think he might help us?
(impatient) Just hit him, Buffy.
First, we must return to the watcher.
But, it is procedure-
Is that all you're worried about? Your boyfriend?
It's as I feared. He clouds your judgment.  We can't stop this ritual alone-
He's a vampire. He should die! Why am I the only person who see it?
You're crazy. You'll be killed.
Two slayers.
That's my favorite shirt. (thinks) That's my only shirt!
She's good . . .
Let's get him out.
Thank you for the shirt. It is very generous of you.
I get on the plane with my ticket. And sit in a seat. Not the cargo hold.
That is not traveling undercover.
I'll remember.
I am not telling my Watcher about that. It is too strange that a slayer  loves a vampire.
Still, he is pretty cute.
You always do that.
You talk about slaying like it's a job.  It's not. It's who you are.
From you.
But not the only freak.
I don't hug.
