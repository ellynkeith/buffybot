Hi.
Hey.
Did you decide? Are you gonna become a corporate computer suit guy?
I'm not really a computer person. Or a work of any kind person.
I sort of test well. Which is cool, except then it leads to jobs.
Oh, yeah. E flat, diminished 9th.
The E flat's doable, but it's that diminished 9th . . . that's a man's chord. You could lose a finger.
Look out!
I'm shot. Wow. It's very . . . odd. And painful.
Oh. Hey. Animal cracker?
Suddenly painless.
Not well, but not worse.
Please, don't. I don't do thanks. I get all red and I have to bail. It's not pretty.
Look. Monkey. And he has a little hat. And pants.
The monkey is the only cookie  animal that gets to wear clothes, you  know that? (then/casual) You have the sweetest smile I've ever seen.
So I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sort of ripped? Like, is the hippo going - man, where are my pants? . . . I have my hippo dignity . . .
