It's nice.
I don't know… (points to the heart) Does she know what one of these is?
I'm sorry. But, never. (off his look) I just think you could find someone  more… better.
(gets the point) Oh.
I'm glad you guys are getting along.  Almost really. And you shouldn't  stress about the gift.
She'll love it.
Sorry, Xand. Have to say slaying is a  tad more perilous than dating.
Go ahead, you know you want to say it.
I think you've now told everybody.
Valentine's Day is just a gimmick to  sell cards.
Believe me when I say "Uh huh".
I'll be fine. Mom and I are gonna have  a pig-out and vidfest. It's a time  honored tradition among the loveless.
What?
You mean like Witchcraft?
And an amateur psycho. Amy's the  last person should be messing with  that stuff.
Have a sentence, even.
Right. Let's go.
Are you okay?
And?
Like what?
That bad.
It's a little late for both.
(doesn't move) I can't.
Mom?
(letting down) Sorry… You startled me.
(cutting him off) I can't talk right now. It's Angel.
It's all right.
"Soon?" Soon <u>what</u>, Giles? I mean,  you never held back on me until the  big, bad thing in the dark became my  ex-honey.
He said it with flowers. (off his look) This is no time to start being protective  guy. I can't just hang around - and I  can't prepare when I don't know what's  coming.
Skip it.
I don't want to know. I don't have a  puppy. We can skip it.
You mean, make Angel come after you?
I heard about you and Cordy. It's her loss.
You know what I'd like? Why don't  you and I go do something tonight.  Just us.
Yeah, we can comfort each other.
Play your cards right…
I don't know… I heard you and Cordy  broke up, I was surprised how glad  I was.
It's funny how you can see a person  every day and not really <b>see</b> them,  you know.
When you think about it, we make a lot  of sense -
Alone at last.
I'm going to give you a lot more than  that.
Come on, it's a party. (plays with belt) Aren't you gonna open your present?
So - this is all a game to you.
You make me feel this way and then  reject me. What am I - a toy?
I'll calm down when you explain yourself!
I don't think so. Xander? Tell her.
Funny. I know what your <u>face</u> wants-
What is this? You're two-timing me?
Whoah.
Uh, hi, Oz. I seem to be having a slight  case of nudity.
Can you grab me some clothes?
Really not an issue.
Scavenger hunt?
So she says. I think she's just so wigged  at hitting on one of my friends that  she's repressing. She's getting really  good at that, actually. I should probably  worry.
It's better than everybody trying to  axe murder you, right?
Any particular reason she should?
A month, at least. This was worse for  her than anyone. She loved you <u>before</u>  you invoked the great roofie spirit.  The rest of us…
Oh yeah. I remember coming on to  you. I remember begging you to  undress me… And then a sudden  need for cheese. (beat) I also remember that you didn't.
Undress me. It meant a lot to me, what  you said.
You came through, Xander. There  may be hope for you yet.
You're on your own, there.
