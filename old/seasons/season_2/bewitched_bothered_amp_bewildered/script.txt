XANDER: What do you think?
BUFFY: It's nice.
XANDER: But do you think Cordelia will like it?
BUFFY: I don't know… (points to the heart) Does she know what one of these is?
XANDER: Okay, big yuks. When are you guys  gonna stop making fun of me for dating  Cordelia?
BUFFY: I'm sorry. But, never. (off his look) I just think you could find someone  more… better.
XANDER: Parallel universe, maybe. Here the  only other person I'm interested in is  unavailable.
BUFFY: (gets the point) Oh.
XANDER: Besides, Cordy and I have really been  getting along. We don't fight as much.  Yesterday we just sat together, not even  speaking, you know, just enjoying  comfortable silence. (beat) Man, that was dull.
BUFFY: I'm glad you guys are getting along.  Almost really. And you shouldn't  stress about the gift.
XANDER: This is new territory for me. My  valentines are usually met with  heartfelt restraining orders.
BUFFY: She'll love it.
XANDER: I wish dating was like slaying - simple.  Direct. Stake to the heart, no muss no  fuss -
BUFFY: Sorry, Xand. Have to say slaying is a  tad more perilous than dating.
XANDER: You're obviously not dating Cordelia.
CORDELIA: Hey… Wait up!
CORDELIA: Excuse me? Where's the fire sale?
HARMONY: (cool) Oh, sorry. Didn't see you.
CORDELIA: Why didn't you guys call me back last  night? We need to talk about our outfits  for the dance - I'm going to wear red  and black so you'd better switch -
CORDELIA: Xander? What's he got to do with it?
HARMONY: Well, a girl wants to look good for her  geek.
CORDELIA: Xander is just -
HARMONY: When are you two gonna start wearing  cute little matching outfits? 'Cause I'm  planning to vomit.
BEAKMAN: Papers on my desk. Anybody tries to  leave without giving me a paper is  looking at a failing grade.
XANDER: Hah! This time I am ready for you.  No "F" for Xander today. This baby's  my ticket to a sweet "D minus".
WILLOW: Hey, Amy.
AMY: Hey. Are you guys going to the  Valentine's Dance at the Bronze?  I think it's gonna be fun.
BUFFY: Go ahead, you know you want to say it.
WILLOW: (to Amy) My boyfriend's in the band.
AMY: Cool.
BUFFY: I think you've now told everybody.
WILLOW: Only in this hemisphere.
AMY: (to Buffy) What about you?
BUFFY: Valentine's Day is just a gimmick to  sell cards.
AMY: Bad break up?
BUFFY: Believe me when I say "Uh huh".
BEAKMAN: Thank you…
BEAKMAN: Thank you…
BEAKMAN: Thank you…
XANDER: You're welcome.
WILLOW: I just hate to think of you solo on  Valentine's Day.
BUFFY: I'll be fine. Mom and I are gonna have  a pig-out and vidfest. It's a time  honored tradition among the loveless.
XANDER: Did you guys see that?
BUFFY: What?
XANDER: In class. I thought I just saw Amy  working some magic on Miss Beakman.
BUFFY: You mean like Witchcraft?
WILLOW: Well, her mom was a witch…
BUFFY: And an amateur psycho. Amy's the  last person should be messing with  that stuff.
XANDER: Maybe I should talk to -
GILES: Buffy. Might I have a word with you?
BUFFY: Have a sentence, even.
GILES: Good, well -
CALENDAR: (takes the leap) Rupert.
GILES: Miss Calendar.
CALENDAR: I - I'm glad we ran into each other,  actually. I was hoping we could…  Do you have a moment?
BUFFY: Right. Let's go.
BUFFY: Are you okay?
GILES: Me? I'll be fine. I'm more concerned  about you, actually. (then) Ever since Angel… turned - I've been  reading up on his earlier activities.  Learning more about his habits, feeding  patterns, the like…
BUFFY: And?
GILES: There's a disturbing trend. Around  Valentine's Day he's prone to rather  brutal displays of… what he would  think of as affection, I suppose.
BUFFY: Like what?
GILES: No - no need to go into detail.
BUFFY: That bad.
GILES: Suffice to say it would be best if you  stayed off the streets for a few nights.  I can patrol. Keep my eye on things.  Better safe than sorry.
BUFFY: It's a little late for both.
SPIKE: Fancy it, pet?
DRUSILLA: It's beautiful. Sparkly…
SPIKE: Nothing but the best for my -
ANGEL: Happy Valentine's Day, Dru.
DRUSILLA: Ooooh! Angel… It's still warm.
ANGEL: I knew you'd like it. I found it in a  quaint little shop-girl.
ANGEL: Cute.
ANGEL: Here. I'll just…
SPIKE: Leave it. I'll get it.
ANGEL: Done. (to Spike) I know Dru gives you pity access -  but you have to admit, it's so much  easier when I do things for her.
SPIKE: You'd do well to worry less about Dru  and more about that slayer you tramped  around with.
ANGEL: (smiles fondly) Dear Buffy. I'm still trying to decide  the best way to send my regards…
SPIKE: You could rip her lungs out. That might  make an impression.
ANGEL: It lacks poetry.
SPIKE: It doesn't have to. (to Dru) What rhymes with lungs?
DRUSILLA: Don't worry, Spike. Angel will find his  way… (looks at the heart) In time Angel always finds what speaks  to a girl.
WILLOW: (to Xander) I think I'm a groupie.
JOYCE: Pass me the Malomars.
BUFFY: (doesn't move) I can't.
JOYCE: (doesn't move) Good.
BUFFY: Mom?
JOYCE: Buffy! It's me.
BUFFY: (letting down) Sorry… You startled me.
JOYCE: Somebody left these for you.
XANDER: Hey.
CORDELIA: Your clothes. You look so nice.
XANDER: I let Buffy dress me. (off her look) Well, not physically…
CORDELIA: Perfect. You just had to make this  harder, didn't you?
XANDER: Okay. Clearly the fact that I please  you visually got us off on the wrong  foot here.
CORDELIA: Xander -
XANDER: Let me finish. I've been thinking a lot  about us. The why and the wherefore.  And, you know - once, twice. A  kissy here. A kissy there. You can  chalk it up to hormones. But hormones  only take you so far. (then) Okay. Really far. And maybe that's  all we have here. Tawdry teen lust. (sincere) But maybe - not. Maybe something in  you sees something… special in me.  And visa versa. I mean, I think I do.  See something. So -
CORDELIA: (pained) Xander. Thank you. It's beautiful.  I want to break up.
XANDER: (stunned/re: necklace) Not really the reaction I was going for.
CORDELIA: I'm sorry. I really am. It's just - who  are we kidding? I mean, even if parts  of us do see specialness… We just don't  fit.
XANDER: (anger growing) Yeah, okay - you know what's a good  day to break up with someone? <b>Any  day besides Valentine's Day</b>. Were  you just running low on dramatic irony?
CORDELIA: I know. I didn't mean to do it like this -
XANDER: Well you did.
JOCK: Dude! Way to get dumped!
XANDER: Buffy. My bud. You would not  believe the kind of day -
BUFFY: (cutting him off) I can't talk right now. It's Angel.
XANDER: Well, do you need help?
BUFFY: It's all right.
HARMONY: Gee, Xander, maybe you should learn  a second language so that <b>more</b> girls  can reject you.
AMY: What are you doing?
XANDER: Amy! Good to see you! You're a witch.
AMY: No, I'm not! That was my mom,  remember?
XANDER: I'm thinking it runs in the family. I  saw you working that mojo on Miss  Beakman. Maybe I should tell  someone about that.
AMY: That's not even - I never - that's so  mean!
XANDER: Blackmail is such an ugly word.
AMY: I didn't say blackmail.
XANDER: Yeah, well I'm about to blackmail you  so I thought I'd bring it up.
AMY: What do you want?
XANDER: What do I want? I want a little respect  around here. I want - for once - to  come out ahead. I want the hellmouth  working for me.
XANDER: You and me, Amy… We're gonna cast  a little spell.
AMY: A love spell?
XANDER: Just the basic. You know - can't eat,  can't sleep, can't breathe anything but  little old moi.
AMY: That kind of thing is the hardest. I  mean, to make someone love you for  all eternity -
XANDER: Whoa. Back up. Who said anything  about eternity? A man can only talk  self-tanning lotion for so long  before his head explodes.
AMY: Then - I don't get it. If you don't want  to be with her forever - what's the  point?
XANDER: The point is - I want her to want me.  Desperately. Then I can break up with  her and subject her to the same hell  she's putting me through.
AMY: I don't know, Xander. Intent has to  be pure with love spells.
XANDER: Right. I intend revenge. Pure as the  driven snow. Now are you going to  play or do we need to chat some  more about invisible homework?
AMY: I'll need something of hers. A personal  object.
BUFFY: "Soon?" Soon <u>what</u>, Giles? I mean,  you never held back on me until the  big, bad thing in the dark became my  ex-honey.
GILES: Where did this come from?
BUFFY: He said it with flowers. (off his look) This is no time to start being protective  guy. I can't just hang around - and I  can't prepare when I don't know what's  coming.
GILES: Of course - you're right. Sit down.
XANDER: Don't flatter yourself. I'm not going  to make a big scene. I just want the  necklace back.
CORDELIA: What? I thought it was a gift.
XANDER: <u>Last night</u> it was a gift. Today it's scrap  metal. I figure I can melt it down -  sell it for fillings or something.
CORDELIA: You're pathetic…
XANDER: Come on. I'm not going to add to the  "Cordelia Chase Cast-Off Collection."
CORDELIA: (stalling) It's in my locker.
XANDER: I can wait.
CORDELIA: Here. Thank God we broke up. Now  I don't have to pretend to like it.
AMY: "Diana, goddess of love and the hunt.  I pray to thee. Let my cries bind the  heart of Xander's beloved. May she  neither rest nor sleep…"
AMY: "until she submits to his will only.  Diana! Bring about this love and  bless it!"
AMY: Blow out the candle! Now!
XANDER: Great. Really. Good spell… Can I put  my shirt on now?
CORDELIA: <b>What</b>?
XANDER: (all smiles) Morning, ladies. (seductively) Some weather we've been having.
CORDELIA: What do you want? You can't be sniffing  around for more jewelry to melt -  'cause all you ever gave me was that  Walmart-looking thing.
XANDER: Is this love? 'Cause, maybe on you it  doesn't look that different -
CORDELIA: (shoves him back) What is up? Are you going, like,  stalker-boy on me?
XANDER: Sorry. My mistake.
CORDELIA: Yeah. I'd say so.
CORDELIA: What is his deal?
HARMONY: I know. Did he cut his hair or something?  He looked half-way decent for a change.
GILES: Ah, here's another. Valentine's  Day, yes, Angel nails a puppy to -
BUFFY: Skip it.
GILES: But -
BUFFY: I don't want to know. I don't have a  puppy. We can skip it.
GILES: Right. Let me get the next batch.
XANDER: I have a plan. We use me as bait.
BUFFY: You mean, make Angel come after you?
XANDER: No I mean chop me into little pieces  and stick me on hooks for fish to nibble  at cuz that would be more fun than my  life.
BUFFY: I heard about you and Cordy. It's her loss.
XANDER: Not the popular theory…
BUFFY: You know what I'd like? Why don't  you and I go do something tonight.  Just us.
XANDER: Really?
BUFFY: Yeah, we can comfort each other.
XANDER: Would lap dancing enter into this scenario  at all? 'Cause I find that very comforting.
BUFFY: Play your cards right…
XANDER: Okay. You do know that I'm Xander,  right?
BUFFY: I don't know… I heard you and Cordy  broke up, I was surprised how glad  I was.
BUFFY: It's funny how you can see a person  every day and not really <b>see</b> them,  you know.
XANDER: (enraptured) It's funny. And it's just getting  funnier.
BUFFY: When you think about it, we make a lot  of sense -
AMY: Xander, can I talk to you for a minute?
XANDER: (to Amy) Yeah. Okay. (to Buffy) Hold that thought. Tightly.
AMY: Xander, I don't think the spell worked  out right.
XANDER: Yeah, we bombed. No biggie.
AMY: Well, we could try again. I'm still  pretty new at this.
XANDER: It's okay. You know what? It was  wrong to meddle with the forces of  darkness and I see that now. I think  we've all grown. I gotta go.
AMY: Well, we don't have to cast any spells -  we could just hang out.
XANDER: Sure… what?
AMY: Well, I really liked spending time  with you. You're so sweet… It's  funny how you can see a person  every day and -
XANDER: (his expression drains) -- not really see them?
AMY: Exactly!
AMY: So anyway, I thought it might be fun to -
KATIE: Hi, Xander?
XANDER: What?
KATIE: You're in Mr. Baird's history class,  right? I thought maybe we could  study together tonight.
AMY: Do you mind? We were talking.
XANDER: I really have to leave right now.
KATIE: Well, here's my number if  you want to -
WILLOW: Sorry. I wanted to surprise you.
XANDER: Good job. High marks.
WILLOW: Don't be so jumpy. I've been in your  bed before.
XANDER: Yeah, Will, but we were in footie  pajamas.
WILLOW: Xand. I've been thinking.
XANDER: Will, I think I know what you were  thinking, but this is all my fault, I cast  a spell and it sort of backfired -
WILLOW: (cutting him off) How long have we been friends?
XANDER: A long, long time. Too long to do  anything that might change it now.
WILLOW: But friendships always change. People  grow apart. They grow <u>closer</u>.
XANDER: This is good. How close we are now?  I feel very comfortable with this amount  of closeness. In fact, I could even back  up a few paces and still be happy…  See?
WILLOW: I want you, Xander. To be my first-
XANDER: (weakly hopeful) Baseman? Please tell me we're talking  softball.
XANDER: That's… dry clean only.
WILLOW: Shhhh. We both know it's right.
XANDER: It's not that I don't find you sexy-
WILLOW: Is it Oz? Don't worry about him. He's  sweet - but he's not you.
XANDER: Yes he is! And you should go to him.  'Cause he's me.
XANDER: Willow, don't make me use force.
WILLOW: Force is okay…
XANDER: That's it. This has all gotta stop. It's  time for me to act like a man. And hide.
CORDELIA: Ha. Very funny. What did I do now -  wear red and purple together?
HARMONY: (cold as ice) You know what you did. Xander is  wounded because of you.
CORDELIA: Are you tripping? I thought you wanted  me to break up with him-
HARMONY: You'd better look at yourself, Cordelia.  Only a sick pup would let Xander get  away - no matter what her friends say.
CORDELIA: <b>What does it take to make you people happy?</b>
GILES: Xander. What is it?
XANDER: It's me. Throwing myself at your  mercy.
GILES: What? Why?
XANDER: I made a mess, Giles. See, I found out  that Amy's into witchcraft? And I was  hurt, I guess, so I made her put the  love whammy on Cordy. But it backfired.  And now every woman in Sunnydale  wants to make me her cuddle-monkey.  Which may sound swell on paper but -
CALENDAR: Rupert. We need to talk. (notices Xander) Hey, Xander. Nice shirt.
CALENDAR: Rupert I know you're angry at me and  I don't blame you. But I'm not going  away. I care too much about you to - (to Xander, feeling his arm) Have you been working out?
GILES: (to Xander) I can't believe you'd be fool enough to  do something like this.
XANDER: Oh no. I'm twice the fool it takes to  do something like this.
GILES: Has Amy tried to reverse the spell?
XANDER: I get near Amy and all she wants to  talk is honeymoon plans.
CALENDAR: Rupert, maybe I should talk to Xander  alone.
GILES: Do you have any idea how serious this  is? People under the influence of love  spells are deadly, Xander. They lose  all capacity to reason. And if what you  say is true, and the whole female population  is affected… (then) <u>Don't</u> leave this library. I'll find Amy.  See if we can stop this thing.
BUFFY: Alone at last.
XANDER: Buff! Give me a heart attack-
BUFFY: I'm going to give you a lot more than  that.
XANDER: Buffy. For the love of God, don't open  that rain coat.
BUFFY: Come on, it's a party. (plays with belt) Aren't you gonna open your present?
XANDER: Not that I don't want to… Sometimes  the remote, impossible possibility that  you might like me was all that sustained  me… (frustration mounting) But not now. Not like this. This isn't  real to you. You're only here because  of a spell. I mean, if I thought you had  one clue what it would mean to me…  But you don't, so I can't -
BUFFY: So - this is all a game to you.
XANDER: A game? I - no…
BUFFY: You make me feel this way and then  reject me. What am I - a toy?
XANDER: Buffy, please. Calm down-
BUFFY: I'll calm down when you explain yourself!
AMY: Get away from him. He's mine.
BUFFY: I don't think so. Xander? Tell her.
XANDER: What? I - I -
AMY: He doesn't have to say. I know what  his heart wants.
BUFFY: Funny. I know what your <u>face</u> wants-
BUFFY: What is this? You're two-timing me?
AMY: "Goddess Hecate, work thy will…"
XANDER: Uh oh.
AMY: "Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!"
XANDER: Buffy!
XANDER: Oh my God.
GILES: Good Lord, what was that -
XANDER: Buffy.
GILES: Where is she?
GILES: Oh my God.
AMY: (glaring at Calendar) Why is she here?
XANDER: Do you think we could focus for one  minute? <u>You turned Buffy into a rat</u>!
AMY: Buffy can take care of herself. Let's  go someplace private.
XANDER: Can you…? I'm not going anywhere  until you change her back!
CALENDAR: You heard him. Undo your magic trick  and get lost.
AMY: Who made you Queen of the world?  I mean, you're <u>old</u> enough-
CALENDAR: What can I say? Xander's too much  man for the pimple squad-
AMY: "Goddess Hecate, to you I pray-"
XANDER: Would you quit with the HECATE!?
XANDER: No more talky from this one.
CORDELIA: Okay. What now? You don't like my  locker combo?
HARMONY: It's not right. You never loved him.  You just USED him. You make me  sick.
CORDELIA: Harmony, if you need to borrow my  Midol, just <b>ask</b>.
GILES: We have to trap the Buffy-rat.
XANDER: Good, Buffy. Just…
OZ: (looking at his hand) That - kinda hurt.
XANDER: Kinda?! What was that for?
OZ: I was on the phone all night, listing  to Willow cry about <u>you</u>. I don't know  exactly what happened, but I was left  with the very strong urge to hit you.
XANDER: I didn't touch her. I swear -
GILES: Xander. Where did Buffy go?
XANDER: Amy turned Buffy into a rat.
OZ: (nods) Oh.
GILES: I don't see her. (to Xander) If anything happens to her, I'll… Just  - go home. Lock yourself away. You're  only going to cause more problems  here. Amy, Jenny and I will work on  breaking the spells. (to Oz) Oz - if you could aid us in finding Buffy…
OZ: Sure. Absolutely.
GILES: Go. Get out of my sight.
HARMONY: You thought you could do better?  Is that it?
CORDELIA: No! I, no….!
GIRL: We'll knock that snotty attitude right  out of you!
KATIE: It's him! It's him!
HARMONY: Stop! Xander! I love you!
GILES: You must have botched the ritual so  that Cordelia's necklace <b>protected</b>  her from the spell. That one should  be reversible. But where did you  learn animal transformation?
AMY: Why did you send Xander away?  He needs me.
CALENDAR: That's a laugh.
AMY: He loves me. We look into each  other's souls.
CALENDAR: No one can love two people at once.  What we have is real.
GILES: Instead of making me ill why doesn't  one of you try to help?
AMY: You don't know what I'm going through!
GILES: I know it isn't love. It's obsession -  selfish, banal obsession. Xander has  put himself in danger and if you  really cared about him you'd help  me save him instead of nattering  on about your feelings. Now let's  get to work. Jenny -
GILES: Damn…
XANDER: I think we-
XANDER: -lost them…
WILLOW: I should have known I'd find you with  her.
XANDER: Will. Come on. You don't want to  hurt me.
WILLOW: Oh no? You have no idea what this  is like for me. I love you so much.  I'd rather see you dead than with that  bitch!
OZ: Hey. Buffy?
XANDER: Now I really think we lost them.
CORDELIA: (genuinely scared) Dammit, Xander, what is going on?  Who died and made you Elvis?
XANDER: There's Buffy's place. Let's get inside.  Then I'll explain.
JOYCE: Xander! Cordelia?
JOYCE: What happened? Why are you all  scratched up? Where's Buffy?
XANDER: She's… around.
JOYCE: Well. Sit down and tell me about it. (to Cordy) Why don't you run upstairs and grab  some bandages out of the bathroom?
JOYCE: (brightly) Let me get you something to drink.  Are you in the mood for cold or hot?
XANDER: I - uh -
JOYCE: I think it's more of a… <u>hot</u> night.  Don't you?
XANDER: Whatever.
JOYCE: Goodness. You are so tense.
JOYCE: Go back upstairs, Cordelia. This is  between us.
CORDELIA: Gross. I think not.
CORDELIA: And keep your mom-aged mitts away  from my boyfriend… Former!
CORDELIA: Why has everyone gone insane?
XANDER: Insane? It's impossible for you to  believe that other women find me  attractive?
CORDELIA: The only way you could get girls to  want you would be Witchcraft!
XANDER: That is <b>such a</b> -well okay yeah, good  point.
JOYCE: Xander? Honey? Let Joycie in!
XANDER: Good. The mob still hasn't found us.  We should be safer up here -
ANGEL: Works in theory…
ANGEL: Where's Buffy?
XANDER: Cordy, get out of here!
ANGEL: Perfect. I wanted to do something  special for Buffy - actually - to Buffy.  But this is so much better.
ANGEL: If it's any consolation, I feel very close  to you right now-
XANDER: Buffy?! How did you-
DRUSILLA: Don't fret, Kitten. Mommy's here.
ANGEL: (furious) I don't know what you're up to, Dru,  but it doesn't amuse.
DRUSILLA: If you so much as harmed one hair on  this boy's precious head-
ANGEL: You've got to be kidding? Him?
DRUSILLA: Now, now. Just because I finally found  a real man…
ANGEL: A real man? I guess I really <b>did</b> drive  you crazy.
DRUSILLA: Your face is a poem. I can read it…
XANDER: Really? It doesn't say - "spare him"  by any chance?
DRUSILLA: Shhhhhh.
DRUSILLA: How do you feel about eternal life?
XANDER: Don't you think we could start with  coffee? A movie maybe?
CALENDAR: There he is!
WILLOW: Get them!
CALENDAR: Mine! He's mine!
WILLOW: All you had to do was love me.
ANGEL: Sorry, Dru. Guess you're not invited.
JOYCE: It's never gonna work for us, Xander.  We have to end it.
CORDELIA: Déjà vu much? Here's another good  reason not to date you. People are  always trying to kill me when I'm  with you! So - what do we do now?  Wait for Buffy to come?
XANDER: I… wouldn't hold my breath.
OZ: (theme from "BEN") "…Ben, the two of us need look no  more… we both found what we  were looking for-"
GILES: Right. You go first.
XANDER: Give me another nail.
CORDELIA: If we die in here I'm gonna kick your  ass! I mean it.
XANDER: None of this would have happened if  you hadn't broken up with me. But  no, you're so desperate to be popular.
CORDELIA: Me? I'm not the one who embraced  the black arts just to get girls to like  me. Well, congratulations, I guess it  worked.
XANDER: It would have worked fine! Except  your hide's so thick not even magic  can penetrate it!
CORDELIA: (quieter) You mean, the spell was for me?
AMY: "Diana! Hecate! I hereby license thee  to depart-"
AMY: "Goddess of creatures great and small -  I conjure thee to withdraw!"
OZ: Buffy?
BUFFY: Whoah.
CORDELIA: Oh god…
XANDER: Get behind me!
GILES: "Diana, Goddess of love, be gone.  Hear no more your siren's song!"
BUFFY: Uh, hi, Oz. I seem to be having a slight  case of nudity.
OZ: But you're not a rat. Call it an up side.
BUFFY: Can you grab me some clothes?
OZ: Oh, yeah. Don't go anywhere.
BUFFY: Really not an issue.
JOYCE: What… what did we -
CORDELIA: Boy! That was the best scavenger hunt  ever!
BUFFY: Scavenger hunt?
XANDER: Well, your mom seemed to buy it.
BUFFY: So she says. I think she's just so wigged  at hitting on one of my friends that  she's repressing. She's getting really  good at that, actually. I should probably  worry.
XANDER: Well, I'm back to being incredibly  unpopular.
BUFFY: It's better than everybody trying to  axe murder you, right?
XANDER: Mostly. But… Willow. Won't even  talk to me.
BUFFY: Any particular reason she should?
XANDER: How much groveling are we talking  here?
BUFFY: A month, at least. This was worse for  her than anyone. She loved you <u>before</u>  you invoked the great roofie spirit.  The rest of us…
XANDER: You remember, huh?
BUFFY: Oh yeah. I remember coming on to  you. I remember begging you to  undress me… And then a sudden  need for cheese. (beat) I also remember that you didn't.
XANDER: Need cheese?
BUFFY: Undress me. It meant a lot to me, what  you said.
XANDER: I would never take advantage of you  like that. Okay, it was touch and go  for a minute there, but…
BUFFY: You came through, Xander. There  may be hope for you yet.
XANDER: Tell that to Cordelia.
BUFFY: You're on your own, there.
HARMONY: Cody Weinberg called me at home  last night.
CORDELIA: Cody? The one with the 350 SL?
HARMONY: The very one. Said he's thinking  of taking me to the pledge dance  on Thursday.
CORDELIA: That's so huge!
HARMONY: Yeah! There's just two other girls  he's gonna ask first and if they  refuse -
HARMONY: Watch it!
XANDER: Sorry.
HARMONY: Excuse me, who asked you to share  our oxygen? God.
HARMONY: I'm glad your mom stopped working  the drive thru long enough to dress you.
HARMONY: That reminds me, did you SEE Jennifer's  backpack? It's so trying to be -
CORDELIA: Harmony, shut up.
CORDELIA: You know what you are, Harmony?  You're a sheep.
HARMONY: I'm not a sheep.
CORDELIA: You're a sheep. Sweaters are  made from your wooly coat.
CORDELIA: All you ever do is what everyone  else does, so you can say you did  it first. And here I am scrambling  for your approval, when I'm way  cooler than you are because I'm not  a sheep! I do what I want, I wear  what I want, and you know what?  I'll date whoever I want to date,  no matter how lame he is!
CORDELIA: Oh, god, oh, god…
XANDER: You're gonna be okay. Just keep  walking.
CORDELIA: Oh god, what have I done? No one's  ever gonna speak to me again.
XANDER: Sure they will. If it helps, when we're  around them you and I can fight a lot.
CORDELIA: You promise?
XANDER: You can pretty much count on it.
