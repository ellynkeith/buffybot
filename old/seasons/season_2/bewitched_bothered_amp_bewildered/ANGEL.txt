Happy Valentine's Day, Dru.
I knew you'd like it. I found it in a  quaint little shop-girl.
Cute.
Here. I'll just…
Done. (to Spike) I know Dru gives you pity access -  but you have to admit, it's so much  easier when I do things for her.
(smiles fondly) Dear Buffy. I'm still trying to decide  the best way to send my regards…

Where's Buffy?
Perfect. I wanted to do something  special for Buffy - actually - to Buffy.  But this is so much better.
If it's any consolation, I feel very close  to you right now-
(furious) I don't know what you're up to, Dru,  but it doesn't amuse.
You've got to be kidding? Him?
A real man? I guess I really <b>did</b> drive  you crazy.
Sorry, Dru. Guess you're not invited.
