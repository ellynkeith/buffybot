Gotcha.
The hands are good right about there…
The name's Cain. <u>I'm</u> the one with  the gun. Which means I'm the one  who gets to do the interviewing.
I got to say, I'm impressed.
Hey, what a man and a girl are doing in Lovers' Lane at night is nobody's-
No, it's funny thinking about you two  catching one! (re: Giles) This guy looks like he's auditioning  to be a librarian. And you, well,  you're a girl.
Uh-huh. (to Buffy) Let me ask you something, sweetheart. Exactly how many of these animals have you taken out?
I tore a tooth from the mouth of every werewolf that I killed. This next one will bring the total to an even dozen.
Well, see, that's the thing. Their pelts fetch a pretty penny in Sri Lanka, and  it's a little hard to skin 'em when  they're alive.
Oh, no. I'm in it purely for the money.
You know, it does bother me. Quite a bit. (grinning) That's why I only hunt them the other three.
No, but the werewolf is. They're suckers for that whole 'sexual heat' thing. Sense  it miles away. But since the little doggie  ain't here, it must have found another place.
You don't know squat? Gee, what a  surprise.
You let it get away.
Chain? What were you going to do, take it for a walk?
That's beautiful. (shakes his head) This is what happens when a woman tries to do a man's job.
Uh-huh. And daddy's doing a great job carrying her bag of Milk Bones. (in Buffy's face) You know, sis, if that thing out there  harms anyone? It's going to be on your pretty little head.
First they tell me I can't shoot an  elephant for its ivory. Now I've got  to deal with People for the Ethical  Treatment of Werewolves.
There you are…
(to himself) That's it. Let me see you…
Now play dead.
No wonder this town is overrun with monsters. No one here's man enough to kill 'em.
