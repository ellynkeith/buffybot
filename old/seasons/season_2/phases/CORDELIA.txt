(exasperated) Excuse me, we did not come here to  talk about Willow. We came here to do things I can never tell my father about  because he still thinks I'm a good girl.
(offended) I've dated lots of guys in bands.
Do you even want to be here?
Because when you're not babbling about poor defenseless Willow, you're  raving about the all-powerful Buffy.
(gently) Xander, look around. I've got my dad's  car. It's just the two of us. There's a  big, full moon. It doesn't get any more  romantic than this. (then) So <u>shut up</u>!
(evenly) What is it now?
Oh, is Willow sending some sort of  distress signal that only you can hear?
Where're the keys!
Got 'em!
It was so awful.
Daddy just had it detailed.
Or it could be a crock.
(to Xander) I think you splashed on a little too much 'Obsession for Dorks.'
(to Willow) You first. I wouldn't want to be  accused to taking your place in line.
Hey, I can't help it if I get the spotlight just because some people blend into the  background.
Sorry, we haven't all perfected that  phony 'girl next door' bit.
I mean, with Xander it's always 'Buffy did this' or 'Willow said that.' Buffy, Buffy. Willow, Willow. It's as if I don't even exist.
And then when I call him on it, he acts all confused, like I'm the one with the  problem.
(nodding) All part of his little guy-games. He's  there, then he's not there. He wants it, but he doesn't want it.
But he should at least realize that <u>you</u> have Oz.
Well, what's he waiting for? What's his problem? (then) Oh, that's right. He's a guy.
Who do they think they are?
(half-crazed) You could be a little more discriminating with that velvet rope!
