WILLOW: Hi.
OZ: That's what I was going to say.
WILLOW: Whatcha looking at?
OZ: This cheerleader trophy. It's like its eyes follow you wherever you go.
WILLOW: So, did you like the movie last night?
OZ: I don't know. Today's movies are kind of like popcorn. You forget about them  as soon as they're done. I do remember  I liked the popcorn, though.
WILLOW: Yeah, it was good. And I had a really  fun time at the rest. I mean, the part  with you.
OZ: That's great, because my time was  also of the good.
WILLOW: Mine, too.
OZ: I'll see you, then. Later.
LARRY: Man, Oz, I would love to get me some  of that Buffy and Willow action, if you  know what I mean.
OZ: Good job, Larry. You've really mastered the single entendre.
LARRY: Oops.
OZ: Yeah, she's actually an evil Mastermind. It's fun.
LARRY: She's gotta be putting out, or what's  the point? What are you gonna do,  talk? Come on, fess up - how far have you got?
WILLOW: Nowhere! I mean, he said he was gonna  wait till I was ready, but… I'm ready! Honest. I'm good to go here.
BUFFY: I think it's nice he's not just being an  animal.
WILLOW: It is nice. He's great. We have a lot of  fun. But I want some smootchies.
BUFFY: Have you dropped any hints?
WILLOW: I've dropped anvils.
BUFFY: He'll come around. What guy could resist your wily, Willow charms?
WILLOW: At last count? All of them. Maybe more.
BUFFY: Well, none of them know a thing.  They all get an 'F' in Willow.
WILLOW: But I want Oz to get an 'A.' And,  ooh, one of those gold stars.
WILLOW: Well he better hurry. I don't want to be the only girl in school without a real boyfriend.
BUFFY: I wish you wouldn't.
WILLOW: How are you holding up, anyway.
BUFFY: I'm holding. (looks at watch) I was going on close to two minutes there without thinking about Angel.
WILLOW: (encouraging) Well, there you go!
BUFFY: But I'd be holding better if you and  Xander and I could do that 'sharing our misery' thing tonight.
WILLOW: Great! I'll call Xander, ask him to join  us. What's his number? Oh, yeah:  '1-800-I'm-Dating-A-Skanky-Ho.'
BUFFY: Me-ow!
WILLOW: Really? Thanks! I've never gotten a  'me-ow' before.
BUFFY: Well deserved.
WILLOW: Darn tootin'! I'm just saying, Xander  and Cordelia? What does he see in  her anyway?
XANDER: But what could she possibly see in him?
CORDELIA: (exasperated) Excuse me, we did not come here to  talk about Willow. We came here to do things I can never tell my father about  because he still thinks I'm a good girl.
XANDER: I just don't trust Oz with her. He's a  senior, he's attractive. Okay, not to me,  but… Oh, and he's in a band. We all  know what element that kind attracts.
CORDELIA: (offended) I've dated lots of guys in bands.
XANDER: (point proven) Thank you!
CORDELIA: Do you even want to be here?
XANDER: I'm not running away.
CORDELIA: Because when you're not babbling about poor defenseless Willow, you're  raving about the all-powerful Buffy.
XANDER: I do not babble. I occasionally run-on. And every now and then I yammer-
CORDELIA: (gently) Xander, look around. I've got my dad's  car. It's just the two of us. There's a  big, full moon. It doesn't get any more  romantic than this. (then) So <u>shut up</u>!
XANDER: Did you hear that?
CORDELIA: (evenly) What is it now?
XANDER: I thought I heard something.
CORDELIA: Oh, is Willow sending some sort of  distress signal that only you can hear?
XANDER: Hunh…
XANDER: Get us out of here!
CORDELIA: Where're the keys!
XANDER: We should be moving! Let's go!
CORDELIA: Got 'em!
BUFFY: And you're sure it was a werewolf?
XANDER: Let's see: six feet tall, claws, big ol' snout  right in the middle of a face like a wolf.  Yeah, I'm sticking with my first guess.
OZ: Seems wise.
XANDER: Oh, and there was that little thing where it tried to bite us.
CORDELIA: It was so awful.
XANDER: I know…
CORDELIA: Daddy just had it detailed.
BUFFY: What's the word on the street?
GILES: (shows headlines) Seems there were a number of other attacks by a 'wild dog' around town. Several animal carcasses were found  mutilated.
WILLOW: Ohh… you mean bunnies and stuff? (then) No, don't tell me.
OZ: (to Willow) Don't worry. They may not look it,  but bunnies can really take care of  themselves.
WILLOW: Yeah.
GILES: Fortunately, no people were injured.
BUFFY: That falls into the 'that's a switch' column.
GILES: For now. But my guess is this werewolf will be back at next month's full moon.
WILLOW: What about <u>tonight's</u> full moon?
GILES: Pardon?
WILLOW: Last night was the night before the  full moon. Traditionally known as… the night before the full moon.
GILES: Meaning the accepted legend that  werewolves only prowl during the full moon might be erroneous.
CORDELIA: Or it could be a crock.
XANDER: Unless our werewolf is still using  last year's almanac.
BUFFY: Looks like Giles has some schoolin' to do.
GILES: I must admit, I'm intrigued. A werewolf?  It's one of the classics… I'm sure my  books and I are in for a fascinating afternoon.
BUFFY: He needs to get a pet.
LITTO: But with some simple basics of self- defense, each of you can learn how to  protect yourself…
BUFFY: Here's a suggestion: move away from  the Hellmouth.
OZ: (explaining) Tag.
XANDER: Would you look at that? He's all  over her! (whispers over) Hey, buddy, you're in a public  forum here!
CORDELIA: (to Xander) I think you splashed on a little too much 'Obsession for Dorks.'
LITTO: …Okay, everyone get into your assigned groups.
XANDER: What happened to you?
LARRY: Ah, last week some huge dog jumped  out of the bushes and bit me. Thirty-nine  stitches. They ought to shoot those strays.
OZ: I been there, man.
WILLOW: (leaning in) Looks like it healed already.
OZ: The emotional scar is still there.
LARRY: Theresa, be still my shorts. We're in  the same group. (smiling cruelly) I may have to attack you.
THERESA: (anxious) No, I think, actually, in our group,  there're a few of us-
BUFFY: (to Larry) Yeah. And I'm one of the few.
WILLOW: Don't forget, you're supposed to be  a meek little girlie-girl like the rest  of us.
BUFFY: Spoil my fun.
XANDER: Be gentle with me.
CORDELIA: (to Willow) You first. I wouldn't want to be  accused to taking your place in line.
WILLOW: Oh, I think you pushed your way to  the front long before this.
CORDELIA: Hey, I can't help it if I get the spotlight just because some people blend into the  background.
WILLOW: Well, maybe some people could see  better if you weren't standing on the  auction block, shaking your wares.
CORDELIA: Sorry, we haven't all perfected that  phony 'girl next door' bit.
WILLOW: You could be the girl next door, too. If  Xander lived next to a brothel!
XANDER: (innocently) Okay, who wants a piece of me?
XANDER: Why…?
LITTO: Okay, everyone, listen up. I want to  show you what to do should you be  attacked from behind.
BUFFY: Unh! Mnh!
LARRY: You're turning me on, Summers.
OZ: That works, too.
GILES: … and while there is no scientific  explanation for lunar effect on the  human psyche, the phases of the moon do exert a great deal of psychological  influence. And a full moon tends to  bring out our darkest qualities.
XANDER: Yet, ironically, also led to the invention of the moon pie.
GILES: (chuckling to himself) Moon pie…
WILLOW: Quite the party animal.
GILES: Quite. It acts on pure instinct, without conscience, predatory and aggressive-
BUFFY: In other words, your typical male.
XANDER: On behalf of my gender: hey!
GILES: Let's not jump to conclusions-
BUFFY: I didn't jump. I took a tiny step. And there conclusions were.
GILES: The point is, our wolf-man could also be a wolf-woman. Or anyone who's  been bitten by a werewolf.
XANDER: (looks at watch) And whoever it is will be changing at any moment.
WILLOW: 'Cause it'll be night soon.
XANDER: So, then. I'm guessing your  standard-issue silver bullets are in  order here.
GILES: No. No bullets. No matter who this  werewolf is, it's still a human being.  Who might be completely unaware  of his, or her, condition.
BUFFY: So tonight we bring 'em back alive.
GILES: Anything yet?
BUFFY: Yes. And you won't believe it! Lisa  Hamm is over there making out with  Tim Bushway! But <u>he's</u> dating Mandy  Donaldson. If she ever finds out- (off Giles' look) Nothing. Not a werewolf in sight. You?
GILES: The same. I thought we might knock  on a few windows, ask if anyone has  seen anything.
BUFFY: (how old <u>are</u> you?) Giles? No one's seen anything.
GILES: Yes. Of course not.
CAIN: Gotcha.
BUFFY: Giles…!
GILES: Hey!
CAIN: The hands are good right about there…
GILES: Who are you? What are you doing?
CAIN: The name's Cain. <u>I'm</u> the one with  the gun. Which means I'm the one  who gets to do the interviewing.
BUFFY: You know, before we get all chummy, could we do something about this 'me being in a net' thing?
GILES: Are you all right?
BUFFY: I could have done without the poking.
CAIN: I got to say, I'm impressed.
GILES: Excuse me?
GILES: You'd be wise to take that back.
CAIN: Hey, what a man and a girl are doing in Lovers' Lane at night is nobody's-
BUFFY: It's not what you think, repulsive brain. (off Cain's look) We're hunting a werewolf.
CAIN: No, it's funny thinking about you two  catching one! (re: Giles) This guy looks like he's auditioning  to be a librarian. And you, well,  you're a girl.
GILES: I assure you, she's more than capable.
CAIN: Uh-huh. (to Buffy) Let me ask you something, sweetheart. Exactly how many of these animals have you taken out?
BUFFY: (hedging) As of today?
CAIN: I tore a tooth from the mouth of every werewolf that I killed. This next one will bring the total to an even dozen.
BUFFY: You're just going to kill it?
CAIN: Well, see, that's the thing. Their pelts fetch a pretty penny in Sri Lanka, and  it's a little hard to skin 'em when  they're alive.
GILES: (incredulous) You're hunting werewolves for sport.
CAIN: Oh, no. I'm in it purely for the money.
BUFFY: And it doesn't bother you just a smidge that werewolves are people 28 days out of the month?
CAIN: You know, it does bother me. Quite a bit. (grinning) That's why I only hunt them the other three.
BUFFY: You looking for a party?
CAIN: No, but the werewolf is. They're suckers for that whole 'sexual heat' thing. Sense  it miles away. But since the little doggie  ain't here, it must have found another place.
BUFFY: (covering) Wish we could help you, but-
CAIN: You don't know squat? Gee, what a  surprise.
GILES: Where are we going?
BUFFY: I think I know where to look. We just  have to make it there before Mein Furrier.
THERESA: Ah!!!
ANGEL: Everything okay?
THERESA: I- thought I heard something.  Behind me.
ANGEL: No one there.
THERESA: Oh… I guess not. I could have sworn-
ANGEL: It's okay. It can get pretty scary out  here, all alone at night.
THERESA: (uneasy) Yeah.
ANGEL: Hey, do I know you from somewhere? Don't you go to school with Buffy?
THERESA: You know Buffy?
ANGEL: I do. Very well.
CORDELIA: I mean, with Xander it's always 'Buffy did this' or 'Willow said that.' Buffy, Buffy. Willow, Willow. It's as if I don't even exist.
WILLOW: I sometimes feel like that.
CORDELIA: And then when I call him on it, he acts all confused, like I'm the one with the  problem.
WILLOW: His 'Do I smell something?' look.
CORDELIA: (nodding) All part of his little guy-games. He's  there, then he's not there. He wants it, but he doesn't want it.
WILLOW: He's so busy looking around at  everything he doesn't have that he  doesn't even realize what he does have.
CORDELIA: But he should at least realize that <u>you</u> have Oz.
WILLOW: I'm not sure I do. Right now, Oz and I  are in some sort of holding pattern. Only without the holding. Or anything else.
CORDELIA: Well, what's he waiting for? What's his problem? (then) Oh, that's right. He's a guy.
WILLOW: Yeah. Him and Xander. Guys.
CORDELIA: Who do they think they are?
WILLOW: A couple of guys.
GILES: (to Buffy) Looks like your hunch was right.
BUFFY: How could a werewolf resist Sunnydale's own House o' Hormones?
WILLOW: The werewolf! It's in there!
CORDELIA: (half-crazed) You could be a little more discriminating with that velvet rope!
CAIN: You let it get away.
BUFFY: I didn't let it do anything. I had the  chain around its neck-
CAIN: Chain? What were you going to do, take it for a walk?
BUFFY: I was trying to lock it up.
CAIN: That's beautiful. (shakes his head) This is what happens when a woman tries to do a man's job.
GILES: Mr. Cain, this girl put her life at risk to capture a beast which you haven't  even been able to find.
CAIN: Uh-huh. And daddy's doing a great job carrying her bag of Milk Bones. (in Buffy's face) You know, sis, if that thing out there  harms anyone? It's going to be on your pretty little head.
BUFFY: (to herself) I live with that every day.
CAIN: First they tell me I can't shoot an  elephant for its ivory. Now I've got  to deal with People for the Ethical  Treatment of Werewolves.
GILES: Let's move out.
BUFFY: Giles?
GILES: Blaerg!
BUFFY: (relieved) Oh. I didn't see you in there. (gets in car) I thought something had happened.
GILES: (groggy) No, no. I'm okay. I was just… I'm okay. (then) Any sign of the werewolf?
BUFFY: No. I'm guessing you didn't see much, either, from that vantage point of having  your eyes closed.
GILES: It's starting to get light. I suppose we should be heading-
BUFFY: Shh.
GILES: Buffy, we're going to get this thing.  We've got another whole night.
OZ: Whoa.
OZ: (into phone) Hey, Aunt Maureen? It's me…  What…?
BUFFY: I can't believe I let that thing get away. Cain was right. I should have killed it  when I had the chance!
OZ: Killed what?
GILES: The werewolf. It was out last night.
OZ: Is everyone okay? Was anyone  scratched? Or bitten?
WILLOW: No, we're fine.
OZ: Gladness.
BUFFY: But the werewolf got someone. Theresa.
OZ: 'Got' as in…
BUFFY: And the worst part is, I could have stopped it.
GILES: Well, we still have one more night.
OZ: (news to him) Another night?
BUFFY: Oh, yeah. And I'm planning on giving  little wolfie something to howl about.
OZ: (taking this in) Hunh…
XANDER: But while we hang out here doing nothing,  there's a human werewolf walking around out there, probably making fun of us.
WILLOW: The way werewolves always do.
OZ: But there's really no way to tell who it is. Right?
XANDER: Sure there is. Giles knows stuff. And I'm  practically an expert on this subject.
WILLOW: On account of how you were once a hyena.
OZ: Xander was…?
WILLOW: Before we knew you.
XANDER: (to Oz) I know what it's like to crave the taste of freshly killed meat. To be taken over by  these uncontrollable urges-
BUFFY: You said you didn't remember anything about that.
XANDER: (oh, yeah) I said I didn't remember anything  about that. (then) Look, the point is, I have an affinity with this thing. I can get inside its head. (acting it out) Okay, I'm a big, bad wolf. I'm on the  prowl. I'm a sniffing, snarling, slobbering  predator. I'm…
BUFFY: You know, he was a little overly gleeful  at the thought of tormenting Theresa.
OZ: Still, that doesn't necessarily mean-
XANDER: (starting out) I'm going to go talk to him. Force a confession out of him.
GILES: Good. Go. In the meantime, let's cover our bases. Willow, check the student  files. See if anyone else fits the profile.
BUFFY: Where are we going?
GILES: If none of that works, I think I've struck  upon a way to finally lay this problem  to rest.
BUFFY: Me and the werewolf, three minutes,  alone in a cage. That's all I ask.
WILLOW: Are you okay?
OZ: What?
WILLOW: You kind of knew Theresa.
OZ: Yeah. I'm trying not to think about  it. It's… a lot.
WILLOW: It is. But we can do stuff to help.  Sometimes it feels good to help.
OZ: Uh-huh.
WILLOW: Like, looking up names? I'll be doing that most of the night. You could help me help together-
OZ: I can't. I'm… busy.
WILLOW: (taken aback) Oh. So….
OZ: I, uh, I need to go.
LARRY: Harris. Geez, next time wear a bell.
XANDER: Why so jumpy, Larry?
LARRY: Geeks make me nervous.
XANDER: Is that really it? Or is there something you're hiding?
LARRY: I could hide my fist in your face.
XANDER: I know your secret, big guy. I know  what you've been doing at night.
LARRY: (calmly) You know, Harris, that nosey-nose of yours is going to get you into trouble some day. Like today.
XANDER: Hurting me won't make this go away. People are still going to find out.
LARRY: All right, what do you want? Hush  money? Is that what you're after?
XANDER: I don't want anything. I just want to help.
LARRY: (skeptically) You want to help. What, you think you have a cure?
XANDER: No, it's just… I know what you're going through. Because I've been there. And  that's why I know you should talk about it.
LARRY: (incredulous) Sure, that's easy for you to say. You're  nobody. But I've got a reputation.
XANDER: Larry, please. Before someone else  gets hurt.
LARRY: If this gets out, it's over for me. Forget  about playing football; they'll run me  out of town. I mean, come on. How do  you think people are going to look at me  once they find out I'm gay?
XANDER: (smiles painfully) Heard you the first time.
LARRY: I can't believe it. I mean, that was almost easy. I… I never felt like I could tell  anyone. And then you, of all people,  bring it out of me.
XANDER: It probably would have just slipped out  even if I wasn't there.
LARRY: No. Because knowing you went through  the same thing made it easier for me to  admit it.
XANDER: The same thing?
LARRY: It's ironic. All those times I beat the crap out of you, it must have been because I recognized something in you that I didn't want to believe about myself.
XANDER: What? No, Larry, I'm not-
LARRY: Oh, of course. Don't worry. I wouldn't do that to you. (leans in; sincerely) Your secret's safe with me.
BUFFY: So, what's the scuttle-butt? Anybody  besides Larry fit the werewolf profile?
WILLOW: There is one name that keeps getting spit  out. Aggressive behavior, run-ins with  authorities, about a handful of violent  incidents…
BUFFY: Okay, most of those weren't my fault.  The other guy started it. I was just standing  up for myself.
WILLOW: They say it's a good idea to count to ten when you're angry…
BUFFY: One, two, three…
WILLOW: I'll keep looking.
BUFFY: I noticed you're looking solo.
WILLOW: Yeah. Oz wanted to be somewhere that was away. From me.
BUFFY: I'm sorry.
WILLOW: I can't figure him out. He's so hot and cold. Or, lukewarm and cold.
BUFFY: Welcome to the mystery that is men. I  think what happens is they grow body hair, they lose the ability to talk about  what they really want.
WILLOW: That doesn't sound like a good trade.
BUFFY: Seems to me you and Oz have some kind of synapse problem. So if you want to  get anywhere with him, you've got to make the first move.
WILLOW: That doesn't make me a slut?
BUFFY: I think your reputation'll remain intact.
WILLOW: It used to be so much easier to tell if a  boy liked you. He'd punch you on the  arm, then run back to his friends.
BUFFY: Yeah, those were the days.
XANDER: Hey…
WILLOW: I'll see you guys later. Cordelia asked me to look over her history homework before class. I think that means I might have to do it.
XANDER: Wow. Those two gals have been  hanging out together a lot. (then) This would be a good time to panic.
BUFFY: How'd it go with Larry?
XANDER: (defensive) What's that supposed to mean?
BUFFY: I think it's supposed to mean, 'How'd it go with Larry?'
XANDER: He's not the werewolf. Can't you leave it at that? Must you continue to push  and push?
BUFFY: Sorry. I was just wondering-
BUFFY: Okay.
XANDER: Okay.
BUFFY: So there goes our lead suspect.
XANDER: You're not boned. You're Buffy.  Eradicator of evil. Defender of…  things that need defending.
BUFFY: Tell that to Theresa. She could have  used some defending before she was  ripped apart by that…
XANDER: (trying to be helpful) Werewolf.
BUFFY: None of the reports said anything about Theresa being mauled. But it was linked to the animal attacks from the other night, so we just assumed werewolf.
XANDER: What else should we have assumed?
XANDER: So that's good, right? I mean in the sense of, the werewolf didn't get her and… (then) No. There is no good here.
BUFFY: Yeah. Instead of not protecting Theresa from a werewolf I was able to not  protect her from something just as bad.
XANDER: Buffy, you can't blame yourself for  every death in Sunnydale.
THERESA: Angel sends his love.
XANDER: Are you okay?
BUFFY: This isn't happening…
XANDER: Buffy-
BUFFY: He's going to keep coming after me. Until…
XANDER: Don't let him get to you.
BUFFY: Xander-
XANDER: Yeah.
BUFFY: I should probably go do it.
XANDER: Oh, no. My life's not too complicated…
OZ: Willow, what are you doing--?
WILLOW: Okay, I had this whole thing worked  out and I had written it down, but then it didn't make any sense when I was  reading it back.
OZ: This really isn't a good time.
WILLOW: I mean, what am I supposed to think?  First you buy me popcorn, then you put  the tag in my shirt, and then you're all  glad I didn't get bit. But I guess none  of that means anything, because instead  of looking up names with me, here you  are all alone in your house doing nothing  by yourself.
OZ: Willow, we will talk about this tomorrow. I promise.
WILLOW: No, darn it, we will talk about this now! Buffy told me that sometimes what the  girl makes has to be the first move and  now that I'm saying this I'm starting to  think that the written version sounded  pretty good but you know what I mean!
OZ: I know. It's me. I'm going though some… changes.
WILLOW: Well, welcome to the world! Things happen. You don't think I'm going through a lot?
OZ: Not like I am.
WILLOW: Oh, so now you're special! You're  special boy-
OZ: Willow, please-
WILLOW: Oz?
CAIN: There you are…
BUFFY: Sorry I'm late. Had to do some unscheduled slaying in the form of Theresa.
GILES: She's a vampire?
BUFFY: Was. Angel sent her to me. A little token of his affection.
GILES: Buffy, I'm sorry-
BUFFY: Not now, Giles. We'll all have  ourselves a good cry after we've  bagged us a werewolf.
GILES: All set. Let's go find this thing.
BUFFY: One question: how exactly do we find this thing?
WILLOW: It's Oz! It's Oz!
BUFFY: What's Oz?
WILLOW: The werewolf!
GILES: Are you certain?
WILLOW: Can't you just trust me on this?! (distraught) He… he said he was going through all these changes, and then he went through all these… changes.
BUFFY: Where is he now?
WILLOW: In the woods.
BUFFY: Willow, it'll be okay. We're going to take care of everything.
GILES: Let's go.
WILLOW: Go where? You're not going to kill Oz?! I mean, sure, he's a werewolf. But I bet  he doesn't mean to be!
BUFFY: Don't worry. We won't hurt him.
GILES: I loaded this with enough phenobarbital to put down a small elephant. It should  be enough for a large werewolf.
CAIN: (to himself) That's it. Let me see you…
CAIN: Now play dead.
WILLOW: Careful!
GILES: Damn…
WILLOW: (disbelieving) I shot Oz…
GILES: You saved us.
CAIN: No wonder this town is overrun with monsters. No one here's man enough to kill 'em.
BUFFY: You know, Mr. Cain, I've been sick  of you since the moment before I met  you. And I've been waiting for just the  right opportunity to take you on. But  then I realized: a big, strong man  versus a girl like me?
WILLOW: (to Giles) Is he going to be all right?
GILES: He'll be a little sore in the morning, but he'll be Oz.
XANDER: This is all so weird. I mean, how are  we supposed to act when we see him?
BUFFY: I'm sure it's weird for him, too, now that we know so much.
XANDER: I know I'll never be able to look at him  the same way again.
BUFFY: Hey, he's still a human being. Most of the time.
XANDER: Who are we talking about?
BUFFY: Oz. Who are <u>you</u> talking about?
XANDER: No one.
LARRY: Let me get those.
BUFFY: (to Xander) What did you do?
XANDER: It really was nothing. That we  should be talking about. Ever.
LARRY: I know. It's just, well…
BUFFY: That was weird.
XANDER: What? It's not okay for one guy to like  another guy just because he happened to be in the locker room when absolutely nothing happened and I thought I told  you not to push!
BUFFY: All I mean was he didn't try to look  up my dress.
XANDER: (covering) Oh, yeah. That was the weirdness.
BUFFY: Weirdness abounds lately. Maybe it's  the moon. It does stuff to people.
XANDER: I've heard that.
BUFFY: And it's sure going to put a strain on Willow and Oz's relationship.
XANDER: What relationship? What kind of life  could they possibly have? You're talking  obedience school, paper training. Oz  would be burying all their stuff in the  backyard. And that kind of breed can  turn on its owner.
BUFFY: I don't know. I see Oz as the loyal type.
XANDER: I'm just saying, she's not safe with him.  If it was up to me-
BUFFY: Xander?
WILLOW: Hey.
OZ: Hey.
WILLOW: Did you want to go first?
OZ: I spoke to Giles. He said I'll be okay, I'll just have to lock myself up around the full moon. Only he used more  words than that. And a globe.
WILLOW: I'm sorry about how all this ended up. With me shooting you, and all.
OZ: That's okay. I'm sorry I almost ate you.
WILLOW: That's okay.
OZ: I didn't know what to say. It's not every day you find out you're a werewolf.  That's fairly freaksome. May take a  couple days getting used to.
WILLOW: Yeah. It's a complication.
OZ: So I guess, maybe, it'd be best if I just sort of…
WILLOW: What?
OZ: You know, stayed out of your way  for a while.
WILLOW: I don't know. I'm kind of okay with you being in my way.
OZ: (taking this in) You mean… you'd still…
WILLOW: Well, I like you. You're nice, and you're  funny and you don't smoke, and okay, werewolf but that's not all the time. I  mean, three days out of the month <u>I'm</u>  not much fun to be around, either.

WILLOW: So I'd still if you'd still.
OZ: I'd still. I'd very still.
WILLOW: Okay.
OZ: Agreed.
