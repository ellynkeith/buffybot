Please. Let me.
Magnificent. I know.
My. Meet the hidden princess.
I think we've made a match, don't you?
Nonsense. I feel quite... moved... to make you a deal you can't refuse.
The world that denies thee, thou inhabit. The peace that ignores thee, thou corrupt.
Chaos. As ever, I am your faithful, degenerate son.

Hello, Ripper.
What, no hug? Aren't you happy to see your old mate?
(proud) It does, doesn't it? Not to blow my own horn, but - it's genius.  The very embodiment of "be careful what you wish for."
(wry) Oh, and we all know that <u>you</u> are the champion of innocence and all things pure and good, Rupert.  (then) This is quite an act you've got going here, old man.
It's who you are? The Watcher? Sniveling tweed-clad guardian of the Slayer and her kin? I think not. I know who you are. And  I know what you're capable of.  (then/realizing) But they don't do they? They have no idea where you come from.
Why should I? What do I get in the bargain?
Ooooh. You're scaring-
And you said "Rupert the Ripper" was long gone...
Say pretty ple-
Janus. Break the statue.
