Great.
I'm supposed to be meeting Devon, but he's nowhere to be seen. It's like he thinks being in a band gives him an  obligation to be a flake. Well, his loss is your incredible gain...
...So then I told Devon - you call that a leather interior? My Barbie Dream Car had nicer seats-
Buffy. Love your hair. It just <u>screams</u> street urchin.
(to Angel) Cappuccino?
So, Buffy, you ran off and left poor Angel by his lonesome last night.  I did everything I could to comfort him.
What's his story, anyway? I mean, I never see him around.
Please don't tell me he still lives at home. Like he has to wait until his  dad gets home to take the car?
Oh, good. I mean- (then) What?
Oh. He's a vampire. Of course. But the cuddly kind. Like a Care Bear with fangs. 
You know what I think? You're  rying to scare me off because you're  afraid of the competition. (then) Look Buffy, you may be hot-stuff when it comes to demonology or  whatever, but when it comes to dating - I'm the Slayer.
Oz. OZ.
That's my costume. Are you guys playing tonight?
Is mister "I'm the lead singer I'm so great I don't have to  show up for a date or even call" gonna be there?
Well, you can tell him that I don't care, and that I didn't even  mention it and I didn't even see you so that's just fine.
NOTHING! Jeez, get with the program.
Xander?
What's going on?
That's nice, Willow, and you went mental <b>when</b>?
Yeah, lucky me. What's with the name game?
No kidding. I was just attacked by Jo-Jo the dogfaced boy. Look at  my costume! Think Party-Town's gonna give me my deposit back?  Not on the likely.
Thanks.
What's <b>that</b> riff?
Who died and made her the boss?
(entering) They don't know who they are, everyone's become a monster,  it's a whole big thing. How are you?
Do you mind?
She'll be okay.
Buffy? Are you okay?
(to Buffy) What is your deal? Take a pill!
(to Angel) She's got this thing where she thinks - ah, forget it. (humoring her) It's okay. Angel is... a good vampire. He'd never hurt you.
Absolutely. Angel is our friend.
Faboo. More clinging.
You guys remember what happened?
(to Angel) I know the feeling. This outfit is totally skin-tight-
Hello? It felt like I was talking. My lips were moving-
I guess we should get them back to their parents.
