Buffy. Excellent. 
I wanted to talk to you about tomorrow night. As it should be calm, I thought we might work on new battle techniques-
Ha, ha. Very droll. I'll have you know I have many relaxing hobbies.
Well. I'm very fond of cross-referencing.
Well, it's interesting -
But not, I suspect, to you. What is it you're after?
Buffy, I don't have time to play games -
She said what?
I, well, um, I don't - a burning hunk of what?
Buffy, I appreciate your interest, but -
A babe? (smiles) I can live with that.
GNYEHAHH!
Right. Okay, then, let's review. At sundown, everyone became  whatever they were masquerading as-
And - your costume?
Yes, but a ghost of <u>what</u>, exactly?
Good heavens. Cordelia became an actual feline?
She didn't change.
And everybody who changed, where did they acquire their costumes?
Hello? Is anyone in?
That's Janus, a Roman mystical God.
Primarily, it represents the division of self. Male and female. Light and dark-
Willow. Get out of here. Now.
NOW, Willow.
Hello, Ethan.
I'm surprised I didn't guess it was you. This Halloween stunt stinks of Ethan Rayne.
It's sick. And brutal. It harms the innocent-
It's no act. It's who I am.
Break the spell, Ethan. Then leave this place and never come back.
You get to live.
How do I stop the spell?
