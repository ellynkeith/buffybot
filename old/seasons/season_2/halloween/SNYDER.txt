You're volunteering.
Ms. Summers. Just the juvenile delinquent I've been looking for.
Halloween must be a big night for you, huh? Tossing eggs. Keying cars. Bobbing for apples. One pathetic cry  for help after another. Well. Not this year, missy.
The program starts at four and the children have to be home by six thirty.
Here's your group, Summers. No need to speak to them -  the last thing they need is your influence. Just bring them back  in one piece and I won't expel you.
