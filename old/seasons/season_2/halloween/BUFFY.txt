Hmmn.
Oh. Hi. I'm...
Rough day at the office. 
(humiliated) Hey. It's a look. A... seasonal... look.
You know what? I need to go... put a bag over my head.
You're sweet. (then) A terrible liar. But sweet.
A date? So did I. But who am I kidding? Dates are  things normal girls have. Girls who have time to think  about nail polish and facials and stuff. You know what I think about? Ambush tactics. Beheading.  (then) Not exactly the stuff dreams are made of.
What's the deal?
Yikes. I'll stick to vampires-
Principal Snyder-
Gosh, I'd love to volunteer, but I recently developed... carpal tunnel  syndrome and, tragically, I can no longer hold a flash light-
Great. I was going to stay in and veg. It's the one night a year that things are supposed to be quiet for me.
Not according to Giles. He swears that tomorrow night is, like, dead for the un-dead. They stay in.
(to Larry) Get gone.
Ooh. Diet.
Saved a dollar?
Oh, that. Forget about it.
Xander -
I think I just violated the guy code. Big time. 
Misfire. I was late due to unscheduled slayage. Showed up looking trashed.
Actually, he seemed pretty un-mad. Which may have had to do with the fact that Cordelia was drooling in his cappuccino.
(worried) Sure. Why would he want a stunning, totally turned-out babe fawning all over him when he could have me - Miss Spin Cycle '97?
But how do we know? I mean, what his type is? Or even what his turn-ons and turn-offs are? I've known him for less than a year and, if you haven't noticed, he's not one to over-share.
Yeah. Too bad. That stuff is private. 
Most importantly, it would be wrong.
(spinning) Nothing! Hi.
You know, Giles, you're scaring me now. You need to have some fun.
There's this amazing place you can go and sit down in the dark - and there are these moving pictures. And the pictures tell a <u>story</u> -
Such as?
Do you stuff your own shirts or do you send them out?
(turning him back) So, how come Halloween is such a yawner? Do the demons just hate how commercial it's become?
Well, of course it's of interest! I'm the Slayer! I need to know this stuff! You can't keep me in the dark anymore! (as he almost turns to the office) Look at me when I talk to you!
Ms. Calendar said you were a babe!
She said, you know, that you were hot. A hunka hunka burning... something or other. So. What do you think of that?
You know, gross as it is for me to contemplate you grown-ups having smootchies, I think you should go for it.
I've overstepped my bounds! It's none of my business. My God, what was I thinking? Shame. <b>SHAME</b>. Gotta go.
Man - look at her.
It doesn't say. But the entry is dated 1775.
So this was the kind of girl he hung around. She's pretty... coifed.
And, clearly, this girl was a workaholic. Willow - I'll never be like this...
Now I feel better. Thanks.
(ignoring her) It must have been wonderful. To put on some fantabulous gown and go to a ball, like a princess... have servants and horses and yet more gowns...
I bet.
I think his parents have been dead for, um, a couple hundred years.
He's a vampire, Cordelia. I thought you knew.
What did you find?
Willow. Can I give you a little friendly advice?
It's just, you're never going to get noticed if you keep hiding. You're missing the whole point of Halloween.
It's come as you <u>aren't</u> night. The perfect chance for a girl to get sexy and wild with no repercussions. 
You've got it in you, Will. You're just scared-
That's not a costume.
Hey, Xander, about this morning. I'm really sorry-
I promise I'll let you get pummeled from now on.
Sorry... It's just, look at that.
It's -
I'm sorry. There's no way I can afford this.
Here. After trick-or-treating. Mom's gonna be out.
Nope. Call it a blast from his past. I'll show him I can coif with the best of 'em. (then) Come on out, Will. You can't stay in there all night.
I won't-
Wow.
Will. You're a dish! I mean, really-
That's the point! Halloween is the night that's <u>not</u> you, is you, but not <u>you</u>, you know?
That's Xander. You ready?
Cool! I can't wait to watch the boys go non-verbal when they see you.
Thank you, kind sir. But wait till you see -
--Casper.
What'd Mrs. Davis give you?
She must be stopped. (brightly) Let's hit one more house. We still have a few minutes  before we've got to get back.
What?
Buffy?
Seventeen seventy five... I believe... I don't understand.  Who are you?
Friends of whom? Your dress is... everything is strange... (panic rising) How did I come to be here?
Demon! A demon!
What does it want?
Where are we?
This... this could be me...
No, I... I don't understand any of this, and I... (re: picture) This is some other girl, I would never wear this... this low apparel and I don't like this place and I don't like you and I just want to go <b>home</b>!
Surely he'll not desert us?
It's not our place to fight. Surely some men will come and protect us?
Surely there's somewhere we can go? Some safe haven?
(to Xander, genuinely confused) You would take orders from a woman? Are you feeble in some way?
I don't know what that is but I'm sure I don't have it.  I bathe quite often.
I don't! I was brought up as a proper lady. I'm not meant to  understand things. I'm just meant to look good and then someone nice will marry me. Possibly a baron.
Fight? These low creatures? I'd sooner die.
But, I don't want to go with you - I like the man with the musket.
Do you have a musket?
What?
(weakly) No... No...
(re: Angel) He's... he's a vampire!
He - really?
Hi Honey. I'm home.
You know what? It's good to be me.
Yeah. You too.
Yeah.
Taa daa. Just little old 20th century me.
I'll live.
I - I just wanted to be a real girl, for once. The kind of fancy girl you liked when you were my age.
What?
You did?
Really. Interesting - like how?
Still, I've had a hard day and you should tell me.
Oh - definitely...
