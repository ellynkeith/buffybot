Sorry. I pretty much repress anything math related.
(smiles) Oh - yeah... I remember now. Weren't there chalkboards and pencils and desks and stuff?
(taps her head) Like a steel trap.
The Sadie Hawkins thing? Isn't that the deal where the girls ask the boys?
Oh... Gosh... I-
It's not you. You seem great. It's just - I'm not seeing anybody. Ever again, actually.
Yeah. I'm gonna stop by the library and see if Giles wants me to patrol. Then sack it.
I play. I have big fun. I came here tonight, didn't I?
You mean that guy? I'm... just not in date-mode right now.
I don't think I'm ready.
Impulsive. Do you remember my ex- boyfriend, the vampire? I slept with him. He lost his soul. My boyfriend is gone forever and the demon that is wearing his face is killing my friends. The next impulsive decision I make will involve my choice of dentures.
Hey! Leave her alone!
What happened? You went OJ on your girlfriend!
Because you're a jerk?
If you weren't fighting - why did you have a gun?
(weakly hopeful) To thank me?
What? I didn't incite! I stopped that boy from killing his girlfriend. I mean - ask them. Ask the janitor.
I'm telling you, something weird is going on.
Pretty much. But this time... I don't know. It bugs me.
Locker monster. Is what he said. But it wasn't really a "monster". It was more like a guy reached out and grabbed him. But when we opened the locker a second time - gone. Nothing.
So we've got some bad boo on our hands?
So - it's like a regular teenager. Only dead.
Great. So now we're Dr. Laura for the deceased.
What?
I don't know. It seems like the fights these couples keep having is sort of... specific. You know?
Great. Glad to know we have this open line of communication.
He misses her. He can't think. Just a little more fallout from my love life.
Yeah, we need some alternate ghost theories. What do we know?
Besides that.
Which is tonight.
(cutting her off) 1955.
Okay. Fresh new strangeness? I dreamt about this woman the other day. Her and this young guy.
(ignoring/still looking at photo) He couldn't make her love him, so he killed her. What a sicko.
Smart?
I feel lousy. For her. He's a murderer. He should pay for it.
No, he should be in prison for sixty years breaking rocks and making 'special friends' with Roscoe the weight lifter.
Considering how violent it is, I'd say it's his.
Who cares what he wants? We gotta shut him down before some other innocent guy shoots some nice girl and blows his brains all over the music room wall.
What's the deal, Will?
I'll take the hot spot. If there's real trouble, it'll probably be there.
Oh, I'm hoping he'll show. I truly am.
Okay, we all have our places. We light the candle and do the chant at midnight exactly. Any questions?
Okay. Let's do it.
"out of house and home - never to come here again."
He wants forgiveness.
Good. He doesn't deserve it.
No. James destroyed the person he loved the most in a moment of blind passion. And that's not something you forgive. No matter why he did what he did. No matter if he know now that it was wrong and stupid and selfish. He's just going to have to live with it...
You're the only one. The only person I can talk to.
You can't make me disappear just because you say it's over.
I don't give a damn about a normal life. (then) I'm going crazy not seeing you. I think about you every minute.
Come back here. We're not finished!
Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!
Love is forever.
Don't walk away from me, bitch!
Stop! I mean it. Don't make me.
Don't talk to me like I'm some dumb-
Grace? But I - I killed you.
It is my fault! How could I let this --
(almost a whisper) Angel... ?
He picked me. I guess I was the one he... could relate to. He was so sad...
I still... part of me still doesn't understand why she would forgive him.
(thinks) No... I guess not.
