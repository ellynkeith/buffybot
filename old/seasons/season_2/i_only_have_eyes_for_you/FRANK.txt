It's my fault. Let myself get behind. (looks at floor) Is it okay to walk here, George? It is... George, right?
Thanks. You have a nice evening.
Yes?
There's no way we can be together. No way people will ever understand, accept it-
(emphatic) No! I just want you to be able to have some kind of normal life. We can never have that - don't you see?
I know. But... (then) It's over. It has to be.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what I feel-
Will that help? Is that what you have to hear? (lying) I don't. I don't. Now let me go!
(carefully) Let's both... just calm down. Give me the gun.
