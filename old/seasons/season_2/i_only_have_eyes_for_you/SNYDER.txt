I'm sure you know why I asked you here.
That's right. I want to thank you. What would Sunnydale High do without you around to incite mayhem, chaos and disorder?
People can be coerced, Summers,. I'm no stranger to conspiracy. I saw JFK. (then) I'm a truth seeker. I've got a missing gun and two confused kids on my hands. Pieces of a puzzle. I'm going to look at all those pieces carefully and rationally. And I'm going to keep looking until I figure out exactly how this is all your fault.
Pathetic little no-life vegan.

I'm doing everything I can. But you people have to realize that - (as people pass) -- backed up sewer line, this happened in San Diego just last week - (they're gone) -- that we are on a Hell mouth. Sooner or later, people are going to figure that out.
I'll handle it. I will.
