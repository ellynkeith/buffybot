I don't see any gun.
Working later, Miss Frank?
Yes, ma'am. You go ahead.
You too. Drive safe.
Oh, Miss Frank?
You can't make me disappear just because you say it's over.
Is that what this is about? What other people think?
I don't give a damn about a normal life. (pleading) I'm going crazy, not seeing you. I think about you every minute-
Come back here! We're not finished!
You don't care anymore? Is that it?
Then tell me you don't love me.
Say it!
No... A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody.
Love is forever.
Don't! Don't do that, damn it!
What - what's going on?
