BEN: Hey. I'm Ben. We had Algebra II together last year.
BUFFY: Sorry. I pretty much repress anything math related.
BEN: Miss Jackson. Second period. You were in the seat three over - one behind.
BUFFY: (smiles) Oh - yeah... I remember now. Weren't there chalkboards and pencils and desks and stuff?
BEN: That's the one!
BUFFY: (taps her head) Like a steel trap.
BEN: So... I was wondering... You know that dance tomorrow night? Are you going?
BUFFY: The Sadie Hawkins thing? Isn't that the deal where the girls ask the boys?
BEN: Yeah. And I thought, maybe, if you're free you might... ask me.
BUFFY: Oh... Gosh... I-
BEN: Hey. No. Don't worry about it.
BUFFY: It's not you. You seem great. It's just - I'm not seeing anybody. Ever again, actually.
BEN: Oh. That's too bad. Okay. Well. I'd better...
WILLOW: Hey. You bailing?
BUFFY: Yeah. I'm gonna stop by the library and see if Giles wants me to patrol. Then sack it.
WILLOW: You've been doing a lot of that. Patrolling and sacking. In fact, you've kinda been all work, no play Buffy.
BUFFY: I play. I have big fun. I came here tonight, didn't I?
WILLOW: You came. You saw. You rejected.
BUFFY: You mean that guy? I'm... just not in date-mode right now.
WILLOW: But maybe you need to date to get in date mode.
BUFFY: I don't think I'm ready.
WILLOW: You're thinking too much. Maybe you should just be impulsive!
BUFFY: Impulsive. Do you remember my ex- boyfriend, the vampire? I slept with him. He lost his soul. My boyfriend is gone forever and the demon that is wearing his face is killing my friends. The next impulsive decision I make will involve my choice of dentures.
WILLOW: Okay, the Angel thing went badly, I'm on board with that. But that's not your fault. (off Buffy's look) And anyways, love isn't always like that. Love can be... nice.
BOY: Come back here! We're not finished!
BOY: You don't care anymore? Is that it?
GIRL: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what I feel-
BOY: Then tell me you don't love me.
BOY: Say it!
GIRL: Will that help? Is that what you have to hear? (lying) I don't. I don't. Now let me go!
BOY: No... A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody.
BOY: Love is forever.
BOY: I'm not afraid to use it. I swear. If I can't be with you-
GIRL: Oh my God-
GIRL: No! Please!-
BOY: Don't walk away from me, bitch!-
BUFFY: Hey! Leave her alone!
BOY: It's... What happened?
BUFFY: What happened? You went OJ on your girlfriend!
BOY: (desperate/baffled) This is nuts... I don't know why I - I got so mad...
BUFFY: Because you're a jerk?
GIRL: He's not. We weren't even fighting a few minutes ago.
BOY: We weren't. I swear to God...
BUFFY: If you weren't fighting - why did you have a gun?
BOY: I don't know. I - I don't even know where I got it.
JANITOR: I don't see any gun.
SNYDER: I'm sure you know why I asked you here.
BUFFY: (weakly hopeful) To thank me?
SNYDER: That's right. I want to thank you. What would Sunnydale High do without you around to incite mayhem, chaos and disorder?
BUFFY: What? I didn't incite! I stopped that boy from killing his girlfriend. I mean - ask them. Ask the janitor.
SNYDER: People can be coerced, Summers,. I'm no stranger to conspiracy. I saw JFK. (then) I'm a truth seeker. I've got a missing gun and two confused kids on my hands. Pieces of a puzzle. I'm going to look at all those pieces carefully and rationally. And I'm going to keep looking until I figure out exactly how this is all your fault.
SNYDER: Pathetic little no-life vegan.
SNYDER: Not so fast, Missy. I'm not done with you yet. You stink of lies.
CORDELIA: Okay. So what's up with Buffy?
XANDER: How many times do we have to go over this? Nothing's up with Buffy. We're just good friends-
CORDELIA: No, I mean, what's up with Buffy? Like, is she okay?
XANDER: Sorry. I'm not used to you addressing subjects not directly related to... you. (then) She's fine. I guess. Why?
CORDELIA: She only blew off Ben Straley - the most eligible hunk in town. He's totally rad and his father owns a department store. I mean, he's the guy I'd be going out with if I wasn't so obviously brain damaged. No offense.
XANDER: Oh no. Why would I be offended?
CORDELIA: Anyway. Ben told Lynette who told Charity - that Buffy wouldn't even give him the time of day.
XANDER: Good for her. She's providing much needed life experience for the refection-deprived.
CORDELIA: The guilt thing's just getting a little old, you know. Everybody's told her what happened to Angel isn't her fault.
XANDER: Yeah. Everybody except the one guy she needs to hear it from.
WILLOW: So for next time, read the chapters on information groupings and binary coding. I bet you'll think coding is pretty cool - I mean, if you find two digit multi-stacked conversions and primary number clusters a big hoot.
WILLOW: (excited) Giles. I made them laugh, did you hear? I did the joke thing!
GILES: Yes. So it seems. I mean - you did. Good show. (then) I was dropping by so if you needed assistance - but you appear to have things quite under control.
WILLOW: Well, I had really good lesson plans. Ms. Calendar had them on her computer.
GILES: Yes, she was... dedicated, wasn't she?
WILLOW: I also found a bunch of files and internet sights about paganism and majic and stuff.
GILES: Oh?
WILLOW: Yeah, it's really interesting...
WILLOW: And - this was in her drawer. She told me it's a rose quartz - that it has healing powers. (then) I thought she'd want you to have it.
GIRLS: Thank you, Willow. That's very thoughtful of you.
MILLER: ... before 1935 the New Deal focused on revitalizing stricken business and agricultural communities...
NEWMAN: Thank you, James. (then) How are you enjoying that book I loaned you? The Hemmingway?
JAMES: I like it. Very much.
JAMES: It's honest.
NEWMAN: I... Yes. It's based on a true story, actually. He fell in love with his-
MILLER: ...to revive industrial activity, the NRA, the National Recovery Administration...
MILLER: ...assigned a number of task forces-
MILLER: Oh! Good God.
BUFFY: I'm telling you, something weird is going on.
XANDER: Something weird is going on. Isn't that our school motto?
BUFFY: Pretty much. But this time... I don't know. It bugs me.
XANDER: I'm not trying to poo poo your wiggins, but a domestic dispute and a little case of chalkboard Tourette's? Sounds like "Hellmouth Lite" to me-
WILLOW: Xander. What did you do - criticize Cordelia's outfit?
XANDER: You're just a big bucket o' funny, Will. I'll have you know I just got accosted by some kind of locker monster.
GILES: (perks up) Loch Ness monster? Really?
BUFFY: Locker monster. Is what he said. But it wasn't really a "monster". It was more like a guy reached out and grabbed him. But when we opened the locker a second time - gone. Nothing.
XANDER: This is right after Buffy's history teacher started doing some freaky channeling thing in class.
GILES: Fascinating. It sounds like paranormal phenomena.
WILLOW: A ghost? Cool!
XANDER: Oh no, not cool. This was no wimpy chain-rattler. This was more - "I'm dead as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore."
GILES: Exactly. Despite the Xander-speak, that's an accurate definition of a poltergeist.
XANDER: I defined something? Accurately? Check me out. (he slams a book on the table shut) Guess I'm done with the book learning!
BUFFY: So we've got some bad boo on our hands?
GILES: Well... A poltergeist is extremely disruptive - and what you described certainly fits the bill.
WILLOW: But why is it here? Does it just want to scare people?
GILES: It doesn't know exactly what it wants. That's the problem. Many times the spirit is plagued by all manner of worldly troubles. But, being dead, it has no way to make it's peace. So it lashes out. Growing ever more confused, ever more angry...
BUFFY: So - it's like a regular teenager. Only dead.
WILLOW: What can we do? Is there any way to stop it?
GILES: The only tried and true way is to figure out what unresolved issues keep the spirit here - and resolve them.
BUFFY: Great. So now we're Dr. Laura for the deceased.
GILES: Only if we can find out who this spirit is. Or... was.
JANITOR: Working later, Miss Frank?
FRANK: It's my fault. Let myself get behind. (looks at floor) Is it okay to walk here, George? It is... George, right?
JANITOR: Yes, ma'am. You go ahead.
FRANK: Thanks. You have a nice evening.
JANITOR: You too. Drive safe.
JANITOR: Oh, Miss Frank?
FRANK: Yes?
JANITOR: You can't make me disappear just because you say it's over.
FRANK: There's no way we can be together. No way people will ever understand, accept it-
JANITOR: Is that what this is about? What other people think?
FRANK: (emphatic) No! I just want you to be able to have some kind of normal life. We can never have that - don't you see?
JANITOR: I don't give a damn about a normal life. (pleading) I'm going crazy, not seeing you. I think about you every minute-
FRANK: I know. But... (then) It's over. It has to be.
JANITOR: Come back here! We're not finished!
JANITOR: You don't care anymore? Is that it?
FRANK: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what I feel-
JANITOR: Then tell me you don't love me.
JANITOR: Say it!
FRANK: Will that help? Is that what you have to hear? (lying) I don't. I don't. Now let me go!
JANITOR: No... A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody.
JANITOR: Love is forever.
GILES: (hopeful) Jenny?
FRANK: (carefully) Let's both... just calm down. Give me the gun.
JANITOR: Don't! Don't do that, damn it!
JANITOR: What - what's going on?
GILES: (aghast) What's going on? You just shot a woman...
ANGEL: ...and this - is the garden.
DRUSILLA: Look. Jasmine.
ANGEL: Night blooming.
DRUSILLA: Like us. (gleeful) Oooooh Angel, it's fairy-land!
SPIKE: It's paradise! Big windows and lovely gardens. They'll be perfect when we want the sunlight to kill us.
ANGEL: You don't like it, Spike? Hit the stairs and go. Take a stand, man.
SPIKE: Our old place was just fine. Until you went and had us burned out.
ANGEL: Things change, Spiky. You've got to roll with the punches... Well, actually, you've pretty much got that part down - haven't you?
SPIKE: Very funny, mate.
ANGEL: What can I say?
ANGEL: I just love to see you smile, buddy.
SPIKE: Yeah. You're a giver.
GILES: It was just like with this couple you encountered the other night, Buffy. The janitor remembered everything. He knew he's killed this poor woman - but he had no idea why. They had no intimate relationship.
WILLOW: And the gun? Did you ever find it?
GILES: No. The police, everybody... We looked all over. (then) I think it's very clear. What's happening.
XANDER: Fill me in, then. 'Cause I've read the book, seen the movie and I'm still fuzzy about what's going on.
GILES: It's Jenny.
BUFFY: What?
XANDER: You think she's the poltergeist?
GILES: Don't you see? She died here under tragic conditions. Now she's trapped.
WILLOW: But - what about the whole deal with the gun? (she glances at Buffy, lowering her voice) Angel didn't shoot Ms. Calendar.
GILES: The gun is insignificant. It's the violence of the thing that matters.
BUFFY: I don't know. It seems like the fights these couples keep having is sort of... specific. You know?
WILLOW: She's right, Giles. The gun, the place... It's like a pattern that doesn't fit with the way Ms. Calendar died.
GILES: Yes. Well. I appreciate your thoughts on the matter. In fact, I encourage you to always challenge me when you feel it's appropriate. You must never be cowed by authority. (quickly) Except, of course, in this instance when I am clearly right and you are clearly wrong.
BUFFY: Great. Glad to know we have this open line of communication.
WILLOW: This is freaky. I don't think I've ever seen Giles be so pig-headed.
XANDER: I know. He's usually "Investigate Things From Every Boring Angle" guy. Now he's "I cling To My One Lame Idea" guy. What gives?
BUFFY: He misses her. He can't think. Just a little more fallout from my love life.
WILLOW: Okay, but this ghost stuff is something else. Let me do a cross check, look for other shootings at the school.
BUFFY: Yeah, we need some alternate ghost theories. What do we know?
XANDER: Dog spit is cleaner than human's.
BUFFY: Besides that.
WILLOW: Oh boy. We know plenty... It says here that a student murdered a teacher on the night of the Sadie Hawkins dance. The rumor was that they were having an affair and she tried to break it off. After he killed her, he went into the music room and shot himself.
XANDER: Ladies and gentlemen - we have a poltergeist. It has to be one of those two, right?
WILLOW: It all fits. The gun. The Sadie Hawkins dance...
BUFFY: Which is tonight.
XANDER: How come we never heard about this murder/suicide thing before? When did it happen?
WILLOW: Well, it says -
BUFFY: (cutting her off) 1955.
WILLOW: How did you know?
BUFFY: Okay. Fresh new strangeness? I dreamt about this woman the other day. Her and this young guy.
WILLOW: James Stanley? (off Buffy's nod) He's the one. He did it.
XANDER: Your dreams are getting wicked accurate, Buffy. You wouldn't happen to see me coming into big cash or, possibly, knowing the love of a woman? In a full-body sense?
BUFFY: (ignoring/still looking at photo) He couldn't make her love him, so he killed her. What a sicko.
WILLOW: He looks so normal in his picture. He was smart, too. He made the honor role.
BUFFY: Smart?
XANDER: He killed a person and he killed himself. Those are pretty much the two dumbest things you can do.
WILLOW: I know, but... don't you feel kind of bad for them?
BUFFY: I feel lousy. For her. He's a murderer. He should pay for it.
WILLOW: With his life?
BUFFY: No, he should be in prison for sixty years breaking rocks and making 'special friends' with Roscoe the weight lifter.
XANDER: Yikes. The quality of mercy is not Buffy.
WILLOW: Whose ghost do you think we're dealing with? His or hers?
BUFFY: Considering how violent it is, I'd say it's his.
XANDER: That tracks.
WILLOW: I've been browsing in some of Ms. Calendar's pagan sites. Maybe I can find a way to communicate with him. Find out what he wants.
BUFFY: Who cares what he wants? We gotta shut him down before some other innocent guy shoots some nice girl and blows his brains all over the music room wall.
XANDER: Okay, who's hungry?
CORDELIA: I hope you guys weren't planning on going to this Sadie Hawkins dance tonight - because I'm totally organizing a boycott. Do you realize that the girls are suppose to ask the guys - and pay and everything? I mean, who's genius idea was that?
XANDER: Obviously some hairy-legged feminist.
CORDELIA: Really. We have to nip this in the bud or things could get way scary-
CORDELIA: Perfect. I'm going to be swollen and scarred. Why didn't it just kill me?
CHIEF: School boy prank?
SNYDER: (shakes his head) Never sell.
CHIEF: Backed up sewer lines?
SNYDER: Better... I can probably make that one fly. But this is getting out of hand. People will talk.
CHIEF: You'll take care of it.
SNYDER: I'm doing everything I can. But you people have to realize that - (as people pass) -- backed up sewer line, this happened in San Diego just last week - (they're gone) -- that we are on a Hell mouth. Sooner or later, people are going to figure that out.
CHIEF: The city council was told you could handle this job. If you feel you can't... perhaps you'd like to take that up... with the Mayor.
SNYDER: I'll handle it. I will.
WILLOW: Remember the plan to contact the spirit and talk to it? Scrap that plan.
WILLOW: Buffy, you're right. The time for touchy-feely communication has passed. I've done some homework and learned that the only solution - is the final solution.
XANDER: Nuke the school? I like it!
WILLOW: Not quite. Exorcism.
CORDELIA: Are you crazy? I saw that movie. Even the priests died!
BUFFY: What's the deal, Will?
WILLOW: Okay. See here? The balcony? That's where the original teacher was shot back in 1955 and where Miss Frank died. It's the hot spot where all the bad mojo is coming from. We need to create a Mangus Tripod- (draws on map) One person chants here, in the hot spot, and the other three people chant in other areas of the school - making a triangle. It's supposed to bind the bad spirit. Stop it from doing more harm.
BUFFY: I'll take the hot spot. If there's real trouble, it'll probably be there.
XANDER: I'm kinda feeling like this ghost is fixating on you, Buffy. The yearbook, the dreams - you sure you can handle it?
BUFFY: Oh, I'm hoping he'll show. I truly am.
BUFFY: Okay, we all have our places. We light the candle and do the chant at midnight exactly. Any questions?
CORDELIA: Yeah. What if this mangled triangle thingy doesn't work?
WILLOW: Oh! I almost forgot. I made us all protective scapulas.
XANDER: Okay... So we can flip the poltergeist over when it turns a nice golden brown?
WILLOW: Scapula. You wear it around your neck for protection.
CORDELIA: You expect me to wear that? It smells like grandpa breath!
WILLOW: Sorry. I didn't have much time so I had to use sulphur. Stinky - but effective.
BUFFY: Okay. Let's do it.
CORDELIA: (scared) No problem. This'll be a piece of cake.
DRUSILLA: Maybe I'll sleep under ground... Dig myself a little burrow.
SPIKE: What about your pretty nightclothes, sweet? They'll get all dirty.
DRUSILLA: Then I'll sleep naked. Like the animals do.
ANGEL: You know? I'm suddenly liking this plan.
SPIKE: Fortunately, nobody cares what you like. Mate.
ANGEL: Oh no? Let's ask Dru-
DRUSILLA: Oooooh! There's a gate... It's opening...
ANGEL: (to Spike) Incoming. I love when she does this.
SPIKE: (ignoring/to Dru) What gate, pet? What do you see?
DRUSILLA: Ummmmm. It's black. It wants her.
ANGEL: Wants who?
DRUSILLA: The slayer. It's time, Angel. She's ready for you now. She's dancing with death.
SPIKE: Big deal. He won't do anything. Our man Angel likes to talk, but he's not much with the action. All hat - no cattle.
ANGEL: I don't know about that.
DRUSILLA: Oh, Angel's got cattle all right. Mooooooo.
ANGEL: Yeah. I think this whole Buffy thing has run it's course. I'm ready to focus my energy elsewhere.
SPIKE: Really?
ANGEL: Oh yeah. What with you being special needs boy, I figure I should stick close to home. You and Dru can always use another pair of hands...
WILLOW: Arghhhhh!
GILES: Good lord, Willow! What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be inside.
WILLOW: Me? What about you?
GILES: Yes, well. I'm trying to -- I think I'm close to contacting Jenny. (re: her scapula) What's that smell?
WILLOW: It's a scapula,
GILES: Ahh. Did you use sulphur?
WILLOW: Yeah.
GILES: Clever. Well, hurry along. There may be some paranormal phenomena if I make contact -- you don't want to get in the line of fire.
WILLOW: Okay. Night.
XANDER: Oh, yeah baby. It's snakalicious in here.
WILLOW: Giles!
GILES: Hold on!
WILLOW: (breathless) Giles..?
GILES: What?
WILLOW: Jenny could never be this mean.
GILES: I know. I- (then) It's not her, is it?
WILLOW: I'm sorry.
JAMES: Get out!!
WILLOW: Oh, God...
WILLOW: "I shall confront and expel all evil"
CORDELIA: "I shall totally confront and expel all evil"
XANDER: "out of marrow and bone"
BUFFY: "out of house and home - never to come here again."
GILES: Run!
XANDER: Check it. I'd say school's out for good.
GILES: Right then... We've definitely established, based on all the parallels and Buffy's visions, that it's James' spirit-
WILLOW: So what do we do, Giles? About James?
GILES: Well - he's obviously reliving the night of the Sadie Hawkins dance, when he killed Miss Newman. It's common for a spirit to do this - to keep recreating a tragedy.
CORDELIA: Hey. If Sunnydale High is shut down forever, do we, like, automatically graduate?
XANDER: (ignoring her) But why? What does he want? (turning to Cordy) Actually, that's an interesting point...
GILES: (ignoring him) He's trying to resolve the issues that keep him in limbo. What those are, I'm not entirely-
BUFFY: He wants forgiveness.
GILES: Yes. I imagine he does. But when James possesses people they act out exactly what happened that night, so instead he's experiencing a form of purgatory. He's doomed to kill his Miss Newman over and over again - and forgiveness is impossible.
BUFFY: Good. He doesn't deserve it.
GILES: To forgive is an act of compassion, Buffy. It's not done because people deserve it. It's done because they need it.
BUFFY: No. James destroyed the person he loved the most in a moment of blind passion. And that's not something you forgive. No matter why he did what he did. No matter if he know now that it was wrong and stupid and selfish. He's just going to have to live with it...
XANDER: He can't live with it, Buff. He's dead.
CORDELIA: Okay... over-identify much?
WILLOW: So what next? Do we go in again?
GILES: Not now. The spirit is too angry. Too powerful... We need to figure out exactly now, and if, this thing can be defeated...
WILLOW: Buffy are you-
WILLOW: Oh, God. Giles. She went back.
XANDER: So - now what? Not even a mega vat of Raid is gonna do the trick here.
CORDELIA: I don't get it. Is she trying to be like a big loner hero or something?
GILES: No. I believe she's under the spirit's thrall. He's calling her-
CORDELIA: But why?
GILES: James needs her to reenact everything that happened the night he killed Miss Newman. He wants to change things. Make a happy ending.
WILLOW: (urgent/to Giles) But it can't ever happen. It always ends the same. Which means Buffy's going in there to get shot, Giles.
GILES: Yes. But remember - the school is deserted. There's no male inside for James to possess. No way for him to play his part.
XANDER: So Buffy should be safe until we can find a way to get her out.
WILLOW: In theory. Yeah...
ANGEL: Not that a sting would do me lasting damage. It's just - tonight's special. I wanted to look my best for you.
BUFFY: You're the only one. The only person I can talk to.
ANGEL: Gosh, Buff. That's... really pathetic.
BUFFY: You can't make me disappear just because you say it's over.
ANGEL: Actually...
ANGEL: I can. In fact-
ANGEL: I just want you to be able to have some kind of normal life. We can never have that - don't you see?
BUFFY: I don't give a damn about a normal life. (then) I'm going crazy not seeing you. I think about you every minute.
ANGEL: I know. But... (then) It's over. It has to be.
BUFFY: Come back here. We're not finished!
JAMES: You don't care anymore? Is that it?
NEWMAN: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what I feel-
BUFFY: Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!
ANGEL: Will that help? Is that what you have to hear? (lying) I don't. I don't. Now let me go!
JAMES: No... A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody.
BUFFY: Love is forever.
JAMES: I'm not afraid to use it. I swear. If I can't be with you-
NEWMAN: Oh my God-
BUFFY: Don't walk away from me, bitch!
BUFFY: Stop! I mean it. Don't make me.
ANGEL: All right. Just... You know you don't want to do this. Let's both-
NEWMAN: (carefully) -just calm down. Give me the gun.
JAMES: Don't! Don't do that, damn it!
BUFFY: Don't talk to me like I'm some dumb-
ANGEL: Don't do this.
BUFFY: Grace? But I - I killed you.
ANGEL: It's not your fault. It was an accident.
BUFFY: It is my fault! How could I let this --
ANGEL: I'm the one who should be sorry, James. You thought I stopped loving you. But I never did. I loved you with my last breath.
ANGEL: Shhh. (then) No more tears.
WILLOW: Look... They're leaving.
BUFFY: (almost a whisper) Angel... ?
WILLOW: Everything seems normal. Not a snake, not a wasp.
CORDELIA: Yep. School can open again tomorrow.
XANDER: Explain to me again how that's a good thing?
CORDELIA: I'm drawing a blank...
GILES: Are you feeling better?
BUFFY: He picked me. I guess I was the one he... could relate to. He was so sad...
GILES: Well, now they can both rest.
BUFFY: I still... part of me still doesn't understand why she would forgive him.
GILES: Does it matter?
BUFFY: (thinks) No... I guess not.
SPIKE: You might want to let up. They way when you've drawn blood - you're exfoliated.
ANGEL: (sharply) What do you know about it? I'm the one who was friggin' violated. You didn't have this thing in you.
DRUSILLA: What was it, a demon?
ANGEL: Love.
DRUSILLA: Poor Angel...
ANGEL: Let's get out of here. I need a really vile kill before sun-up to wipe this crap out of my system.
DRUSILLA: Of course. We'll find you a nice toddler.
DRUSILLA: Want to come, pet?
ANGEL: No can do, Dru. I'm sure he'd be hell on wheels - but we don't have much time. Gotta travel light.
ANGEL: Sorry. Try to have fun without me.
SPIKE: Oh, I will...
SPIKE: Sooner than you think.
