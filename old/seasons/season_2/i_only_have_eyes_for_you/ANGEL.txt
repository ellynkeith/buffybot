...and this - is the garden.
Night blooming.
You don't like it, Spike? Hit the stairs and go. Take a stand, man.
Things change, Spiky. You've got to roll with the punches... Well, actually, you've pretty much got that part down - haven't you?
What can I say?
I just love to see you smile, buddy.
You know? I'm suddenly liking this plan.
Oh no? Let's ask Dru-
(to Spike) Incoming. I love when she does this.
Wants who?
I don't know about that.
Yeah. I think this whole Buffy thing has run it's course. I'm ready to focus my energy elsewhere.
Oh yeah. What with you being special needs boy, I figure I should stick close to home. You and Dru can always use another pair of hands...
Not that a sting would do me lasting damage. It's just - tonight's special. I wanted to look my best for you.
Gosh, Buff. That's... really pathetic.
Actually...
I can. In fact-
I just want you to be able to have some kind of normal life. We can never have that - don't you see?
I know. But... (then) It's over. It has to be.
Will that help? Is that what you have to hear? (lying) I don't. I don't. Now let me go!
All right. Just... You know you don't want to do this. Let's both-
Don't do this.
It's not your fault. It was an accident.
I'm the one who should be sorry, James. You thought I stopped loving you. But I never did. I loved you with my last breath.
Shhh. (then) No more tears.
(sharply) What do you know about it? I'm the one who was friggin' violated. You didn't have this thing in you.
Love.
Let's get out of here. I need a really vile kill before sun-up to wipe this crap out of my system.
No can do, Dru. I'm sure he'd be hell on wheels - but we don't have much time. Gotta travel light.
Sorry. Try to have fun without me.
