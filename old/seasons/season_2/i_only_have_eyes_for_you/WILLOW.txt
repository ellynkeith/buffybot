Hey. You bailing?
You've been doing a lot of that. Patrolling and sacking. In fact, you've kinda been all work, no play Buffy.
You came. You saw. You rejected.
But maybe you need to date to get in date mode.
You're thinking too much. Maybe you should just be impulsive!
Okay, the Angel thing went badly, I'm on board with that. But that's not your fault. (off Buffy's look) And anyways, love isn't always like that. Love can be... nice.
So for next time, read the chapters on information groupings and binary coding. I bet you'll think coding is pretty cool - I mean, if you find two digit multi-stacked conversions and primary number clusters a big hoot.
(excited) Giles. I made them laugh, did you hear? I did the joke thing!
Well, I had really good lesson plans. Ms. Calendar had them on her computer.
I also found a bunch of files and internet sights about paganism and majic and stuff.
Yeah, it's really interesting...
And - this was in her drawer. She told me it's a rose quartz - that it has healing powers. (then) I thought she'd want you to have it.
Xander. What did you do - criticize Cordelia's outfit?
A ghost? Cool!
But why is it here? Does it just want to scare people?
What can we do? Is there any way to stop it?
And the gun? Did you ever find it?
But - what about the whole deal with the gun? (she glances at Buffy, lowering her voice) Angel didn't shoot Ms. Calendar.
She's right, Giles. The gun, the place... It's like a pattern that doesn't fit with the way Ms. Calendar died.
This is freaky. I don't think I've ever seen Giles be so pig-headed.
Okay, but this ghost stuff is something else. Let me do a cross check, look for other shootings at the school.
Oh boy. We know plenty... It says here that a student murdered a teacher on the night of the Sadie Hawkins dance. The rumor was that they were having an affair and she tried to break it off. After he killed her, he went into the music room and shot himself.
It all fits. The gun. The Sadie Hawkins dance...
Well, it says -
How did you know?
James Stanley? (off Buffy's nod) He's the one. He did it.
He looks so normal in his picture. He was smart, too. He made the honor role.
I know, but... don't you feel kind of bad for them?
With his life?
Whose ghost do you think we're dealing with? His or hers?
I've been browsing in some of Ms. Calendar's pagan sites. Maybe I can find a way to communicate with him. Find out what he wants.
Remember the plan to contact the spirit and talk to it? Scrap that plan.
Buffy, you're right. The time for touchy-feely communication has passed. I've done some homework and learned that the only solution - is the final solution.
Not quite. Exorcism.
Okay. See here? The balcony? That's where the original teacher was shot back in 1955 and where Miss Frank died. It's the hot spot where all the bad mojo is coming from. We need to create a Mangus Tripod- (draws on map) One person chants here, in the hot spot, and the other three people chant in other areas of the school - making a triangle. It's supposed to bind the bad spirit. Stop it from doing more harm.
Oh! I almost forgot. I made us all protective scapulas.
Scapula. You wear it around your neck for protection.
Sorry. I didn't have much time so I had to use sulphur. Stinky - but effective.
Arghhhhh!
Me? What about you?
It's a scapula,
Yeah.
Okay. Night.
Giles!
(breathless) Giles..?
Jenny could never be this mean.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God...
"I shall confront and expel all evil"
So what do we do, Giles? About James?
So what next? Do we go in again?
Buffy are you-
Oh, God. Giles. She went back.
(urgent/to Giles) But it can't ever happen. It always ends the same. Which means Buffy's going in there to get shot, Giles.
In theory. Yeah...
Look... They're leaving.
Everything seems normal. Not a snake, not a wasp.
