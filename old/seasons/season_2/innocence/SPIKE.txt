I'm not happy, pet. Angel and the Slayer are still alive, they know where we are, they know about the Judge... we should be vacating.
(glancing over) What's Big Blue up to, anyway? He just sits there.
(wheels around to him) Yeah, it's interesting to me that preparing looks a great bit like sitting on your arse. When do we destroy the world already?
So let's take some! I'm bored!
Yeah, well, we're gonna need more than patience if Angel and the Slayer are-
Dru?
Dru! What is it? DRU!
Darling, do you see something?
Soon as it gets dark, I want you patrolling the street. Plus two  Men on the door and down in the tunnels at all times, is that  clear? I don't want any more surprises.
Are we feeling better, then?
Can't see the stars, love. That's the ceiling. Also, it's day.
Recovered, then, have we? Did you see any further? Do you know  what happens to Angel?
Angel.
You don't give up, do you?
Yeah, uh, Angel... Look over your shoulder.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Don't just stand there, burn him!
What the hell is going on?
Clean? You mean he's -
It's really true?
No more of this "I've got a soul" crap?
This is great! This is so great.
I gotta tell you, it made me sick to my stomach seeing you being  the Slayer's lapdog -
Who cares! What matters is he's back. Now it's four against one, which are the kind of odds I like to play.
Well, she's <b>in</b> the world, so it should work out.
What do you mean?
You've really got a yen to hurt this girl, haven't you?
What do you say, Dru? Do we let him play?
So, you didn't kill her then?
I know you haven't been in the game for a while, mate, but we do still kill people. It's sort of our raison d'etre, you know.
She'd better not get in our way.
I do.
'Bout time.
Have a good time.
(glares at him) I won't be in this chair forever. What if your girlfriend shows up?
