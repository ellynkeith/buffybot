You saw no vampires transporting boxes?
And if the bus station was as empty as the docks and the airport...
Cordelia has a point. If Buffy and Angel were... harmed, we don't stand to fare much better.
(defensively) I would have...
No...
Is the Judge...?
Damnit.
Why didn't you call? We thought...
Buffy, the Judge. We have to stop him.
What can you tell us?
In time he won't have to. The stronger he gets... he'll be able to burn us all with a look.
I'll just have to keep researching, look for a weakness. You all should get to your classes.
Thank you.
He does do that on occasion, no?
Is she going to join us here?
Oh, Willow, did you find the index to-
Any luck with-
Well. Yes. Interesting children.
And we're absolutely certain that Angel has reverted to his former self?
I'm leaning toward blind panic, myself.
I'm sorry. It's just, things are bad enough with the Judge here. Angel crossing to the other side... I just wasn't prepared to deal with that.
(coming near) What things?
If we only knew how it happened...
Well, something set it off. Some event must have triggered his transformation.
If anyone would know, Buffy, it should be you.
Did anything happen last night that might -
Buffy, I'm sorry but we can't afford to... Buffy!
I'm not sure we what we should do about Buffy.
I can't imagine what she's going through right now.
Buffy!
Buffy, stop it!
I'll handle this. You're all dismissed.
For God's sake, calm down!
Buffy, you can't just go accusing everyone around you of -
Jenny...
I don't understand.
But how do you know that you were responsible... Oh.
Buffy, he's doing this deliberately. He's trying to make it harder for you.
What?
Agreed.
She said get out.
And we haven't a bead on where they would go?
It's not over. I suppose you know that.
He'll come after <b>you</b> particularly. His profile - well, he'll strike out at  the things that made him the most human.
No, I'm not.
I don't believe it is.
Do you want me to wag my finger at you and tell you, you acted rashly? You did, and I can. But I know you loved him, and he has proven more than once that he loved you. You couldn't have known what would happen. The coming months are going to be very hard - I suspect on all of us. But if you're looking for guilt, Buffy, I'm not your man. All you will have from me is my support... and my respect.
