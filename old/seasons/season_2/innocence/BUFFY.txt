Angel?
Good morning...
Fun?
Oh. Right. Always fun at Willow's. She's a fun machine.
Not really. I ate a little. I'm just gonna take a shower.
Thanks.
No. What would be wrong?
He didn't check in with you guys?
(nodding) No assembly required. He's active.
He nearly killed us. Angel got us out.
Well, uh, we had to hide... stuck in the sewer tunnels... and with the hiding... we split up and nobody's heard from him?
No, we just... we just split up.
(not convinced) You're right. I'm sure.
I know.
Not much. I just touched him - kicked him - and it was like a sudden fever. If he'd gotten his hands on me -
Also not the <b>prettiest</b> man in town.
No... he'd know better than that. Maybe he needed to... I don't know. I just wish he'd contact me. I need to talk to him.
Angel?
Angel!
Oh, God, I was so worried...
Where did you go?
I was freaking out. You just disappeared...
Well, you didn't even say anything. You just left.
(totally thrown) After... What do you...
What are you saying?
I don't' understand. Was I... was it... not good?
God, Angel, how can you say those things to me?
It is a big deal!
Get away from me.
(a last plea) Angel... I <b>love</b> you.
Then give it to me yourself.
This can't be you...
Angel... there must be some part of you inside that remembers who you are.
Just leave Willow alone. Deal with me.
I should have known. I saw him... at home and he was... different. The things he said...
It's private.
What do you mean?
I don't... I ...
Giles, please. I can't... not now.
(to Jenny) What do you know?
Did you do it? Did you change him?
(ignores him) Did you know what was gonna happen?
And me? What was I supposed to be paying for?
So it <u>was</u> me. I did it.
Curse him again. Can't you do that?
But you did it once, I mean it may not be too late to save him...
Then take me to someone who can.
He's just making it easier. I know what I have to do.
Kill him.
Giles, we'll hit the factory first but we may not find them. If  they're on the offensive we need to figure out where they'll go.
This is good.
Get out.
(all business) Yes I do.
I knew it.
I don't know.
Everybody keeps back. Damage control only. Take out any lesser vamps if you can. I'll handle the smurf.
I think I got his attention...
That was then.
This is now.
My best present ever.
You guys pick up the pieces. Keep 'em separate.
That doesn't work anymore. You're not Angel.
Give me time.
You must be so disappointed in me.
But... this is all my fault.
Some singing. And some running around.
This is perfect.
I got older.
I'll just let it burn.
