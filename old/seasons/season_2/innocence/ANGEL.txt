Buffy... Oh, no...
No... the pain...is gone.
I feel just fine.
Well, he moves to New York and tries to fulfill that Broadway dream.  It's tough sledding, but one day he's working in the chorus when the big  star twists her ankle!
Still having trouble guarding your perimeter, brother. Your boys downstairs are going to wake up sore.
(noble tough guy) As long as there is injustice in this world... As long as scum like you is walking - or, well, rolling - the streets, I'll be around. Look over your shoulder. I'll be there.
Well, you know, it kind of itches a little.
Gee, maybe he's broken.
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Yeah, baby. I'm back.
It's really true.
What can I say? I was going through a phase
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Yeah, destroying the world... great. I'm really more interested in the Slayer.
Give me tonight.
Lay low for a night. Let me work on her. I guarantee by the time you go public, she won't be anything resembling a threat.
She made me feel like a human being. That's not the kind of thing you just forgive.
Be just like old times.
Hey.
Didn't mean to frighten you...
Been around.
What, I took off.
Yeah, like I really wanted to stick around after <b>that</b>.
You got a lot to learn about men, kiddo. Although I guess you proved that last night.
Let's not make an issue out of it. In fact let's not talk about it at all. It happened.
No, you were great! Really. I thought you were a pro.
Lighten up. It was a good time. Doesn't mean we have to make a big deal.
It's what? Fireworks. Bells ringing. A dulcet choir of pretty little birdies. Come on, Buffy, it's not like I've never been there before.
I should have known you wouldn't be able to handle it.
Love ya too. (turns to go) I'll call ya.
Willow? Xander?
Yeah. What's up with the lights?
That doesn't matter now. I've got something to show you.
It's amazing.
Oh, I think I do that.
Wrong. I am Angel. Angelus. At last.
I've got a message for Buffy.
Well, it's not really the kind of message you tell. It sort of  involves finding the bodies of all your friends.
We already covered that subject.
Dream on, schoolgirl. Your boyfriend is dead. You're all gonna join him.
But she's so cute and helpless. It's really a turn on -
Things are about to get very interesting.
You should have seen her face. It was priceless. I'll never forget it.
Of course not.
Nobody knows me like you do, Dru.
Don't worry about it.
Spike, my boy, you really don't get it. You tried to kill her and you couldn't. Look at you. You're a wreck. She's stronger than any Slayer you've faced. Force won't get it done. You gotta work from the inside. To kill this girl... you have to love her.
I love you...
You have to know what to see.
Not really.
But thanks for the offer.
Evil one? Oh, man, now I've got hurty feelings.
A whole lot. Got a lot of lost time to make up for. Say, I guess that's kind of your fault, isn't it?
You gypsy types, you go and curse people, you really don't care who gets hurt. Of course, you did give me an escape clause, so I gotta  thank you for that.
Well, that pesky critter's all gone. So we can get down to business.
Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit... after the first hour.
(to Spike) Too bad you can't come with. We'll be thinking of you.
I'm gonna give her a kiss.
Don't you look spiffy.
(to the vamps) Lock the exits, boys.
(to the Judge) It's all yours.
You know what the worst part was? Pretending I loved you. If I'd known how easily you'd give it up, I wouldn't have bothered.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? Doesn't matter. The important thing is, you made me the man I am today.
Not quitting on me already, are you? Come on, Buffy. You know you want it.
You can't do it. You can't kill me.
