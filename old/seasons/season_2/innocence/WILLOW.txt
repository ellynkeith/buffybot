She never checked in.
No, Xander's right. My God! You people are all... Well...  I'm upset and I can't think of a mean word right now but that's  what you are and we're going to the factory!
Buffy!
Well, <u>some</u> of us were...
No...
I'm sure he'll come by.
You don't think Angel would have gone after the Judge himself, do you?
Okay... No, no he didn't... but I'm sure he'll... Buffy, he probably has some plan and he's trying to protect you... well, I don't know what, I'm not in on the plan, it's his plan... No. NO. Don't even say that.  Angel is not dead.
(into phone) Okay... Yeah, we'll be here. Of course. Bye.
Say hi for me?
She checked every place she could think of. She even beat up Willy the snitch a couple of times. Angel's vanished.
Yeah, but she's extra wigged this time - I guess 'cause of her dreams. God, what if something did happen to him?
Yeah, she's just stopping at home first.
I knew it! I knew it! Well, not "knew it" in the sense of having the slightest idea, but I knew there was something I didn't know. You two were fighting way too much. It's not natural.
Weird? It's against all the laws of God and man! That's <u>Cordelia</u>! Remember? The "we hate Cordelia Club," of which you are the treasurer?
Gee, what stopped you? Could it be <u>shame</u>?
(softly) No. It just means you'd rather be with someone you hate... then be with me.
(sullenly) Hey.
Home. Or, partway home. Then I came back. Now I'm here.
Let's get this straight. I don't understand it. I don't want to understand it. You have gross emotional problems and things  are not okay between us. But what's happening right now is  more important than that.
No.
What about the Judge? Where do we stand?
Let me guess. "No weapon forged..."
Yeah, where's an army when you need one?
What?
What's going on?
Thank god you're okay! Have you seen Buffy?
Show us?
What is it, Angel?
What?
Ms. Calendar, what are you doing? It's Angel.
(terrified) Angel...
Buffy?
Giles, it was just - you wouldn't have believed him. He was so... He came here to kill us!
Are you okay?
Is there anything I can do?
(to Jenny) How did you?
You knew. You told me to get away from him.
Giles, shut up.
What do we do?
(steely-eyes, to Xander) No problem. I'll get Oz. He has a van.
I agree.
I don't think any of us can.
Be careful.
I wish they'd hurry...
Well, we don't' have cable, so we have to make our own fun.
Do you want to make out with me?
With me. Make out. Do you want to?
Forget it. I'm sorry. (beat) Well do you?
What? But... freeze frame...
Do you think he's dead?
