Neither did Angel.
Xander...
Where's Angel?
He didn't say where he was going?
I better go too. I'll go on the net and search for anything on the Judge.
Uncle, I have served you. I've been faithful and I need to know -
Something has happened. Something has changed.
You told me to watch Angel. You told me to keep him from the Slayer. I tried. But there are other factors, there are terrible things happening here that we cannot control.
Angel could be of help to us - he may be the only chance we've got to stop the Judge.
Why?
Then if he somehow has... if it's happened, then Angelus is back.
Buffy loves him.
Unless he kills her first! Uncle, this is insanity. People are going to <b>die</b>.
You're a fool. We're all fools.
Willow, get away from him.
Walk to me.
He's not Angel anymore. Are you?
Rupert, don't talk like that. The kids.
None of us was.
But you didn't know he had turned bad.
What?
Well, I saw his face.
Assuming they don't attack tonight, I think we should let her be.
I didn't know exactly.
I was told... I was sent here to watch you. When they told me to keep you and Angel apart, they never told me what would happen.
I'm sorry, Rupert. Angel was supposed to pay for what he did to my people.
I didn't know what would happen until after. I swear, I would have told you...
I think so. I mean, if you...
The curse. If Angel achieved true happiness, just a moment of... he would lose his soul.
If I could do anything -
Those majicks are long lost, even to my people.
It can't be done. I can't help you.
God...
Do you... is there something I can do to -
I just want to help.
