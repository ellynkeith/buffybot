Nonsense. They'll not disturb us here. My Angel is too smart to face the Judge again.
Angel...
I'm naming all the stars.
I can see them. But I've named them all the same name, and  there's terrible confusion. I fear there may be a duel.
(gets it) Oh my...
Angel...?
You've come home.
Everything in my head is singing. We're family again. We'll feed, and we'll play...
How did this happen?
We're going to destroy the world. Do you want to come?
Yes... there's going to be a river of blood.
You don't want to kill her, do you? You want to hurt her. Just like you hurt me.
You'll be able to hear the screams. I promise.
Oh, goodie!
