I am Ampata.
It is very good.
Please.
(smiling bemusedly) Yes. For many years now.
I have… toured.
I have been taken to Boston.  Atlanta. New York.
I did not see so much.
I listen much.
My old one was much smaller.
Cramped. And very dead.
Oh, no. You have so much here.
They are… (sadly) I am just me.
Thank you. You must teach me everything about your life!
It is just more people than I have  seen in a long time.
No, it is… why are you asking me?
It is broken. Where are the other pieces?
It is very old. And valuable. (thinks for a beat) You should hide it.
Well, I do not know exactly. But I think this represents… I believe  the word is… the bodyguard?
Legend has it that he guards the mummy against those who would disturb her.
I would not know that.
(to Xander) Yes, that will be fun.
Snack food.
Oh, but now I can not try it.
(tentatively) Here goes.
(smiling) You are strange…
I like it.
You protect me. Make me safe.
If you do not, someone could die.
You mean the man with the knife  killed someone?
You are not telling me everything.
Please, understand me. That seal nearly got us killed. It must be  destroyed!
Your investigation is dangerous. I  don't want that. Just normal life.
Why was that so scary?
Then you are very courageous. (then) Can I tell you a secret?
Really.
Really.
I will return to you.
Where you can not follow.
I beg you… do not kill me.
It was unfair. I was innocent.
Please. I am in love.
Yes I do.
I have thought.
What is that?
Of course! I forgot all about it. I will unpack it later.
But you must get ready for the dance.
Why not?
I am happy, too. He has a way of… making the milk come out of my nose.
From making me laugh.
Thank you. You are always thinking  of others before yourself. You remind me of someone from very long ago. The Inca princess.
They told her she was the only one, that only she could defend her people from the netherworld.
You know the story?
She was sixteen. Like us. She was offered as a sacrifice and went to her death. Who knows what she  gave up to fulfill her duty to others. What chance of love?
Hello, Xander.
I tried. She's very stubborn.
Well, good-bye, then.
I love your costume. It's very authentic.
I would love to dance.
Do I look like I am with Xander?
Because I… I do not deserve you.
I am very happy. And very sad.
I can't!
Looks like you've been keeping  some secrets from me.
I shared your life-
--Now you'll share my death.
This won't hurt.
Xander, we can be together. Just  let me have this one.
I must do this, now, or it is the end. For me and for us.
Yes.
