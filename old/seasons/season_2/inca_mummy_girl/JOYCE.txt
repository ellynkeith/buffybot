Buffy, do you want to show Ampata up to your room?
That was when we thought Ampata was a boy. But since he's a girl, I  thought you could double up.
You two in a room together? Give  you both a chance to share secrets.
Oh, it'll be fun.
Ampata, don't you look wonderful. I wish you could talk my daughter into going with you.
I'm glad someone else sees that.
