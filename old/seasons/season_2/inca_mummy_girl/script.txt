BUFFY: It's so unfair.
WILLOW: I don't think it's that bad.
BUFFY: It's the uber-suck! Mom could have at least warned me!
XANDER: Well, a lot of the parents are doing it this year. It's part of this whole cultural exchange magilla. The  exhibit, the dance…
WILLOW: I have the best costume for the dance.
BUFFY: A complete stranger in my house  for two weeks! I'm gonna be insane! A danger to myself and others within three days, I swear.
XANDER: I think the exchange student program is cool. (off their looks) I do. It's the beautiful melding of  two cultures.
BUFFY: Have you ever done an exchange program?
XANDER: My dad tried to sell me to some Armenians once, does that count?
CORDELIA: (pointing) There's mine. Sven. Isn't he lunchable?  Mine's definitely the best.
BUFFY: Whatcha looking at?
CORDELIA: Pictures of our exchange students. (shows a picture) Look. One hundred percent Swedish. One hundred percent gorgeous. One hundred percent staying in my house.
CORDELIA: Buffy, how's yours? Visually, I mean.
BUFFY: I don't know. Guy-like.
XANDER: By 'guy-like,' you mean a big,  beefy, guy-like girl, right?
BUFFY: I was just told 'guy.'
CORDELIA: You didn't even look at him first? He could be dogly! You live on  the edge.
XANDER: Hold on a sec. This person living in  your house for two weeks is a man, with man parts? This is a terrible idea!
WILLOW: What about the beautiful melding of  two cultures?
XANDER: There's no melding. Okay? He can keep his parts to himself.
BUFFY: (looking off) What's he doing?
XANDER: Rodney Munson. God's gift to the  bell curve.
WILLOW: You just don't like him 'cause of that time he beat you up every  day for five years.
XANDER: Yeah, I'm irrational that way.
BUFFY: Maybe I should stop him before he gets in -
WILLOW: I got it. The non-violent approach is probably better here.
BUFFY: I wasn't gonna use violence. I  don't always use violence. Do I?
XANDER: The important thing is, you believe that.
BUFFY: I might have used reason. Or my  feminine wiles.
RODNEY: (snarling) Wha'd you… (then, seeing her) Oh, Willow. Hi.
WILLOW: (re: knife) That's probably not something you're supposed to be doing. You could get in trouble.
RODNEY: (mock horror) Oh, no. And they might kick me out of school?
WILLOW: We still on for our Chem tutorial tomorrow?
RODNEY: Yeah. I think I got almost all 14  natural elements memorized.
WILLOW: There are 103.
RODNEY: Oh. So I still got to learn… (calculating) Uh…
WILLOW: We'll do a touch-up on math, too.
RODNEY: Thanks.
GUIDE: Welcome students. We shall now Proceed into the Incan Burial Chamber. (ominously) The human sacrifice is about to begin.
XANDER: Typical museum trick. Promise human sacrifice, deliver old pots and pans.
GUIDE: 500 years ago, the Incan people chose a beautiful teenage girl to become their princess…
WILLOW: I hope this story ends with 'And she lived happily ever after.'
XANDER: No. I think the story ends with, 'And  she became a scary, discolored, shriveled mummy.'
GUIDE: The Incan people sacrificed their  princess to the mountain, god, Sebancaya. An offering, buried alive, for eternity in this dark tomb.
WILLOW: They could have at least wrapped  it in nice white bandages, like the  ones in the movies.
GUIDE: The Princess remained there,  protected only by a cursed seal,  placed there as a warning to any  who would wake her.
XANDER: So, Buffy, when's exchange-o boy making his appearance?
BUFFY: His name is Ampata. He's showing up at the bus station tomorrow night.
XANDER: Ooh, Sunnydale bus depot. Classy.  What better way to say "Welcome  to Our Country" than with the  stench of urine.
GUIDE: If you'll follow me this way…
RODNEY: Cool…
BUFFY: So, can I go?
BUFFY: How come?
GILES: Because you are the Chosen One.
BUFFY: Just this once, can't I be the  Overlooked One?
GILES: I'm afraid that's simply not an option. You have responsibilities that other girls do not, and -
BUFFY: (sarcastic) Oh, I can finish this one for you. 'Slaying entails certain sacrifices  blah blah blah-bity blah I'm so  stuffy give me a scone.'
GILES: (witheringly) It's like you know me.
XANDER: Not with her. In the same house as  her. Am I the only one who's  objective enough to make that  distinction.?
BUFFY: (to Giles) So then, going to the dance, like a  normal person, is the best way to  keep that secret.
GILES: (trapped) You're twisting my words.
BUFFY: No, I'm just using them for good.
GILES: Fine. Go.
BUFFY: (smiling) Yay! I win!
GILES: I think I'll go introduce my shoulder  to an ice pack.
XANDER: So, we're dance-bound. I think I can  get mom's car, so I'm the wheel man.
BUFFY: I thought you were taking Willow.
XANDER: Well, I'm gonna take Willow, but I'm  not gonna take Willow. In the sense of "take me." See with you, we're  three and everybody's safe. Without you, we're two.
BUFFY: And we enter dateville. Romance.  Flowers.
XANDER: Lips.
BUFFY: C'mon. All the years you've known Willow, you've never thought about her lips?
XANDER: Buffy, I love Willow.
XANDER: Willow. Hi. We were just talking  about happy things. Like all three of us going to the dance together. See? Happy. (then, worried) Not happy?
WILLOW: No. Yes. (recovering) Rodney's missing.
GILES: Trouble with Mr. Munson again?
WILLOW: His parents said he never came home last night. The police are still looking for him.
XANDER: 'Police are looking for Rodney Munson.' That's a phrase we'll get used to.
BUFFY: I don't remember him on the bus back from the field trip.
WILLOW: I don't either. I hope he didn't get into trouble at the museum.
XANDER: (picking up on it) Maybe he awakened the mummy-
WILLOW: Right, and it rose from its tomb…
BUFFY: And attacked him…
WILLOW: (hopeful) On the other hand, maybe Rodney  just went out for a smoke.
XANDER: For twenty-one hours?
WILLOW: It's addictive, you know.
GILES: We'll consider that idea, the moment  we've ruled out evil curses.
BUFFY: Some day I'm going to live in a town where evil curses are just generally  ruled out without even saying.
GILES: Where was this seal?
BUFFY: Here. And it's broken.
WILLOW: Does that mean the mummy's loose?
BUFFY: Nope. Still there. Comfy as every.
GILES: (studies the fragment) Look at this. A series of  pictograms…
XANDER: Okay. I just saved us, right?
BUFFY: Something did.
GILES: Let's not fret the details. Let's just go. Xander, bring the fragment.
BUFFY: Willow? What is it?
WILLOW: Giles. Were the Incans… very  advanced?
GILES: Yes. Yes, they were.
WILLOW: (small voice) Did they have orthodontists?
WILLOW: Rodney looked like he had been dead for five hundred years. How could  that be?
XANDER: Maybe we should ask that crazy man with the big ol' knife.
BUFFY: He didn't seem overly chatty.
WILLOW: The way he bolted when he saw Rodney, I'd say he was as freaked as we were.
GILES: I'm afraid my volumes are useless. This particular mummy was from the  Sebancaya region of eastern Peru. Very remote. If there's an answer, it's locked-
BUFFY: In the seal.
GILES: It could take me weeks to translate these pictograms. Well, we'll start tonight with -
BUFFY: (suddenly) Ampata!
GILES: I was going to suggest hunting.
BUFFY: (starting out) I'm late. I told my mom I'd pick him up.
XANDER: Buffy, where are your priorities? In tracking down a mummifying murderer, or making time with some Latin lover,  whose stock in trade is the breakage of hearts?
BUFFY: Ampata is there alone and I don't know how good his English is. He's- (realizing) --from South America! Maybe he could translate the seal.
XANDER: Oh, sure. Fall for the old 'Let-me- translate-that-ancient-seal-for-you'  come one. You know how many times I've used that?
BUFFY: Forty minutes late. Welcome to America.
WILLOW: What if he left already.
BUFFY: (calling) Ampata? Ampata Duarte?
XANDER: Do we have to speak Spanish when we see him? 'Cause I don't know how to  say anything much besides "Doritos" and "Chihuahua".
BUFFY: Ampata?
AMPATA: I am Ampata.
XANDER: (quietly) Hay carumba. I also know how  to say that.
BUFFY: And this is the kitchen…
AMPATA: It is very good.
BUFFY: Oh yeah. Got your stove, your fridge… fully functional. We're very into it.
XANDER: Do you want something to drink?
BUFFY: (looking into fridge) We've got milk and … older milk… Oh. Juice?
AMPATA: Please.
WILLOW: So, Ampata… You're a girl.
AMPATA: (smiling bemusedly) Yes. For many years now.
WILLOW: And not a boy. 'Cause we thought  that a boy was coming, and here  you are in a girl way.
XANDER: It's just one of those crazy mix ups, Will.
BUFFY: Have you been to America before.
AMPATA: I have… toured.
XANDER: (as to a child) Where did… you go?
AMPATA: I have been taken to Boston.  Atlanta. New York.
WILLOW: New York. That's exciting. What  was that like?
AMPATA: I did not see so much.
XANDER: Your English is very bueno.  Muy good.
AMPATA: I listen much.
XANDER: Well, that works out great, 'cause I talk much!
JOYCE: Buffy, do you want to show Ampata up to your room?
BUFFY: Excuse me?
BUFFY: You said she was staying in the study.
JOYCE: That was when we thought Ampata was a boy. But since he's a girl, I  thought you could double up.
BUFFY: Mom, you think too much.
JOYCE: You two in a room together? Give  you both a chance to share secrets.
BUFFY: I'm not a big secret sharer. I like my secrets. They're secret.
JOYCE: Oh, it'll be fun.
BUFFY: Fun. Yeah. (smiling) You know, next year I ought to sign up for one of those 'exchange mom' programs.
BUFFY: Sorry about the teenyness of the room.
AMPATA: My old one was much smaller.
BUFFY: What's it like, back home?
AMPATA: Cramped. And very dead.
BUFFY: You'll feel right at home in Sunnydale.
AMPATA: Oh, no. You have so much here.
BUFFY: How about friends?
AMPATA: They are… (sadly) I am just me.
BUFFY: I've been there. (brightening) But, hey. You'll meet lots of  people tomorrow.
AMPATA: Thank you. You must teach me everything about your life!
BUFFY: One normal life, coming up.
CORDELIA: Devon, I told you I'd be at the dance tonight, but I'm not one of your little groupies. I won't be all doe-eyed,  looking up at you, standing at the  edge of the stage.
DEVON: Got it.
CORDELIA: So, I'll see you afterwards?
DEVON: Sure. Where do you want to meet?
CORDELIA: I'll be standing at the edge of the stage.
DEVON: With that guy?
DEVON: Oz, man, what do you think?
OZ: Of what?
DEVON: Of Cordelia, man.
OZ: She's a wonderland tour.
DEVON: You gotta admit, she's hot.
OZ: Oh, yeah. Hot girl.
DEVON: Let me guess. Not your type. What does girl have to do to impress you?
OZ: Well, it involves a feather boa and  the theme from A Summer Place. I can't discuss it here.
DEVON: You're too picky, man. You know how many girls you could have? You're  lead guitar, Oz, that's currency!
OZ: I'm not picky. You're just impressed by any pretty girl that can walk and talk.
DEVON: (innocently) She doesn't have to talk…
WILLOW: I worked really hard on my costume. It's pretty cool.
XANDER: Okay, but what about me? I gotta think.
WILLOW: It's a celebration of cultures. There's  a lot of dress-up alternatives.
XANDER: And a corresponding equal number of mocking alternatives, all aimed at me.
WILLOW: Bavarians are cool.
XANDER: No hats with feathers, no ruffled Shirts and definitely no lederhosen. They make my calves look fat.
WILLOW: Why are you suddenly so worried about looking like an idiot? (a beat) That came out wrong.
BUFFY: Your first day of school. Nervous?
AMPATA: It is just more people than I have  seen in a long time.
BUFFY: Don't worry. You're not going to have any problem making friends. As a  matter of fact, I know someone who's dying to meet you.
GILES: How do you do? I was wondering if you could translate this for me.
BUFFY: That was in no way awkward.
AMPATA: No, it is… why are you asking me?
GILES: It's an artifact. From your region.  It's from the tomb of an Incan mummy. We're trying to translate it. A project  for our…
WILLOW: Archaeology Club.
XANDER: 'Ar-chae-ol-o-gy.' Study of old stuff.
AMPATA: It is broken. Where are the other pieces?
BUFFY: This is the only one we found.
AMPATA: It is very old. And valuable. (thinks for a beat) You should hide it.
GILES: Is there anything you recognize here? (pointing) This figure with the knife, for instance.
AMPATA: Well, I do not know exactly. But I think this represents… I believe  the word is… the bodyguard?
GILES: (nodding) Bodyguard. Interesting.
AMPATA: Legend has it that he guards the mummy against those who would disturb her.
BUFFY: By slicing them up?
AMPATA: I would not know that.
GILES: Yes, well. That should be a good  starting point for our… club.
BUFFY: Oh, right. And as Club President, I  have to do lots of stuff. Very  dull stuff. (re: Ampata) Willow, maybe you could-
XANDER: --stay with Ampata for the day?  I'd love to.
AMPATA: (to Xander) Yes, that will be fun.
GILES: Okay, then. I'll continue with the translating. Buffy, you research  this 'Bodyguard.' And… Willow?
WILLOW: Boy. They really like each other.
XANDER: And this- (pulls something out) --is called snack food.
AMPATA: Snack food.
XANDER: (unwrapping) It's a delicious, golden, spongy cake, filled with a delightful, white creamy substance of goodness. And here's how you eat it.
AMPATA: Oh, but now I can not try it.
XANDER: (with mouth full) That's why you bring two.
AMPATA: (tentatively) Here goes.
XANDER: Good, huh? And the exciting part is, they have no ingredients that a human can pronounce. So they don't leave you with that heavy, food feeling in your  stomach.
AMPATA: (smiling) You are strange…
XANDER: Girls always tell me that. Right before they run away.
AMPATA: I like it.
XANDER: I like you like it. (thinks about that) Please don't learn from my English.
BUFFY: Hah! Or possibly Hah… do you  think this matches?
WILLOW: Oh! Yes! I'm caring about mummies.
BUFFY: (sympathetically) Ampata's only staying for two weeks.
WILLOW: And then Xander will find someone else who's not me to obsess about. At least with you I knew he didn't  have a shot.
BUFFY: I'm sorry.
WILLOW: (brave face) Well, you know, I have a choice. I can spend my life waiting for Xander to go with every other girl in the world before he notices me, or I can just get  on with my life.
BUFFY: Good for you.
WILLOW: Well, I didn't choose yet…
GILES: Aha. Yes. Good work?
BUFFY: My work?
GILES: Yes. This makes it clear: Rodney's  killer is the mummy.
WILLOW: Where's it say that?
GILES: Here. It explains that mummies kill by feeding off the life force of a  person. Effectively freeze-drying  them, you might say.
BUFFY: So then, we just have to stop the  mummy. Which leaves the question: How do we a: find and b: stop the  mummy?
GILES: (re: Seal fragment) That answer is still locked somewhere in here. Or in the rest of the seal.
MAN: You stole the seal. Where is it?
XANDER: Come on!
XANDER: Are you okay?
AMPATA: You protect me. Make me safe.
BUFFY: So, our bodyguard strikes again. Why  is he so into us? What's he want?
XANDER: He said "give me the seal."
GILES: Apparently, this seal fragment is  even more popular than we realized. I'm just not sure what we should do  with it.
AMPATA: If you do not, someone could die.
GILES: I'm afraid someone already has.
AMPATA: You mean the man with the knife  killed someone?
BUFFY: No, not-I mean, he…
AMPATA: You are not telling me everything.
XANDER: You're right, Ampata. And it's time we do. We're not in Archaeology  Club. We're in-
AMPATA: Please, understand me. That seal nearly got us killed. It must be  destroyed!
XANDER: Ampata!
XANDER: Ampata, listen to me. Nobody's going  to hurt you. I won't let them.
AMPATA: Your investigation is dangerous. I  don't want that. Just normal life.
WILLOW: Is she okay?
XANDER: Wigged. I wanna convince her that our lives aren't just danger and peril here.
WILLOW: You should take her to the dance.
XANDER: Yeah, that'll be fun. We can all…
WILLOW: I mean just you.
XANDER: But you were all psyched… your costume.
WILLOW: I'll see you there.
XANDER: Thanks. You know what, Willow?  You're my best friend.
WILLOW: (to herself) I know.
BUFFY: Why would the Bodyguard have such  a jones for a broken piece of rock?
GILES: He probably needs this to put with  the other pieces-
BUFFY: At the museum.
GILES: Precisely. We'll go to the museum and  use this fragment as bait to lure in the Bodyguard.
BUFFY: And he'll lead us to mummy dearest. (smiling) Hey, look at us. We came up with a  plan. A good plan.
GILES: We can meet there tonight after the museum is closed.
BUFFY: No! Bad plan! I have other plans. Dance plans. (off his look; solemnly) Cancel plans.
XANDER: Okay. I have something to tell you. It's kind of a secret. And a little  bit scary.
AMPATA: Why was that so scary?
XANDER: Well, because you never know if the  girl is going to say yes, or if she's  going to laugh in your face, pull out your still-beating heart, and crush it into the ground with her heel.
AMPATA: Then you are very courageous. (then) Can I tell you a secret?
XANDER: Really?
AMPATA: Really.
XANDER: That's great! Really?
AMPATA: Really.
XANDER: That's great! (then) You're not a praying mantis, are you? (off her) Sorry. Someone else.
AMPATA: I will return to you.
XANDER: Where are you going?
AMPATA: Where you can not follow.
XANDER: Hey, I'll follow you anywhere you go - (sees WOMEN'S RESTROOM sign) -except for not in there. I'll wait outside.
AMPATA: I beg you… do not kill me.
MAN: You are already dead. For 500 years.
AMPATA: It was unfair. I was innocent.
MAN: The people that you kill now so that you may live - they are innocent.
AMPATA: Please. I am in love.
MAN: You are the Chosen One. You must  die. You have no choice.
AMPATA: Yes I do.
AMPATA: I have thought.
BUFFY: Should be on the dresser.
AMPATA: What is that?
BUFFY: They sent your stuff from the station.
AMPATA: Of course! I forgot all about it. I will unpack it later.
BUFFY: I can do it.
AMPATA: But you must get ready for the dance.
BUFFY: I'm not going.
AMPATA: Why not?
BUFFY: I've got work to do. There are some bad things happening out there. That guy with the knife is only one of them.
XANDER: I am not worried. Thanks to Xander.
BUFFY: He seems very happy around you.
AMPATA: I am happy, too. He has a way of… making the milk come out of my nose.
BUFFY: And that's good?
AMPATA: From making me laugh.
BUFFY: I'll help you look.
AMPATA: Thank you. You are always thinking  of others before yourself. You remind me of someone from very long ago. The Inca princess.
BUFFY: A princess? Cool.
AMPATA: They told her she was the only one, that only she could defend her people from the netherworld.
BUFFY: --chosen.
AMPATA: You know the story?
BUFFY: It's fairly familiar.
AMPATA: She was sixteen. Like us. She was offered as a sacrifice and went to her death. Who knows what she  gave up to fulfill her duty to others. What chance of love?
BUFFY: Who knows?
BUFFY: Xander and Willow. I'll get it.
XANDER: I have come for the dance.
BUFFY: What culture are you?
XANDER: I am from the country of Leone. It's in Italy, pretending to be Montana. (then, re: her sweats) And what are you? From the country  of white trash?
BUFFY: New line-up. You and Willow are  taking Ampata, Giles and I are  hunting mummies. (then) Where's you and Willow?
XANDER: She's not coming. With us.
BUFFY: Oh. On a date. Romance. Lips.
AMPATA: Hello, Xander.
XANDER: Uh, ngh…bff…
BUFFY: I can translate America Salivating  Boy-talk. He said you're beautiful.
XANDER: (to Buffy) Cch… krl…
BUFFY: You're welcome.
JOYCE: Ampata, don't you look wonderful. I wish you could talk my daughter into going with you.
AMPATA: I tried. She's very stubborn.
JOYCE: I'm glad someone else sees that.
AMPATA: Well, good-bye, then.
XANDER: Be careful.
BUFFY: I will.  (then) And Xander? You look good.
BUFFY: Yeah. How about that?
CORDELIA: Ooh, what a near faux-pas. I almost wore the same thing.
GWEN: Where's Sven?
CORDELIA: I keep trying to ditch him, but he's  like one of those dogs you leave at the Grand Canyon on vacation, it  follows you back across four states.
GWEN: He's kind of cute. Maybe it's nice, skipping the small talk.
CORDELIA: Small talk? Try simple instructions. (gestures to Sven) Get punch-y? You? Fruit drinky?
GWEN: He can follow me.
WILLOW: I guess I should have worn something sexy.
AMPATA: I love your costume. It's very authentic.
WILLOW: Thanks.
XANDER: Yeah. You look… snug.
WILLOW: That's what I was going for. (tries to look around) Where's Buffy?
BUFFY: Yep. Not at the dance. Not with my friends. Not with a life. (then) What are you doing here? I thought we were going to meet at the museum to find the bodyguard?
GILES: I'm afraid he's already been found.  In a school restroom. Mummified.
BUFFY: I don't get it. Why would the mummy kill his own bodyguard?
GILES: Because he wasn't the mummy's  bodyguard.
BUFFY: Not a bodyguard, then.
GILES: More like a prison guard.
BUFFY: So Ampata translated wrong?
GILES: Maybe we should get her to take  another look.
BUFFY: Well, wait… She was wiggy about  the seal from minute one.
GILES: Yes, I guess she was.
BUFFY: (thinking) Her trunks.
GILES: What about them?
GILES: These are definitely boys clothes. Why would a girl pack these?
BUFFY: How about this one? What kind of girl travels with a mummified corpse…
XANDER: Do you want to, uh… would you like to, you know…
AMPATA: I would love to dance.
OZ: Who is that?
DEVON: She's an exchange student. From South America.
OZ: No. The Eskimo.
GILES: Unless she gets a continual supply of victims, Ampata will return forever to her frozen mummy state.
BUFFY: She did say she wanted to meet lots  of people.
GILES: And she's going to need to meet another one soon.
BUFFY: So much for her normal life of fun  and dating and- (it hits her) --Xander.
XANDER: Okay. At least I can rule out,  'Something I said.'
BUFFY: I should've guessed. Remember? Ampata wanted us to hide the seal.
GILES: And then she wanted us to destroy it, because--- (realizing) Wait.
BUFFY: Waiting.
GILES: We already know that the seal was  used to contain the mummy.
BUFFY: What? You mean that, if breaking  the seal freed her-
GILES: --reassembling it will trap her.
BUFFY: I'll stop Ampata. Before she gives Xander the kiss of death.
GILES: Be careful.
BUFFY: I will. Besides, I've got the element of surprise. Ampata still doesn't  know my secret identity.
XANDER: You seen Ampata?
WILLOW: I shrugged.
XANDER: Next time you should probably  say, 'shrug.'
WILLOW: Sigh.
SVEN: I thought this exchange student thing would be a great deal. But look what  I got stuck with. 'Momento'? 'Punchy fruity drinky?' Is Cordelia even from  this country?
JONATHAN: Your hands feel kind of… rough.
AMPATA: Do I look like I am with Xander?
JONATHAN: Whoa! That's my cue to leave.
XANDER: There you are. (going to her) Why did you run away?
AMPATA: Because I… I do not deserve you.
XANDER: Ha! Wh-You think you don't… (pointing back and forth) …that I would think… (then, laughing) Man, I love you!
AMPATA: I am very happy. And very sad.
XANDER: Then talk to me. Tell me what's wrong.
AMPATA: I can't!
XANDER: I know why you can't tell me. It's  a secret, right?
GILES: 'Inca cosmology unites the bird-head with its paler twin.' (studying the seal) Ah, yes… the paler twin.
AMAPTA: Xander, I am sorry.
XANDER: (dazed) Ampata…
BUFFY: Where's Xander?
WILLOW: He was looking for Ampata.
BUFFY: We've to find them. Ampata is the mummy.
WILLOW: Oh. (smiles) Good. (stops smiling) Xander!
BUFFY: Where'd they go?
WILLOW: Backstage, I think.
OZ: Who is that girl?
BUFFY: Are you all right?
XANDER: I think so. (touching his jaw) That was some kiss.
BUFFY: Where's Ampata?
XANDER: She said something about the seal.
BUFFY: The seal. At the museum. Where  Giles is. She's gone to stop him. Come on!
XANDER: What's going on?
WILLOW: He doesn't know.
BUFFY: We'll tell him on the way.
GILES: 'The Condor soars… But the prey  is in his talons.' That's it!
XANDER: No. Giles must've… researched wrong.
WILLOW: (softly) Xander, he didn't.
XANDER: But I know Ampata. This can't be. She told me… she said…
BUFFY: I know.
GILES: 'The spondylus shell evokes Mamacocha,  mother of all the water.'
BUFFY: --You don't kiss and tell.
AMPATA: Looks like you've been keeping  some secrets from me.
BUFFY: Oh, and you are?
AMPATA: I shared your life-
AMPATA: --Now you'll share my death.
AMPATA: This won't hurt.
XANDER: If you're going to kiss anybody, it  should be me.
AMPATA: Xander, we can be together. Just  let me have this one.
XANDER: That's never gonna happen.
AMPATA: I must do this, now, or it is the end. For me and for us.
XANDER: No!
AMPATA: Yes.
XANDER: I'm really the fun talking guy today, huh? Sorry.
BUFFY: We don't have to talk.
XANDER: I just… Present company excluded,  I have the worst taste in women. Of  anyone. In the world. Ever.
BUFFY: Ampata wasn't evil. At least not to  start with. And I do think she cared for you.
XANDER: Yeah, but I think the whole sucking- the-life-out-of-people thing would  have been a strain on the relationship.
BUFFY: She was gypped. She was just a girl and she had her life taken from her. I remember when I heard the prophesy  that I was going to die. I wasn't exactly  obsessed with doing the right thing.
XANDER: But you did. You gave up your life.
BUFFY: I had you to bring me back.
