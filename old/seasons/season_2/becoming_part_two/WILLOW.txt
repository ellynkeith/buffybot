Oz?
Oz. . . . ?
Hi. . .  (Sees Xander) Hi Xander. . . 
(very weakly) My head feels big. Is it big?
Is everybody else okay?
I'm okay, Buffy, really. I mean, I don't feel good, but I'm awake and I know my name and who's president and how many fingers so they don't think my brain got  mushed at all.
I know. I'm sorry I didn't get to cure Angel.
I guess. . . Any luck finding Giles?
What?
I want to try again.
The curse. We never got to finish it. Maybe we <b>can</b> restore Angel's soul.
I'm okay.
There's no use arguing with me. Do you see my resolve face? You've seen it before and you know what it means. (to Cordy) Just help me cast the spell and you can give me a complete makeover.
We can help Buffy -- if we turn Angel back soon enough, we can stop him from ever awakening Acathla.
Go with Cordy to the library and get my things. She'll fill you in.
Xander, you go to Buffy. Tell her what we're doing. Maybe she can stall.
Resolve face.
Are we ready?
You don't have to understand it. You just have to say it. I hope.
Not dead, nor not of the living. . .
Gods, bind him, cast his heart from the demon. . . realm. . . return his. . .
I call on. . . I. . .
Te implor Doamne, nu ignora accasta rugaminte! Lasa orbita  sa fie vasul care-I va transporta sufletul la el! (I call on you, Gods, do not ignore this supplication! Let the  orb be the vessel to carry his soul to him!)
Este scris, aceasta putere este dreptul poporuil meu  de a conduce. . .  (It is written, this power is my people's right to wield. . . )
Asa sa fie! Acum! (Let it be so! Now!)
Look who's talking. . .
No.
I think the spell worked. I felt something go through me, it was powerful. Kind of scary.
Or maybe Angel was saved and they just want to be alone together.
Yeah. She'll be here in a while.
