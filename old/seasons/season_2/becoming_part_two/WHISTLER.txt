I don't think he's here.
Whistler.
Waiting for you.
'Cause I need a date for the prom.  My mother says I may attend,  but no fondling.
Hel<b>lo</b> to the imagery. Very nice.
You know, it wasn't supposed to go down like this. Nobody saw  you coming. I figured this for Angel's big day, but I thought he was here to <b>stop</b> Acathla, not bring him forth. But you two made  with the smootchies and now he's a creep again.
Hey, not here to judge. Body like yours - I'd pretty much give up my soul for a shot at that, too. But it took Angel off the roster. Which puts you on the spots in a big way. What are you gonna do?  What are you prepared to do?
Or maybe I should ask, what are you prepared to give up?
Wow. Good guess.
(serious) In the end, you're always by yourself. You're all you got -- That's the point.
The sword isn't enough. You gotta be ready. (she's gone) You gotta know how to use it!
Man, this is gonna be close. . . 
You know, raiding an Englishman's fridge is like dating a nun. You're never gonna get the good stuff.
Angel's the key. His blood will open the door to Hell. Acathla opens his big mouth, creates the vortex, then only Angel's blood'll close it. One blow. Send 'em both  back to hell. But I strongly suggest you get there before that happens. The faster you kill Angel, the easier it'll be for you.
It's all on the line here, kid.
Wrong, kid. You got one more thing.
