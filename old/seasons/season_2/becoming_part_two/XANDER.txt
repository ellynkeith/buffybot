Yeah, I heard them chase you out. I was just coming out of it.
Souvenir.
The doctor said it was. . . head trauma. . . she could wake up any time, but the longer it takes. . . the less likely it is.
With relatives, in Phoenix. I called them. They're getting a plane back.
Man, I didn't even think. I'll call him.
Hey!
Did Giles keep up with you?
No.
I don't want to leave, she might --
Thanks --
Come on, Will. . .  (He takes a moment, continues) Look, you don't have a choice here. You gotta wake up. I need you, Will. How am I gonna pass trig? Who am I  gonna call every night to talk about what we did all day? You're my best friend, you've always. . . 
I love you.
Willow?
She's just waking up. . . 
Hi. (to Oz) I'm gonna get a doctor.
On Crawford street. Sure. That makes sense. What's the drill?
You'll need backup.
Do you --
-- do you think Giles is still alive?
I don't see how.
I don't like it. You're talking about messing with  powerful magic, and you're weak.
You don't look okay. Does she?
Try to stay on topic here, honey.
Be careful.
Calvary's here. Cavalry's a frightened guy with a rock,  but it's here.
This is better.
That's a new look for you.
Willow. . . she said to tell you. . .
. . . kick his ass.
Giles. Giles!
Can you walk?
I am too real! Let's go!
Then why would they make you see <b>me</b>?
You guys didn't see her either.
Maybe it wasn't in time. If he did pull the sword out, and she had to  kill him, maybe he was already dead when it happened.
