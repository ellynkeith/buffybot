There's been some terrible mistake.
No, I --
No. She goes out; I can't always keep track, but. . .  (remembering) She said she was going to her friend Willow's house. Maybe she slept over.
Yes. . . 
What. . . ?
Well. . . she's had some fights, but. . . 
Buffy!
Buffy where have you been? Are you okay? The police were here.  Are you okay? I went looking for you.
Who is this man? (to Spike) Who are you? (to Buffy) Are you okay?
Doing what? Buffy, terrible things have happened. What were you doing?
Know what?
And what do you do?
Well, I'm not sure how I feel about this. . . 
Buffy. . . what's going on?
Um, have we met?
Oh. So. . . do you live here in town?
Is Willow all right?
Angel? Your boyfriend?
(to Buffy) So you didn't kill that girl?
Did she explode like those men outside?
Like what you are?
Honey, are you sure you're a slayer?
I mean, have you tried <b>not</b> being a slayer?
It's 'cause you didn't have a strong father figure, isn't it? Isn't it?
We should call the police.
Well, now that we know that you're innocent. . .
I didn't think that. . . I just, now we have proof.
I'm sure they'll understand --
You wouldn't hurt them, honey.
Do what?
Sword? Buffy, what's happening?
Don't you talk to me like that!
You can't just drop something like this on me and pretend it's nothing!
No! I'm tired of "I don't have time" and "You wouldn't understand." I am your mother and you are going to make  time to explain yourself.
Well, I don't accept that!
Well, it stops now.
No. This is insane. You need help.
I'm not letting you out of this house.
You walk out of this house, don't even think about coming back.
Buffy?
