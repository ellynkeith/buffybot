COP: Back away from the girl! Put your hands up and  back away slowly!
BUFFY: But, I didn't --
COP: Do it now!
COP: This one's dead.
COP: What about up there?
BUFFY: Xander!
COP: Get her out of here!
BUFFY: (re: Xander) See if he's okay!
COP: You'd do well to keep your mouth shut, missy.
BUFFY: I didn't do anything!
SNYDER: Why do I find that so very hard to believe?
COP: (to the other cops) In there. (as they go inside,) You know this girl?
SNYDER: Buffy Summers. If there's trouble, she's behind it.
BUFFY: You stupid little troll, you have no idea --
SNYDER: Attitude problem. Serious.
BUFFY: Please, see if the others are okay. . . 
COP: That's enough.
COP: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say --
SNYDER: I'm just a civil servant. . . 
COP: All units, we have a fugitive on foot at the high school, homicide  suspect, female, blonde, approximately sixteen years old, suspect is very dangerous --
BUFFY: Xander!
BUFFY: I didn't know if you were okay. The cops -
XANDER: Yeah, I heard them chase you out. I was just coming out of it.
XANDER: Souvenir.
BUFFY: Well, what about the others? Are they --
BUFFY: Okay, that was about equal parts protecting me and copping a feel, right?
BUFFY: What is it?
XANDER: The doctor said it was. . . head trauma. . . she could wake up any time, but the longer it takes. . . the less likely it is.
BUFFY: I shouldn't have let her try to do the curse.  Angel must have known.
BUFFY: Where are her folks?
XANDER: With relatives, in Phoenix. I called them. They're getting a plane back.
BUFFY: Does Oz know?
XANDER: Man, I didn't even think. I'll call him.
XANDER: Hey!
BUFFY: You're not hurt?
CORDELIA: I ran. I think I made it through three counties before I realized noone was chasing me. Not real brave.
BUFFY: It was the right thing to do.
XANDER: Did Giles keep up with you?
CORDELIA: I didn't see Giles.
BUFFY: (to Xander) You mean he's not here?
XANDER: No.
ANGEL: Hi, Rupert. 
ANGEL: I wasn't sure you were gonna wake up. You had me worried.
GILES: What do you want?
ANGEL: I want to torture you. I used to love it, and it's been a long time. I mean, the last time I tortured someone they didn't even <b>have</b> chainsaws.
ANGEL: (turns to look) Oh, yeah, Acathla. He's an even harder guy to wake up than you are. I performed the ritual, said all the right phrases, blood on my hand. . . Got nothing. Big donut hole for my  troubles. I figure you know the ritual; you're pretty up on these things, you could probably tell me what I'm doing wrong.  But honestly, I sort of hope you don't. . .  (turning back to Giles) . . . 'cause I <b>really</b> wanna torture you.
ANGEL: Okay. Where do we start? Ooh. Fingers.
JOYCE: There's been some terrible mistake.
STEIN: And you have no idea where your daughter is?
JOYCE: No, I --
STEIN: Do you always let your daughter stay out this late?
JOYCE: No. She goes out; I can't always keep track, but. . .  (remembering) She said she was going to her friend Willow's house. Maybe she slept over.
STEIN: Is that Willow Rosenberg?
JOYCE: Yes. . . 
STEIN: (to the other) Second victim.
JOYCE: What. . . ?
STEIN: Does your daughter have a history of violence, Ms Summers?
JOYCE: Well. . . she's had some fights, but. . . 
STEIN: You call us, okay? If she decides to stop by. It'd be best if she just comes in.
WHISTLER: I don't think he's here.
BUFFY: Who are you?
WHISTLER: Whistler.
BUFFY: What are you doing here?
WHISTLER: Waiting for you.
BUFFY: Why?
WHISTLER: 'Cause I need a date for the prom.  My mother says I may attend,  but no fondling.
BUFFY: (incredibly calm) I have lost friends tonight, and I may lose more. If you have information worth hearing then I am grateful for it. If you want to make jokes then I will pull out your ribcage and wear it as a hat.
WHISTLER: Hel<b>lo</b> to the imagery. Very nice.
WHISTLER: You know, it wasn't supposed to go down like this. Nobody saw  you coming. I figured this for Angel's big day, but I thought he was here to <b>stop</b> Acathla, not bring him forth. But you two made  with the smootchies and now he's a creep again.
BUFFY: We didn't know. . . 
WHISTLER: Hey, not here to judge. Body like yours - I'd pretty much give up my soul for a shot at that, too. But it took Angel off the roster. Which puts you on the spots in a big way. What are you gonna do?  What are you prepared to do?
BUFFY: Whatever I have to.
WHISTLER: Or maybe I should ask, what are you prepared to give up?
BUFFY: You don't have anything useful to tell me, do you? What are you,  some immortal demon sent down to even the score between good  and evil?
WHISTLER: Wow. Good guess.
BUFFY: Why don't you try getting off your immortal ass and <b>fighting</b> evil  once in a while? 'Cause I'm tired of doing this by myself. 
WHISTLER: (serious) In the end, you're always by yourself. You're all you got -- That's the point.
BUFFY: Spare me.
WHISTLER: The sword isn't enough. You gotta be ready. (she's gone) You gotta know how to use it!
WHISTLER: Man, this is gonna be close. . . 
COP: Hold it! Right there. Hands above your head. Do it!
SPIKE: Hello, love.
SPIKE: <b>Will you hold on for a second?</b>
SPIKE: Hey! White flag here! I quit!
BUFFY: Let me clear this up for you. We're mortal enemies.  We don't get "time-outs."
BUFFY: What are you talking about?
SPIKE: I'm talking about your ex, love. I'm talking about putting him in  the bloody ground.
BUFFY: This has got to be the lamest trick you guys have ever thought up.
SPIKE: He's got your watcher. Right now he's probably torturing him.
BUFFY: What do you want?
SPIKE: I told you. I wanna stop Angel. (smiles) I wanna save the world.
BUFFY: Okay. You do remember that you're a vampire, right?
SPIKE: We like to talk big, vampires do. "I'm gonna destroy the world," -- just tough guy talk, strutting around with your friends over a pint of blood.
SPIKE: Truth is, I like this world. You got dog racing, Manchester United, "Love Boat," and you got people. Billions of people walking around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. But then someone comes along with a vision. With a real passion for destruction. Angel could pull it off. Goodbye Piccadilly, farewell Leicester bloody Square, you see what I'm saying?
BUFFY: Uh, sort of?
SPIKE: Why don't you put that stake down?
BUFFY: 'Cause of the whole 'not believing you' issue. You might not be down with Angel but why would you ever come to me?
SPIKE: I want Dru back. I want it like it was, before he came back. (disgusted) The way she acts around him. . . 
BUFFY: Oh, you're pathetic!
BUFFY: I've got friends in the hospital - people have died --
SPIKE: I wasn't in on that raiding party --
BUFFY: (not stopping) -- and I may lose more of them, the whole world could be sucked  into Hell and you need my help 'cause your girlfriend's a big ho?  Let me take this opportunity to <b>not care</b>.
SPIKE: I can't fight them both alone and neither can you!
BUFFY: You're a killer.
SPIKE: And I'm all you got.
BUFFY: All right. Talk.
SPIKE: Let me just kill this guy --
SPIKE: Oh. Right.
BUFFY: Come on. Let's get inside.
CORDELIA: She's gonna be okay.
CORDELIA: Do you want some coffee?
XANDER: I don't want to leave, she might --
CORDELIA: I'll get it.
XANDER: Thanks --
XANDER: Come on, Will. . .  (He takes a moment, continues) Look, you don't have a choice here. You gotta wake up. I need you, Will. How am I gonna pass trig? Who am I  gonna call every night to talk about what we did all day? You're my best friend, you've always. . . 
XANDER: I love you.
XANDER: Willow?
WILLOW: Oz?
WILLOW: Oz. . . . ?
XANDER: She's just waking up. . . 
OZ: (to Willow) Hey, baby. . . 
WILLOW: Hi. . .  (Sees Xander) Hi Xander. . . 
XANDER: Hi. (to Oz) I'm gonna get a doctor.
OZ: (to Willow) How do you feel?
WILLOW: (very weakly) My head feels big. Is it big?
OZ: No, it's head-sized.
WILLOW: Is everybody else okay?
ANGEL: Rupert, buddy, I'm here to tell you I'm impressed. How're you holding up?
GILES: Never. . . better. . . 
ANGEL: Glad to hear it.
ANGEL: Now. Tell me when it hurts.
JOYCE: Buffy!
BUFFY: Mom. . . 
JOYCE: Buffy where have you been? Are you okay? The police were here.  Are you okay? I went looking for you.
BUFFY: Mom, let's go inside --
JOYCE: Who is this man? (to Spike) Who are you? (to Buffy) Are you okay?
BUFFY: MOM.
BUFFY: I'm okay. I was. . . busy. . . doing something. And this is  Spike, and he was doing it too.
JOYCE: Doing what? Buffy, terrible things have happened. What were you doing?
SPIKE: What, your mum doesn't know?
JOYCE: Know what?
BUFFY: That, uh, that, uh, I'm in a rock band.
BUFFY: Yes, a rock band, with Spike here. . . .
SPIKE: (helping) Right, she plays the. . . triangle --
BUFFY: -- drums --
SPIKE: Drums, yeah, she's hell on the old skins, you know.
JOYCE: And what do you do?
SPIKE: Well, I sing.
BUFFY: Why don't we go inside now and talk about it.
JOYCE: Well, I'm not sure how I feel about this. . . 
BUFFY: (to Spike) You think she's buying it?
SPIKE: One of Angel's boys.
BUFFY: Must have been watching me. Or you.
SPIKE: He won't get the chance to tattle on us now.
JOYCE: Buffy. . . what's going on?
BUFFY: Mom. . . I'm a vampire slayer.
WILLOW: I'm okay, Buffy, really. I mean, I don't feel good, but I'm awake and I know my name and who's president and how many fingers so they don't think my brain got  mushed at all.
BUFFY: Thank God. . . I'm sorry I can't be there.
WILLOW: I know. I'm sorry I didn't get to cure Angel.
BUFFY: Don't be. I just think it wasn't meant to happen. I know I'm  never gonna get Angel back the way he was and, you know,  it makes it easier.
WILLOW: I guess. . . Any luck finding Giles?
BUFFY: Yes. I got a lucky break.
WILLOW: What?
BUFFY: You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
BUFFY: Xander! Angel and the others are holed up outside town.  You know that funky looking mansion you showed me one time?
XANDER: On Crawford street. Sure. That makes sense. What's the drill?
BUFFY: I'm gonna hit the place come daybreak. I just need to get something first.
XANDER: You'll need backup.
BUFFY: No. You stay there. I'm covered.
XANDER: Do you --
XANDER: -- do you think Giles is still alive?
BUFFY: I think so. I just wish he was here to tell me what to do.
JOYCE: Um, have we met?
SPIKE: You hit me with an axe one time. (imitating her) "Get the Hell away from my daughter!". . .
JOYCE: Oh. So. . . do you live here in town?
JOYCE: Is Willow all right?
BUFFY: She's fine. (to Spike) Talk to me. What's the deal?
SPIKE: Simple. I help you kill Angel, you let me and Dru skip town.
JOYCE: Angel? Your boyfriend?
BUFFY: Forget about Drusilla. She doesn't walk.
SPIKE: There's no deal without Dru!
BUFFY: She killed Kendra.
SPIKE: (genuinely proud) Dru bagged a slayer? She didn't tell me! Good for her! (off Buffy's look) Well, not from your perspective, I suppose. . .
BUFFY: I can't believe I invited you in my house.
JOYCE: (to Buffy) So you didn't kill that girl?
BUFFY: Of course not!
JOYCE: Did she explode like those men outside?
BUFFY: She was a slayer, Mom.
JOYCE: Like what you are?
SPIKE: (to Buffy) Look, this deal works one way only. Full stop. Me and Dru for Angel.
JOYCE: Honey, are you sure you're a slayer?
SPIKE: I'll take her out of the country. You'll never hear from us again,  I bloody well hope.
BUFFY: All right. Get back to the mansion. Make sure Giles is all right.
JOYCE: I mean, have you tried <b>not</b> being a slayer?
BUFFY: Mom. . .  (to Spike) Be ready to back me up when I make my move.
SPIKE: Right.
BUFFY: If Giles dies, <b>she</b> dies.
JOYCE: It's 'cause you didn't have a strong father figure, isn't it? Isn't it?
BUFFY: It's just fate, Mom. I'm the Slayer. Accept it.
JOYCE: We should call the police.
BUFFY: We're not calling the police.
JOYCE: Well, now that we know that you're innocent. . .
BUFFY: What, did you think I was guilty? Feeling the love in <b>this</b> room, jeez.
JOYCE: I didn't think that. . . I just, now we have proof.
BUFFY: We have my word, Mom. Not proof.
JOYCE: I'm sure they'll understand --
BUFFY: You get them involved, you'll get them killed.
JOYCE: You wouldn't hurt them, honey.
BUFFY: Mom, I'm a slayer, not a postal worker. The cops just can't handle demons. I have to do it.
JOYCE: Do what?
BUFFY: I'm gonna need Kendra's sword.
JOYCE: Sword? Buffy, what's happening?
BUFFY: (impatiently) Just have another drink, okay?
JOYCE: Don't you talk to me like that!
JOYCE: You can't just drop something like this on me and pretend it's nothing!
BUFFY: I'm sorry, I don't have time --
JOYCE: No! I'm tired of "I don't have time" and "You wouldn't understand." I am your mother and you are going to make  time to explain yourself.
BUFFY: I told you. I'm a vampire slayer.
JOYCE: Well, I don't accept that!
BUFFY: Open your eyes, Mom! What do you think has been going on for the last two years? The fights, the weird occurrences -  how many times have you washed blood out of my clothes, you still haven't figured it out?
JOYCE: Well, it stops now.
BUFFY: It doesn't stop! Do you think I chose to be like this? Do you know how lonely it is? How dangerous? I would love to be upstairs watching TV or gossiping about boys or god, even studying. But I have to save the world. Again.
JOYCE: No. This is insane. You need help.
BUFFY: I'm not crazy, Mom! What I need is for you to chill. I'll be back.
JOYCE: I'm not letting you out of this house.
BUFFY: You can't stop me.
JOYCE: You walk out of this house, don't even think about coming back.
CORDELIA: So Buffy's going for the big showdown, huh? I wish we could help. You know, without dying. . .
XANDER: I don't see how.
WILLOW: I want to try again.
OZ: Try what?
WILLOW: The curse. We never got to finish it. Maybe we <b>can</b> restore Angel's soul.
XANDER: I don't like it. You're talking about messing with  powerful magic, and you're weak.
WILLOW: I'm okay.
XANDER: You don't look okay. Does she?
CORDELIA: Listen to him. The hair is <b>so</b> flat, and, do you even <b>use</b> base?
XANDER: Try to stay on topic here, honey.
CORDELIA: What?
WILLOW: There's no use arguing with me. Do you see my resolve face? You've seen it before and you know what it means. (to Cordy) Just help me cast the spell and you can give me a complete makeover.
CORDELIA: You're not just saying that?
WILLOW: We can help Buffy -- if we turn Angel back soon enough, we can stop him from ever awakening Acathla.
OZ: I pretty much missed out on some stuff, didn't I? 'Cause this is all making the kind of sense that's not.
WILLOW: Go with Cordy to the library and get my things. She'll fill you in.
OZ: Sure. I'll drive.
WILLOW: Xander, you go to Buffy. Tell her what we're doing. Maybe she can stall.
WILLOW: Resolve face.
XANDER: Be careful.
ANGEL: You know I can stop the pain. You've been very brave, but it's over. You've given enough now let me make it stop.
GILES: Please. . .
ANGEL: Tell me what I need to know.
GILES: To be worthy. . . you must perform the ritual. . . in a tutu.
GILES: Pillock.
ANGEL: All right, that's it. Someone get the chain saw.
SPIKE: Now now. . .
SPIKE: Don't let's lose our temper.
ANGEL: Keep out of it, Sit 'n' Spin.
SPIKE: You cut him up, you'll never get your answers.
ANGEL: (suspiciously) Exactly when did you become so level-headed?
SPIKE: Right about the time you became so pig-headed. You have your way with him, you'll never get to destroy the world. And I don't fancy spending the next month trying to get librarian out of the carpet. There are other ways.
ANGEL: Enlighten me.
SPIKE: Do you want to play a game?
SNYDER: You do know this is a crime scene, don't you?
SNYDER: But then, you're a criminal, so that pretty much works out.
BUFFY: You know I didn't do it. The police will figure it out.
SNYDER: In case you didn't notice, the police in Sunnydale are deeply  stupid. It doesn't matter anyway. Whatever they find, you've proved too much of a liability for this school.
SNYDER: These are the moments you want to savor. You wish time  would stop so you can live them over and over again.  You're expelled.
BUFFY: You never ever got a single date when you were in  high school, did you?
SNYDER: (it's true) Your point being. . .
SNYDER: It's Snyder. Tell the Mayor I have good news.
DRUSILLA: Is that better? My poor boy. . .
DRUSILLA: Let's see what's inside.
DRUSILLA: Of course. . .
DRUSILLA: Look at me. . . be in me. . .
DRUSILLA: See with your heart.
GILES: Jenny. . .
JENNY: Rupert.
GILES: Oh, God, Jenny, I thought I'd lost you. . .
JENNY: Shhh. . . I'll never leave you.
GILES: We have to get out of here. . .
JENNY: Slowly. You're weak. . .
GILES: It can't be you. . .
JENNY: Did you tell Angel? About the ritual?
GILES: No. . . but we have to get him away from Acathla.
JENNY: Why? Is he close to figuring it out?
GILES: Later. . .
JENNY: Rest. Tell me what to do. . .
JENNY: It's all right. . . We'll be together. . . finally. . .  we'll have everything we never got to have. . .  Never got to feel. . . just tell me what to do.
GILES: Get Angel away from. . . Acathla. . .
JENNY: Angel himself? He's the key. . .
GILES: His blood. He must not. . .
JENNY: Shhh. . .
ANGEL: The blood. Of course. The Blood on my hands must be my own. I am the key that will open the door. My blood. My life. (suddenly matter of fact) Okay, kill him.
SPIKE: What if he's lying?
ANGEL: Yeah, good point. All right, don't kill him. You know, I like having you watch my back, kind of like old times. . .
SPIKE: Uh, Drusilla. . .
ANGEL: Honey. . .
SPIKE: We are finished here, ducks. . .
DRUSILLA: Sorry. . . I was in the moment.
BUFFY: What did you mean, "the sword isn't enough"?
WHISTLER: You know, raiding an Englishman's fridge is like dating a nun. You're never gonna get the good stuff.
BUFFY: Tell me how to use it.
WHISTLER: Angel's the key. His blood will open the door to Hell. Acathla opens his big mouth, creates the vortex, then only Angel's blood'll close it. One blow. Send 'em both  back to hell. But I strongly suggest you get there before that happens. The faster you kill Angel, the easier it'll be for you.
BUFFY: Don't worry about me.
WHISTLER: It's all on the line here, kid.
BUFFY: I can deal. (looks at the sword, at him)  I got nothing left to lose.
WHISTLER: Wrong, kid. You got one more thing.
BUFFY: Xander!
XANDER: Calvary's here. Cavalry's a frightened guy with a rock,  but it's here.
XANDER: This is better.
BUFFY: You're not here to fight. You get Giles out of there and run like Hell, understood? I can't protect you. I'm gonna be too busy killing.
XANDER: That's a new look for you.
BUFFY: It's a present for Angel. This ends it, Xander. I'm ready.
XANDER: Willow. . . she said to tell you. . .
BUFFY: Tell me what?
XANDER: . . . kick his ass.
BUFFY: I'm gonna do a lot more than that.
ANGEL: (in Latin) Acathla. Mundatus sum. Pro te necavi. Sanguinem meum  pro te effundam, quo me dignum esse demonstrem. (Acathla. I have been cleansed. I have killed for you.  I will bleed for you and prove myself worthy.)
WILLOW: Are we ready?
CORDELIA: Stinky herbs are go.
OZ: Did I mention that I didn't take Latin?
WILLOW: You don't have to understand it. You just have to say it. I hope.
OZ: Right. (Reads slowly, in Latin) Quod perditum est, invenietur. (What was lost, shall be found.)
WILLOW: Not dead, nor not of the living. . .
BUFFY: Hello, lover.
ANGEL: I don't have time for you.
BUFFY: You don't have a lot of time <b>left</b>.
ANGEL: Coming on kind of strong, don't you think? You're  playing some deep odds here - do you really think you  can take us all on?
BUFFY: No, I don't.
SPIKE: Painful, isn't it?
SPIKE: I don't want to hurt you, baby. . .
SPIKE: Doesn't mean I won't. . .
XANDER: Giles. Giles!
GILES: Xander?
XANDER: Can you walk?
GILES: You're not real. . .
XANDER: I am too real! Let's go!
GILES: It's a trick! They get inside my head, make me see what I want.
XANDER: Then why would they make you see <b>me</b>?
GILES: Right. Let's go.
DRUSILLA: Oooh, here it comes. . .
ANGEL: You almost made it, Buf.
BUFFY: It's not over yet.
ANGEL: My boy Acathla's about to wake up. You're going to Hell.
BUFFY: Save me a seat.
WILLOW: Gods, bind him, cast his heart from the demon. . . realm. . . return his. . .
WILLOW: I call on. . . I. . .
OZ: Willow?
CORDELIA: Are you okay?
WILLOW: Te implor Doamne, nu ignora accasta rugaminte! Lasa orbita  sa fie vasul care-I va transporta sufletul la el! (I call on you, Gods, do not ignore this supplication! Let the  orb be the vessel to carry his soul to him!)
OZ: (to Cordy) Is this a good thing?
CORDELIA: (to Willow, not knowing what to say) Hey! Speak English!
WILLOW: Este scris, aceasta putere este dreptul poporuil meu  de a conduce. . .  (It is written, this power is my people's right to wield. . . )
SPIKE: I wish there was another way. . .
SPIKE: God, he's going to kill her. . .
ANGEL: That's everything, huh? No weapons, no friends.  No hope. Take all that away and what's left?
BUFFY: Me.
WILLOW: Asa sa fie! Acum! (Let it be so! Now!)
ANGEL: Oh. . .
ANGEL: Buffy?
ANGEL: Buffy, what's going on? I don't remember. . . where are we?
BUFFY: Angel?
ANGEL: (sees her cuts) You're hurt!
ANGEL: God, I feel like I haven't seen you in months. . .  Buffy, everything's so muddled. . .
ANGEL: Oh, Buffy. . .
ANGEL: What's happening, Buffy?
BUFFY: Shhhhh. . . it doesn't matter.
BUFFY: I love you.
ANGEL: I love you. . .
BUFFY: Close your eyes.
JOYCE: Buffy?
GILES: (to Willow) Are you sure you should be out of bed?
WILLOW: Look who's talking. . .
CORDELIA: Any word?
XANDER: You guys didn't see her either.
WILLOW: No.
OZ: But we know the world didn't end. 'Cause, check it out.
GILES: We went back to the mansion. It's empty, and Acathla is dormant.
WILLOW: I think the spell worked. I felt something go through me, it was powerful. Kind of scary.
CORDELIA: Plus the orb did that cool glow thing.
XANDER: Maybe it wasn't in time. If he did pull the sword out, and she had to  kill him, maybe he was already dead when it happened.
OZ: Then she'd want to be alone, I guess.
WILLOW: Or maybe Angel was saved and they just want to be alone together.
GILES: Perhaps.
CORDELIA: Well, she's bound to show up sooner or later. We still have school.
WILLOW: Yeah. She'll be here in a while.
