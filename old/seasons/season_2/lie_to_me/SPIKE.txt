Darling, I heard a funny thing just now. Lucius told me you went out for a hunt  the other night.
You, uh, run into anyone? Anyone  interesting? (she doesn't answer) Like Angel?
Yeah. What might you guys have to  talk about then? Old times? Childhood  pranks? It's a little off, you two so friendly,  him being the enemy and all that.
(losing patience) The bird's dead, Dru. You left it in the  cage and you didn't feed it and now it's  all dead. Just like the last one.
I'm sorry, baby. I'm a bad, rude man, I  just don't like you going out. You are  weak. Would you like a new bird?  One that's not dead?
Do I have anyone on watch here? It's  called security, people. Are you all asleep?
Or did we finally find a restaurant  that delivers.
Yeah, I know who I am, too. So what?
You've got a real death wish. It's  almost interesting.
This is great. This will be very useful. (not looking up) So, how'd you find me?
Well, I don't much go for tradition.
Well?
What? Oh. (rolls his eyes, then very flatly) You've got thirty seconds to convince  me not to kill you.
I've known you for two minutes and I  can't stand you. I don't really feature  you living forever. (to Dru) Can I eat him now, love?
So. Who's hungry?
When we get there, everybody spread out.  Two men on the door. First priority is the  Slayer, everything else is fair game but  let's remember to share, people.
Sure you're up for this?
And a special one you'll have. Lucius!
Bring the car 'round.
(to his men)  Take them all. Save the Slayer for me!
Everybody STOP!
It's gonna be all right, baby. (To his men) Let them go.
We're stuck in the basement.
She's not stuck in the basement.
Yes, I suppose you did.
