Do you want me to walk you home?
My mummy used to sing me to sleep  at night. "Run and catch, run and catch,  the lamp is caught in the blackberry patch".  She had the sweetest voice, like cherries.  What will your mummy sing when they  find your body?
Oh, I'm not a person, so that's just--
My Angel.
(comes slowly to him) Do you remember the song mummy  used to sing me? Pretty. She would  sing me to sleep, and the fairies and  sprites would bit at my heels.
Yes…you do…
Or you'll hurt me?
My dear boy's gone all away,  hasn't he? To her.
The girl.
The Slayer. Your heart stinks of her.  Poor little thing. She has no idea  what's in store.
Oh, no, my pet…
You sing the sweetest little song.  Won't you sing for me? Don't you love  me anymore?
(focussed on the bird) My tummy was growly. And you were out. (to the bird) Come on. I will put if you don't sing…
Angel.
(to the bird) I'll give you a seed if you sing…
Wait, sweetie.
Spike…
