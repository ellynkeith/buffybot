Angel and a girl.
Nice to meet you.
So you guys were sweeties in fifth grade?
It's fun to meet someone who knew  Buffy from before she was the -- (off Buffy's glare) -- the here-being girl.
(gets it) Oh! That's what that song's about?
Buffy, Ford was just telling us about  the ninth grade beauty contest. And the,  uh, swimsuit competition?
That's Angel.
Hey, Angel.
Angel, do you want to sit?
Well, Angel, you can still hang  out with us --
Just like that? He told you?
Wow. It's neat. Is it neat?
Oh! Angel.
What are you doing here?
Well, oh.
Well?
Oh! Okay. Uh, I invite you. To come in.
No, I just… I'm not supposed to have  boys in my room.
Okay, good.
Help? You mean like on homework?  No, 'cause you're old and you already  know stuff.
Oh! Great. I'm so the net girl.
What's the name?
Um, Angel, if I say something you  don't really wanna hear, do you  promise not to bite me?
Well, you do sometimes get that way.
Okay, well, you've got a smart gut I  guess. But if there isn't anything weird -  hey, that's weird.
I just checked the school records. He's  not in them. Usually they transfer your  grades and stuff, but… he's not even  registered.
Okay, there's no Fordham listed in  Sunnydale. Curiouser and Curiouser.  Let me see if I can --
Ack! Go!
(calls out:) I'm just going to bed now, Mom.  I'm very sleepy. (to Angel) Come by at sunset tomorrow. I'll  keep looking.
You want me to lie to her? It's Buffy.  Besides, I don't lie good. I lie bad.
Okay. It's probably nothing.
Nothing.
I'm going to work in the computer lab.  On school work that I have. So I could  not hang just now. Hi Ford.
(scared) What?
Ha ha ha ha! (to Ford) It makes me jumpy. (to both) I have to go. Away.
The only thing I could track down  were some E-mails to a guy called Diego.  And this address. The sunset Club.  I still didn't find anything incriminating.
Boy, we blend right in.
Okay, but do they really stick out?
Sore thumbs. Do they stick out? I mean,  have you ever seen a thumb and gone  "wow, that baby is sore".
Like, as in, "Vampires Yay"?
Oh, no. we come here all the time.
The Lonely Ones?
Nobody's gonna talk to us now.
Is that so bad? I mean the dark can get  pretty dark, sometimes you need a story.
Something's up with him. (to Angel) You were right about that.
Why are you so interested in Ford?
Hey Buffy. Did, uh, Angel -
I'm sorry we kept stuff from you.
When Angel came to my room he was  just really concerned for you. And we  didn't want to say anything in case  we were wrong.
(nods) Ours is a forbidden love.
Are there vampires --
