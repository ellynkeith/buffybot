Hey guys.
Did a couple of quick sweeps, you  know, downtown.
You'll figure it out.
I'm okay.
That's be nice.
Do they know about "fun" in England?
I don't know. He might have other plans.
I don't know. I don't think so -- I mean,  they seemed pretty friendly.
No one.
I'm glad someone has a happy.
I don't know.
Ford?
What are you doing here?
Huh?
That's great!
Remember you? Duh, we were in school  together for seven years. You were my  giant fifth grade crush. Remember.
Oh! I'm sorry. This is Ford. Uh, Billy  Fordham. This is Xander and Willow.
Ford and I went to Hemery together, in L.A. (to Ford) And you're here? For real?
This is great! I mean, It's hard, sudden  move, all your friends, delicate time  very emotional but let's talk about me  this is great!
Not even. Ford wouldn't give me  the time of day.
It was terrible. I moped over you for  months. Sitting in my room listening  to that Divinyls song, "I touch myself". (suddenly sheepish) Of course, I had no idea what it was about.
Hey! Are you busy tonight?
We're going to the Bronze. It's the  local club and you gotta come.
You're coming. I have spoken.
I'll walk you. See you guys in French.
Hey, you got here.
Oh, God. Ford! Stop that! The more  people you tell about it, the more  people I have to kill.
I'm gonna grab a soda. Ford, try not to talk.
Oh. Who knew?
I believe that.
So, what'd you do last night?
Nothing at all? You ceased to exist?
Oh.
Not that thirsty.
This is Ford. We went to school  together in L.A.
It's so crowded in here. I'm hot. (to Ford) Do you want to go for a walk?
I'll see you all tomorrow.
No. Well, yeah. Well, maybe. Let's  lay off the tough questions for a while.
Um, Uh, my purse! I left it at the Bronze.  Would you get it for me? Thanks.
Good. Run. Thanks.
There was a cat. A cat here and then  there was, another cat. And they fought,  the cats, and then they left.
What? Whatting a what?
Just like that. Said he found out right  before I got booted from Hemery.
It…yeah, I guess it is . it's nice to have  someone else that I can open up to.  No more hiding.
And then everything was Vampires. I  slacked utterly in school -- and my social  life pretty much dried up and blew away.
Oh, God, the prom. What a disaster.
I think that was the worst night of my life.
It's good to hear. And it's good to be  able to talk to someone who knows.  Who knew me before, and… well. During.
Most everybody else did.
People ignore truths they don't like.
Yeah, isn't that weird?
A truth I like to ignore.
Will! What's up?
You wanna hang? We were cafeteria bound.
Okay, Will. Fess up.
Were you drinking coffee again?  'Cause we've talked about this.
There aren't two of those in the world.
He knows, Giles.
Ford. He knows I'm the Slayer.
I didn't tell him. He knew.
Go. Experience this thing called fun.  I'll try not to have a crisis.
Feel free to say 'dull'.
Must be the weather.
Stick close to me.
I don't think so.
Where's the other one?
Sorry to beep you guys in the middle  of stuff, but this did seem a bit weird.
You took him to monster trucks?
Okay, can we get back on the vampire  tip? These guys were here with a purpose.
I sent him home.
Well, he did bag a vamp his first time  out. You gotta give him credit for… that…
Who is this?
Not sometime. <u>Now</u>time.
Well, they don't make angry mobs  like they used to cuz this girl's alive.  I saw her with Angel.
(quietly, as the implication sinks in) Yes. He is.
He said he killed it.  (turns to them) That's the vampire Ford said he killed.
Why?
Sure. I thought once you'd been invited  you could always just walk in.
Oh.
Do we?
Well, who is these days?
Willow?
And Xander? Wow, everybody's in.  It's a great big exciting conspiracy.
I'm talking about the people I trust.  Who's Drusilla?
And don't lie to me. I'm tired of it.
For what?
I can take it. I can take the truth.
What?
I love you. I don't know if I trust you.
Maybe I'm the one should decide.
You made her a vampire.
Well, I asked for the truth…
Ford.
I'm glad.
I'm not busy.
I like surprises.
Sure.
At nine.
He told me. Everything.
(almost means it) It's okay.
I will.
It's really not.
I'm sorry Ford, I just couldn't wait till  tonight. I'm rash and impulsive -- it's a flaw.
So I'm constantly learning. I'm still fuzzy  on exactly what yours is. I think it has  to do with being a lying scumbag.
But not everybody is a lying scumbag.  There's a difference.
What do you want, Ford? What's  this all about?
I don't need to understand. I just need  to know.
One of them. You want to become  a vampire.
Vampires are kind of picky about  who they change. (realizes) So you were gonna offer them a trade.
Well, I still feel kind of chatty. You were  gonna give them me. Tonight.
What, lure me into the old building,  leave me there for them?
You had to know I'd figure it out, Ford.
What's supposed to happen tonight?
Ford, if these people are still around  when they get here --
There's gotta be a way out of here.
At least let these people out of here.
Do you have any idea what you've done?
What you have to?
What I can see is that right after the sun  goes down Spike and his friends are  gonna be pigging out at the all-you-can-eat  moron bar!
(gives him the look) I think you should try.
I'm trying to save you! You're playing  in some serious traffic here, do you  understand that? You're gonna DIE.  The only hope you have of surviving  is to get out of this pit right now and  my God could you HAVE a dorkier outfit?
No, I don't.
Us? We have something in common now?
Let me explain this to you. You're what  we call the bad guy.
These people aren't gonna get changed,  are they? You, maybe, in exchange for  me, but the rest of them -- they're just fodder.
I got a newsflash, braintrust. That's not  how it works. You die. And a demon  sets up shop in your old house. It walks  and talks and remembers your life but  it's not you.
Your life is nothing?
Ford, these people don't deserve to die.
I'm sorry. I had no idea… But this is  still very wrong.
You have a choice. You don't have a  good choice: what's behind door number  three is pretty much a dead fish but you  have a choice. You're opting for mass  murder here and nothing you say to  me is gonna make that okay.
I think this is part of your little fantasy  drama. Isn't this just how you imagined it?  You tell me how you've suffered and  I feel sorry for you. Well I do feel  sorry for you and if those vampires  come in here and start feeding I'll kill  you myself.
Ford, please. Help me stop this.
Listen to me. This is not the mothership,  okay? This is ugly death come to play.  If we can barricade the door maybe we  can hold them off and try to find another --
Spike!
Good idea. Now they all walk out or  your girlfriend fits in an ashtray.
(to Spike) Down the stairs. Do it now.
You think I'm joking? You think I'm  feeling jolly right now?
You guys got here just in time… to be late.
They're contained. They'll get out eventually,  though. We should clear out. We can  come back when they're gone.
For the body.
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
It'd be simpler if I could just hate him.  I think he wanted me to. I think it made  it easier for him. Be the bad guy. The  villain of the piece. But really, he  was scared.
You known it's just, like, nothing's simple.  I'm always trying to work it out. Who to  hate, or love … who to trust… it's like  the more I know, the more confused I get.
(little voice) I'd like to stop, then. Okay?
Well, does it ever get easy?
Yeah. Does it get easy?
Lie to me.
