Xander, he was obviously in charge.
He didn't seem like the type to let himself be used.
Thinking?
So we're pretty sure there aren't any more Tarakan assassins coming our way?
And you're loving playing nursemaid.
I'm just saying, if Tenille was in charge, she would have had the little captain hat.
I like my new nine-gig hard drive...
Yeah. But who can afford the upgrades?
You don't like him.
(amused) He's a clean clown! (off their looks) I have my own fun...
He has a point. Separation anxiety, the mother figure being taken away, conflict with the father figure...
Xander...
Ohh, what a day! Thank you.
Oh, that thing. (to Xander) That thing.
Oh they are but she's only interested in... uh... her studies. Book-cracker Buffy, it's kind of her nick name.
Cookies.
Buffy, it just seems like you want him to be corrupt or something.
What's up with them?
Different like happy?
You know I will. What do you want me to look for?
How come you're here?
What happened? Unless you don't want to talk about it...
The papers said he fell.
But, I'm sure it wasn't your fault. He started it!
Don't say that.
We gotta prove that somehow. Xander, you got a pen?
Sure, in a fascist society.
Giles, you shouldn't go out there without the Slayer.
Be careful.
Ted's got no criminal record I can find. Damn! The guy's like, citizen of the year!
Don't sweat it?
Okay...
Apparently, the secret ingredient is not love.
I'm not positive, but I think it's Dematorin. It's like a tranquilizer, keeps you all mellow and compliant. And it shares a few components with ecstasy.
(leafing through documents) I count four marriage certificates.
Not a one.
Whoah. 1957. Ted must have married young. Like preschool young.
What's in there?
And the sad thing is, the real Ted must have been a genius. There were design features in that robot that predate--
(guilty) Not any big ones...
I just wanna learn stuff.
