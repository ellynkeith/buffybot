Ma'am, I'm Detective Stein... I'm sorry but I need to ask you a few things... Your relationship with the deceased?
Can you tell me what happened?
I see. Did he slip, do you know what made him fall?
About what?
Was this the first time you two had had an argument?
That was tonight?
Where?
So you've been hit before?
But Ted never hit you.
--Before tonight. Never hit you before tonight.
I believe you. Things got out of hand. He's a big guy.
We're not bringing anything up against your daughter right now. She says Mr. Buchanan struck her and if that's the case... anyway we're gonna examine it further. Right now I think you should just take her home and the two of you try to get some rest.
