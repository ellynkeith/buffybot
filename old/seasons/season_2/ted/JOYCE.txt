I broke a wine glass. So, you're home early...
Oh, uh, this is my daughter, Buffy. And Buffy, this is... this is Ted.
Well... I've been looking for the right moment to introduce you two. He's a wonderful man.
He sells computer software, he revamped my entire system at the gallery. Freed up a lot of my time.
You weren't supposed to see that. 
I really want you to be okay with this, Buffy.
You are?
That picnic was delicious. You know how rare it is to find a man who cooks?
I told him. He wants to know all about you. He's concerned, that's a good thing. (sees Ted shoot) Nice shot, Ted!
Thanks to you.
We won't count it.
Well, it's just miniature golf.
He has a point...
Oh, you have to try one of these, Buffy, they're really good.
Good morning sunshine.
I've got juice. I've got sticky buns. Don't they smell good?
What kind of attitude is that?
He's gone out of his way to be nice to you and you couldn't find two words to say to him on Saturday. Now I don't expect you to love him right away like I do, but I do expect you to treat him decently.
(beat) I don't know, that kind of slipped out... but I guess... it's not exactly like men beat down the door when you're a...
I would never have anything to do with anyone who didn't care about you. But he does, I don't understand why you can't see that.
What?
He never said any such thing. Ted told me what happened. He caught you cheating, didn't he.
He didn't say anything about it in front of the others, did he.
I think that was pretty decent of him.
Amen.
I think every home should have someone like you. It's fantastic. (to Buffy) Don't you think?
(eat some) Honey...
What? Goodness, no, what gave you that idea?
Buffy!
You can go to your room, young lady, that's what you can do.
Where did you come from?
Buffy! Stop it!
Ted... Ted!
We were... um, seeing each other.
He fell. Down the stairs. He fell.
It's done. I've been meaning to clean out this junk for months.
I don't want to talk about this.
I can't. Not yet. Please, Buffy, just go to your room.
Buffy, I'm sorry, I know you--
Ted? Is it really... but you were...
I don't understand this. You were dead.
Why didn't anyone tell us?
Oh, Ted...
Oh my god, Buffy... Ted, I swear she never meant to hurt you, you have to believe me.
You should sit down...
Ted, I think I should talk to Buffy first, before she sees you. I know she'll want to--
I'm sorry, I'm just... I don't know what to do.
Ted, I think you might want to rest for a while...
I think I could use a drink. To celebrate.
Hitting the road?
Well, then, I'd probably better pack.
Ted, please, let go! Get OFF ME!
You want to rent a movie tonight?
Just nothing with horror in it. Or romance. Or men.
Good call. (beat) I still think he's gonna jump out at me. Especially after what the police found in his house, it's too horrible...
I wish I could be so sure.
