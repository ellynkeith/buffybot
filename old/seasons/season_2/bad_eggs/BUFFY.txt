Come on, Mom, please?
But... don't you understand? This is so important!
But... I looked good in it!
But a thin streetwalker! (beat) That's probably not gonna be the winning argument, is it?
I'm gonna be too young to wear that till I'm too old to wear that.
"Everyday Woman?" Why didn't you go straight to "Muumuus R Us"?
Wow, you guys really don't ever come up with new lines, do you?
(to the vamp) But you promised you'd never cheat on me again, honey...
Pleasure's mine.
Oh, sure... they say they'll call...
Oh, bliss. Mall food.
Mom.
Your--? (realizing) Oh. Oh my God.
Technically.
Well, I'll get it --
Sorry.
Saving the world from vampires.
Vampire issues. Did Mister Whitmore notice that I was tardy?
Oh. Right.
As punishments go, this is fairly abstract.
Okay, I get it even less.
God, I can't do this... I can't take care of stuff! I killed my gigapet. Literally! I sat on it and it broke.
I'll just lay it all off on my partner. Who'd I get?
I'm a single mother?
What does this say about me? That I'm doomed to live my mother's life? How deeply scary is that?
Friendly little demons...
Great. Now I have to worry about Butch and Sundance while I'm taking care of junior here.
(to Xander) Please. Like Angel and I are just helpless slaves to passion. Grow up.
We should--
Yeah, this really isn't "hunting" in the classical sense. We should get to work.
You see anything?
Okay. Enough hunting.
Alrighty then egg dude--
Feeding. Check. Burping. Check. Diapers. Check. (adjusts the towel around the egg) Sort of. In theory. (to egg) Okay, kid. Sweet dreams.
Oh, God...
Not that hungry.
Fine.
Did I ask for backseat mommying?
I just feel all funky.
It's not that - I just didn't sleep well.
You're killing me.
Parenting is a pain.
No go.
No Gorches.
Shut. Up.
That would also be cheating.
That news is of the past.
You're awfully gung-ho.
(no intention of stirring) We'll get right on that.
I don't know. Should we be having guilt about not looking for Mr. Whitmore?
Yeah, I'll be fine by tonight. Maybe sweep the cemetery.
No worries.
Yeah, he, uh... does what he can.
As much as I hate to say this - we should go kill bad guys.
What about the Gorches?
Really? You'd do that?
True. And I still have to go home and fill out my egg diary.
I told you. That faux parenting gig I'm doing in school. (then) Like I'm really planning to have kids any time soon. Someday, when I'm done having a life maybe. A kid would be too much to deal with now.
Oh. (then/re-grouping) Well, it's totally okay. I figured there are all kinds of things vampires can't do like, you know, work for the telephone company, volunteer for the red cross. Have little vampires...
No.
No.
I - I can't care. (with difficulty) Angel. when I try to look into the future, all I can see... is you--
And I don't have a choice. Don't you know that? If I could do the logic thing, you think I would even be here? (then) All I can see is you... All I want is you.
Yuck.
Come on, pick up.
Willow. Are you okay?
Your egg. Is it doing anything?
Break it. Right now. Smash it with something heavy.
My egg just went postal on me. It hatched - some kind of crawly monster thing jumped on me-
Yeah, but your egg--
Okay...
Maybe... (pulls it together) Okay. I'm sorry to wake you. Get back to sleep.
Yeah. I'm better. I'm fine.
Nowhere --
It was Willow... I just called 'cause she wasn't feeling well and I was worried.
I... had a bad dream...
Yes. But--
Yes.
Nice bear. Listen, is your --
Okay, soliloquy girl... I just wanted to know about your egg.
You know the egg that Mr. Whitmore gave to you?
And your egg isn't acting... odd or anything?
Sorry about calling you so late last night.
What were you doing up?
No.I think you may be right. My egg may have been some kind of booby trap the vamps laid for me. So far, it seems like everybody else's are normal.
Yeah. I called Giles and he's in research mode. Wants to see it.
Great. I always say - a day without an autopsy is like a day without sunshine...
I see your uhhhhhhhhhhh and raise You a gnyeh.
Where's Giles? I know he'd hate to miss this.
Dissect it? Why me?
I slayed! My work here in done.
Turn it over. Maybe we missed its I.D. bracelet.
Try - best case scenario.
What's a Bezo--
Hey!
Xander?
Are you okay?
What?
(feels her head) Yeah, I'm gonna have a bump...
(rising) Something to do with our hatchlings, I'm sure of that.
I don't know. They sure wanted us out of the way.
Giles?
He picked a hell of a time to get a life.
We can't fight these things unless we know something about them.
A Bozo! Not a bozo.
Yes! Great. Okay, so, we look it up.
A book?
Giles said he was gonna try to find something.
Okay, I'd say he found something.
A pre-prehistoric parasite... the mother hibernates underground, laying eggs. Offspring attach themselves to a host, taking control of their motor functions through neural clamping.
So our people are taking orders from the mama Bezoar. Which begs the question --
Are you all right?
I think I hear mommy calling...
We really don't.
Oh, boy...
We can't let them spread those things.
I'll try.
I'm gonna need a weapon. I'm gonna need a big weapon.
Guys, this is not a great time.
Mom?
Long story!
How?
Is she all right?
Hey, mom, are you doing okay?
I just heard. I was working out. In the gym.
Oh, yeah, well, I was gonna be there but --
True, but the other side of that is --
I'm grounded?
Oh yeah.
You're clear. I'll stay in my room.
Hey, I earned this. Besides, I'm not breaking any rules.
In a minute, mom...
