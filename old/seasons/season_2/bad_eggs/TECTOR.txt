That's the Slayer?
And ain't that Angelus with her?
Well, then, how come she's not slaying and how come he's--
(impressed) So that's Angelus. The Angelus. (then) You gonna take him, or you want me to, Lyle?
Why? You scared?
So why don't you?
I'm tired of rat. I want something good to eat.
Why can't we stay in a nice place? A motel or something, with an ice machine.
How come Angelus is gettin' all snuggly with her? Does the man have no code?
I just don't like it here. I'm cold, and I'm bored and there ain't a decent whore in the whole city limits.
Oh, don't say that...
Are you afraid of her?
(schoolyard taunt) You're afraid of the Slayer...
Think you can?
Is that all you got? Is that all you got...?
She's so cute and little. (turns to Lyle) Can we keep her?
Where is that sorry-ass girl?
What is that....?
