The sex drive in the human animal is intense--
How many of us have lost countless productive hours plagued by unwanted sexual thoughts and feelings -- ?
That was a rhetorical question, Mr. Harris. Not a poll.
Of course, for teenagers such an yourselves these feelings are even more overwhelming. With all sorts of hormones surging through your bodies, compelling you to action - it's often difficult to remember that there are negative consequences to having sex. would anyone care to offer one such consequence?
(interrupting her) I was thinking of something a little more... commonplace, Ms. Chase.
Okay. Anyone--
Now? Another consequence of sexual activity? Anyone?
-- else?
Thank you, Ms. Rosenberg. Among teens unwanted pregnancy would be the number one negative consequence of sexual activity. This is partly because Some teens think of a baby as a toy, or as a companion who will give them love. The truth, of course, is that a child is a relentless, needy tyrant. So, as discussed last week, I've devised an exercise that may give you some idea of what an enormous burden having your own tiny charge can be--
Ladies and gentlemen. I present you with your offspring. Your assignment is as follows. You will split into parenting teams. You and your partner will share equally in the daily task of "raising" your egg.
Every aspect of your child's care will be recorded in this daily log. If your egg breaks - you have killed your child. Naturally, this will affect your grade. Now, please, choose a partner and pick up your children.
