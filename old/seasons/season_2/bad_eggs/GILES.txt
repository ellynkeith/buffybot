Success at last. Your new playmate is a fellow of some repute, it seems.
No, that was before they became vampires. (off their looks) The good news is, they're not among the great thinkers of our time. I doubt they're up to much; They were probably just drawn here by the hellmouth's energy.
You might need some help with those two, they are pretty -- (stops, puzzled) Why do you all have eggs?
Good idea. You really ought to strengthen your numbers when you go up against these two.
Why are you three about? Don't you have class?
Well, then could you give me a hand?
How did the hunt go last night, Buffy?
You didn't go, or you were unsuccessful?
It's true. You and Willow do appear to be awfully sluggish. Are you quite sure you're alright?
Technically, that would be called cheating, yes?
I suppose there is a sort of machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression...
Bit of both would suit.
Presumed by whom?
I think we might wait a few hours before we give up on him completely.
I think you can hold off on that. I'd prefer you save your strength for hunting the Gorches.
Be careful. If you're still feeling sluggish --
Hello.
She's not been in. I was waiting to talk to her about history texts.
I'm sure she didn't mean to --
No, and no I haven't any children. Although sometimes I feel as though I do. Working here.
Feel free.
Sometimes...
Hobby of mine. But not having to do with Buffy in any way.
Buffy told you she'd be here? All afternoon?
I'm sure it's nothing...
What was that?
Yes, it was a gas leak, just get some air and you'll all be fine... (to Xander) What really happened?
