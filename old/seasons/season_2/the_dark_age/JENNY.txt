(smiling) Morning, England.
Willow--
--we're still on for tomorrow?
I'm reviewing some computer basics with a couple of students who have fallen behind. Willow's helping for extra credit.
Nine a.m. okay with you, Xander?
Cordelia is going to meet us.
(to Giles) Walk me to class?
Nice coat.
Oh! Thank you so much for loaning me the Forrester book. It's wonderful.
it was so romantic, so evocative.
You know how you have to dog-ear  your favorite pages so you can go  back to them?
Well, I practically folded back every page. So I underlined the passages I really wanted to discuss.
But then I spilled coffee on it and I couldn't even read it.
(smiles) I'm lying, Rupert. The book's fine. I just love to see you squirm.
Did anyone ever tell you you're kind of a fuddy duddy?
Did anyone ever tell you you're kind of a sexy fuddy duddy?
This weekend --
I think I'd like to stay in.
Saturday night. I'll see if I can make you squirm.
(smiles) Possibly.
Let's see, there's home, school, work, games--
All right, the first thing we want to do is... (sees) ...Buffy.
Is something wrong?
He was home alone drinking?
Not really.
What were the police talking to him about?
We're okay.
(holding her head) Ow...
I think so.
Promise?
I believe you.
Throbbing.
Home. That sounds so good right now.
Thanks for bringing me here. I'm not quite ready to be home alone just yet.
It's strong. (drinks some more) It's helping.
So I got involved. That's what happens  when two people... get involved.
Nothing's safe in this world, Rupert. Don't you know that by now?
What was what?
I didn't. (takes tea) Thanks.
You could take me home... (sets tea down) ...or you could take advantage of me in my weakened state.
Good.
There's never been a better time.
God, you don't change, do you.
"It's not right, wouldn't be proper..."
(demon voice) "... people might get hurt."
(demon-voiced) "You're like a woman, Ripper, you cry at every funeral. You never had the strength for me, you don't deserve me. But guess what, you've got me -- UNDER YOUR SKIN!
Was it good for you?
You never had the stomach. But that's okay, I'm about to rip it out.
(laughs) Three down, two to go! Be seeing you.
It is your time.
Rupert.
Rupert. Hi.
Yeah, I left the phone off the hook. I seem to need a lot of sleep lately.
(shakes her head) I'm fine. I mean, I'm not "running around, wind in my hair, the hills are alive with the Sound of Music" fine, but I'm coping.
I know.
Sure. Some time.
Yeah, some time... I better get to class.
