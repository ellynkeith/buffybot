JOYCE: Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?
BUFFY: What?
BUFFY: Angel!
DRUSILLA: Happy Birthday, Buffy.
BUFFY: Angel?
ANGEL: Hey... Everything okay?
BUFFY: That's what I was going to ask you. You're okay, right?
ANGEL: Sure. I'm fine. What's up?
BUFFY: I had this dream. Drusilla was alive. It was awful-
ANGEL: What happened?
BUFFY: She killed you. Right in front of me. I saw the whole thing.
ANGEL: It was just a dream. It wasn't real.
BUFFY: But it felt so real.
ANGEL: It wasn't. Here I am.
BUFFY: This happened before, Angel. That dream I had about  the Master... It came true.
ANGEL: Still, not every dream you have comes true. I mean, what else did you dream last night? Can you remember?
BUFFY: That... Giles and I opened an office supply warehouse in Las Vegas.
ANGEL: You see my point.
BUFFY: Yeah. But, I mean, what if Drusilla is alive? We never saw her body.
ANGEL: She's not. But even if she was - we'd deal.
BUFFY: But, what if-
ANGEL: What if what?
BUFFY: Sorry. Were we talking?
BUFFY: I... have to get to school.
ANGEL: I know.
BUFFY: God. You feel-
ANGEL: You have to go to school...
BUFFY: Alright. This is me.
ANGEL: You still haven't told me what you want for your birthday.
BUFFY: Surprise me.
ANGEL: Okay. I will...
BUFFY: This was nice. I like you first thing in the morning-
ANGEL: It's bed time for me.
BUFFY: Then I like you at bed time.
BUFFY: I mean... You - know what I mean...  ANGEL I think so. (then) What do you mean?
BUFFY: That I... I like seeing you. And the part at the end of the  night when we say goodbye, it's.., getting harder.
ANGEL: Yeah. It is.
BUFFY: I know. I know.  WILLOW Man. That's - I don't know, that's <u>moxie</u> or something!  BUFFY Totally unplanned. It just came out.
WILLOW: And he was into it? He wants to see you at bed time, too?
BUFFY: Yeah. I think he does. I mean, he's cool about it-
WILLOW: Of course he is. Cause' he's cool. He would never, you know
BUFFY: Push.
WILLOW: Right. He's not the type.
BUFFY: Willow. What am I going to do?
WILLOW: What do you want to do?
BUFFY: Well... <u>WANT</u> isn't always the right thing... To do, I mean. To act on want can be wrong.
WILLOW: True.
BUFFY: But, to not act on want. You could watch your whole life pass you by-  WILLOW Carpe diem. You told me that once.
BUFFY: Seize the fish?
WILLOW: Not carp. Carpe. It means seize the day.
BUFFY: Oh. Right. (a long beat) I think we're going to... seize it, Will. Sooner or later. Once you get to a certain point - seizing is sort of inevitable.
WILLOW: Wow.
BUFFY: Yeah.
WILLOW: Wow...
BUFFY: Ooh, speaking of wow potential, there's Oz. What are we thinking? Any sparkage there?
WILLOW: (glowing a bit) He's nice. I like his hands.
BUFFY: Ooh, fixation on insignificant detail. Definite crush sign.
WILLOW: I don't know, though. I mean, he is a senior...
BUFFY: You think he's too old cuz he's a senior? Please. My boyfriend had a bicentennial.
WILLOW: That's true, I guess... I just...
BUFFY: You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up  and smell the hottie. Make a move. Do the talking thing.
WILLOW: What if the talking thing becomes the awkward silence thing?
BUFFY: You won't know unless you try. Come on, Will - seize the fish!
WILLOW: Hey.
OZ: Hey.
WILLOW: (re: guitar case) Do you have a... a gig tonight?
OZ: Practice. The band's kind of moving towards this  new sound where we suck. So, practice.
WILLOW: I think you guys sound good. (shyly) I bet you've got a lot of groupies.
OZ: It happens. But I'm living groupie-free nowadays. I'm clean.
WILLOW: Oh.
OZ: I'm gonna ask you if you wanna go out tomorrow night. I'm actually kind of nervous about it. It's interesting.
WILLOW: Oh. Well, if it helps at all, I'm gonna say yes.
OZ: It helps. It adds a comfort zone. You wanna go out tomorrow night?
WILLOW: (remembers) I can't !
OZ: I like that you're unpredictable.
WILLOW: It's Buffy's birthday and we're throwing her a surprise party.
OZ: That's okay.
WILLOW: But, you could come. If you wanted.
OZ: Don't wanna crash...
WILLOW: No, that's fine. You could be my... date.
OZ: All right. I'm in.
WILLOW: I said date...
CORDELIA: Right. Just because she's "miss save the world" we have to make a big deal. I have to cook and everything.
XANDER: You're cooking?
CORDELIA: I'm chips, and dips girl.
XANDER: Horrors. All that opening and stirring.
CORDELIA: And shopping and carrying.
XANDER: You should have a person who does such things for you.
CORDELIA: That's what I've been saying to my father. But does he listen?
XANDER: So, you're going. I'm going. Should we - you know - go?
CORDELIA: Why?
XANDER: I don't know... This thing. With us? Despite our better judgement - it keeps happening. Maybe we should just admit that we're dating.
CORDELIA: Groping in a broom closet is not dating. You don't call it a date until the guy spends money.
XANDER: Fine. I'll spend - then we'll grope. Whatever. It's just some kind of whacked that we feel we have to hide from all our friends.
CORDELIA: Well, of course you want to tell everybody. You have nothing to be ashamed of. I, on the other hand, have <u>everything</u> to be ashamed of-  XANDER Know what? 'Nuff said. Forget it. Must have been my multiple personality guy talking. I call him Idiot Jed, Glutton for Punishment-
CORDELIA: Let me... Think about it. Can I pick out your clothes?  XANDER For the party?  CORDELIA For pretty much... every day.
GILES: Good morning. I trust that everything is in order for the party.  XANDER Absolutely. Ready to get down, you funky party weasel?
GILES: Ah. Here comes Buffy. Remember - discretion is the better part of valor...
XANDER: You could have just gone - "shhhh." Are all you Brits such drama queens?
XANDER: Buffy! I feel a pre-birthday spanking coming on.
JENNY: I'd - curb that impulse, Xander.  XANDER Check. Cancel spanking.  GILES What's the matter, Buffy? You look fatigued.
BUFFY: Rough night. I had a dream that Drusilla was alive - and she killed Angel. It really spun me. I even went by Angel's on the way to school to make sure he was okay.
BUFFY: Please. I didn't go over there for smootchies - (then) Well. When I found out he was okay I was relieved, and so, naturally... (then) Someone stop me.
JENNY: (obliging) So, Angel's alright?
BUFFY: Yeah, but... I've just got this bad feeling. This wasn't a normal dream.
GILES: You feel it was more of a portent?
BUFFY: I don't know. I don't want to start a big freak-out over nothing.  GILES Still. We should be on alert. If Drusilla is alive then we may be facing  a cataclysmic state of affairs-
XANDER: (to Giles) Again. So many words. Can't you just say we'd be in trouble?
GILES: Go to class, Xander.
XANDER: Gone.
XANDER: Notice the economy of phrasing. "Gone." It's simple. Direct.
BUFFY: I guess I should get gone, too.
GILES: Don't worry yourself unduly, Buffy. This could be nothing.
BUFFY: I know. I should keep my Slayer cool  and all, but, it's Angel. Which automatically  equals maxi-wig.
JENNY: What? You really think Buffy's having premonitions?
GILES: It's possible-
JENNY: I guess it makes sense. I mean, all of Buffy's senses are heightened.  Why should her intuition be different?
GILES: Precisely. It's not unheard of for the Slayer to start having prophetic dreams  and visions as she approaches adulthood-
JENNY: Adulthood? Buffy's seventeen tomorrow, Giles. Don't rush her.
GILES: I'm not the one rushing her. While I'm loathe to say it, the fact is -  the Slayer rarely lives into her mid-twenties. It follows that she'd  exhibit signs of maturity early on. Her whole life-cycle is accelerated.
JENNY: Still, you should be careful about treating her like a grown-up. Like -  this thing with Angel. Have you even talked to her about it?
GILES: I - I suppose I try not to pry.
JENNY: Maybe you should, a little. The way she talks - it's clear she has intense feelings for him  GILES Well, yes. They're friends-
JENNY: They're more than friends and you know it.
GILES: I'm not her father, Jenny.
JENNY: She looks up to you. She'll never actually say that, but she does.  And I just think, at her age, it's easy to get in. over your head.  She could make some bad choices here. Trust me on this one.
GILES: I'll keep an eye to it. Right now I'm worried enough trying to think of the right birthday present.
DALTON: I have your package.
SPIKE: Are you dead set on this, pet? Wouldn't you rather have your party in Vienna?
DRUSILLA: (pouty) But - the invitations are sent.
SPIKE: It's just, I've had it with this place. Nothing goes off the way its supposed to. 
DRUSILLA: -until my celebration. My gatherings are always perfect. Remember Spain? The bulls?
SPIKE: I remember, sweet. But Sunnydale is friggin' cursed for us. Angel and the Slayer see to that.
DRUSILLA: Shhhh. I have good games for everyone. You'll see.
DRUSILLA: These flowers are wrong. They're all wrong - I can't abide them!
SPIKE: Let's try something different with the flowers, then.
DRUSILLA: (suddenly excited) Can I open one? Can I? Can I?
SPIKE: Just a peek, love. They're for the party.
SPIKE: You like it, baby?
DRUSILLA: Oh, it reaks of death. This will be the best party ever.
SPIKE: Why's that?
DRUSILLA: Because it will be the last.
JOYCE: Mall trip for your birthday on Saturday. Don't forget.
BUFFY: Space on a mom-sponsored shopping opportunity? Not likely.
JOYCE: So, does seventeen feel any different than sixteen?
BUFFY: Funny you should ask - I actually woke up feeling more mature, responsible and level-headed.
JOYCE: (suspicious) Really? That's uncanny.
BUFFY: And yet, true. I now possess the qualities one looks for in a licensed driver.
JOYCE: Buffy.
BUFFY: You said we could talk about it again when I was seventeen.
JOYCE: You've been seventeen for forty-eight minutes.
BUFFY: And -
JOYCE: First of all - you promised you'd stay out of trouble in school.
BUFFY: I try. You know I do. But Principal Snyder has it in for me- 
JOYCE: I know. But... You behind the wheel, it worries me.
BUFFY: It worries all moms. It's biological imperative. But I'm going to drive sooner or later, so we might as well deal sooner - right?
JOYCE: Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?
JOYCE: Oh, damn it.
JOYCE:  JOYCE Grab the broom, would you Buffy?
JENNY: You startled me.
MAN: You look well. Comfortable.
JENNY: Yes. I'm fine. I - I know I haven't written as much lately. I've been busy-
MAN: I cannot imagine what is so important that you ignore your responsibility to your people.
JENNY: I've been working. And... distracted. I'm sorry.
MAN: The elder woman has been reading signs. Something is different.
JENNY: Nothing's changed. The curse still holds. He's still tortured by all that he's done-
MAN: No. The elder woman is never wrong. She says his pain is lessening. She feels it.
JENNY: There is...
MAN: There is - what?
JENNY: (with difficulty) A girl.
MAN: What? How could you let this happen?
JENNY: I promise you. Angel still suffers. And he makes amends for his evil. He even saved my life.
MAN: So you just forget? That he destroyed the most beloved daughter of your  tribe? That he killed every man, woman and child who touched her life? (then) Vengeance demands that his pain be eternal, as ours is. If this - this girl -  brings him even one minute of happiness. That is one minute too many.
JENNY: I'm sorry. I thought-
MAN: What? That you are Jenny Calendar now? You are still Janna, of the Kalderash people. A gypsy.
JENNY: I know, Uncle. I know...
MAN: Then prove it. Your time for watching is past. The girl and him - it ends now. No matter what you must do, take her from him.
JENNY: I - I will see to it.
MAN: Good.
CORDELIA: (too casual) Hello. I'm having, like, a totally random thought... (then) Xander Harris. Is it just me, or does his shirt almost match his pants?
HARMONY: Almost. Why do I care?
CORDELIA: Well. If you look at him a certain way - is he vaguely.., cute?
HARMONY: Oh yeah. I'm hot for spaz boy. Are you tripping, Cordelia?
CORDELIA: You thought I was serious? Please. I was just testing you! Ha. (sighs) I'm hot for spaz boy. Good one.
WILLOW: So we're all set. I've got all the decorations. And I think Cordelia's bringing snacks and stuff.
XANDER: Yeah. She said she was. Which was thoughtful. Don't you think? (takes the leap) Hey. Cordelia: not as horrible a person as we once thought? I mean, she's obviously trying to be helpful.
WILLOW: True. (considers) Maybe...
XANDER: But, you wouldn't ever, like, be able to be friends with her or something.  WILLOW You mean, like hang out and take Cosmo tests together?  XANDER I mean - actually elect to be in her presence.
WILLOW: I don't know. She's better - but she's still Cordelia. (nods to the hall) Just... look.
WILLOW: Example: what is the shrieking thing? They just saw each other yesterday... And now, watch - Cordelia's going to model her new outfit-
WILLOW: Note the reaction -  like Cordelia invented clothes. (then) They're not bad people, Xander. It's just - we are of two worlds. (can't help herself) And theirs is bad.
XANDER: Right. Of course you're right. What was I thinking?
OZ: Hey.
WILLOW: Hey. So - tonight?
OZ: I'm there. Feeling surprise-y. (then) Can I pick you up?
WILLOW: Yeah. That would be... Here-
OZ: (pleased) I have your address.
WILLOW: You do.
OZ: Excellent.
XANDER: Is this a date?
WILLOW: (distracted) Hmmm...? (then) Yeah. It's a date.
XANDER: Shouldn't you meet him or something? Are you sure you should be giving some stranger your address?
WILLOW: He's not just some stranger, Xander. He's a friend. He took a bullet for me.
XANDER: So? I would've taken a bullet for you. Nobody offered me one.
BUFFY: -and then my mom broke the plate. It was exactly like I saw it in my  dream, Giles. Every gesture. Every word. Beyond creepy.
GILES: Yes. I'd imagine-
XANDER: Hey! The woman of the hour.
WILLOW: It's happy birthday Buffy!
WILLOW: Not - happy birthday Buffy?
GILES: It's just... A piece of the nightmare Buffy had the other night  actually came to pass.
XANDER: Something happen to Angel?
BUFFY: He's fine. For now. But if part of what I had a dream about came true-
WILLOW: Then all of it may come true.
BUFFY: And Drusilla might be alive. (then/to Giles) In the dream, I couldn't stop her. She blind-sided me, Giles. Angel was dead before I knew what happened
GILES: Even if she is alive, we can still protect Angel. Dreams are not prophecies, Buffy. You dreamt the Master had risen, but you stopped it from happening.
XANDER: You ground his bones to make your bread.
BUFFY: That's true, except for the bread part. I guess we're one step ahead. But Giles, I'd like to stay that way.
GILES: Absolutely. Let me read up on Drusilla, see if she has any particular patterns. Why don't you meet me here at 7:00? Map out a strategy.
BUFFY: Okay. What do I do till then?
GILES: Go to class.., do your homework... Have supper...
BUFFY: Oh, right. Be <u>that</u> Buffy.
XANDER: That is <u>not</u> a perky birthday puppy.
WILLOW: So much for our surprise party.
XANDER: Man. This Slayer gig is 24/7. Can't even stop for a little pinata-bashing.
WILLOW: I bought little hats and everything. Oh well, I'll tell Cordelia.  GILES No, you won't. We're having a party tonight.
XANDER: It looks like Mr. Caution Man talking, but the sound he makes is funny.
GILES: Buffy's surprise party is going to go exactly as we've planned. (to Willow) Except I won't be wearing the little hat.
XANDER: He has dignity.
WILLOW: But Buffy and Angel - 
GILES: -May well be in danger. As they have been before, and, I imagine, will be again. One thing I have learned in my tenure here on the Hellmouth is that there is never a good time to relax. But Buffy is only turning 17 this once. She deserves a party.
XANDER: You're a great man of our time.
WILLOW: And anyway, Angel's coming . So she'll be able to protect him <u>and</u> have cake.
GILES: Precisely.
JENNY: Buffy.
BUFFY: God. I didn't see you there.
JENNY: Sorry... Giles wanted me to tell you that there's been a change of plans. He wants to meet you someplace near his house. I guess he had to run home and get a book or something.
BUFFY: Yeah, 'cause heaven knows there aren't enough books in the library-
JENNY: He's - very thorough.
BUFFY: Which is not to bag. It's kinda manly in an obsessive/compulsive sorta way,  don't you think?
JENNY: I have my car. I can drive, if you want...
BUFFY: Okay...
BUFFY: So - where are we headed, anyway?
BUFFY: We're going to the Bronze?
JENNY: I'm not sure. Giles gave me an address. I'm just following his directions -
BUFFY: Uh oh.
JENNY: What?
BUFFY: This looks funky. Stop for a sec.
JENNY: Buffy - maybe you shouldn't.
BUFFY: Sorry. Sacred duty, yadda, yadda, yadda
JENNY: (to herself) What is this...?
BUFFY: Every time I see you you're stealing something. You should talk to  somebody about this klepto issue.
ANGEL: Where is she?
WILLOW: Shhh! I think I hear her coming-
CORDELIA: Surprise!
OZ: That pretty much sums it up.
ANGEL: Buffy, are you okay?
GILES: Yes - what happened?
BUFFY: There were these vamps in the alley. And one of Dru's guys was- (stops - notices) What's going on?  GILES (a bit lamely) Surprise party.
CORDELIA: Yeah, happy birthday.
BUFFY: You guys did all this for me? You are so sweet!
ANGEL: You're sure you're okay?
BUFFY: I'm fine.
WILLOW: Are <u>you</u> okay?
OZ: Yeah. Did everybody else see a guy turn into dust?
WILLOW: Uh, sort of...
XANDER: Yep. Vampires are real, lot of 'em live in Sunnydale,  Willow'll fill you in.
WILLOW: I know it's hard to accept at first...
OZ: No, actually, it explains a lot.
JENNY: Can somebody give me a hand here?
JENNY: Those creeps left this behind.
BUFFY: What is it?
GILES: I have no idea. Can it be opened?
BUFFY: It feels like it has some kind of release... There.
XANDER: Clearly - the Hellmouth's answer to "what do you get the Slayer who has everything?"
GILES: Good heavens, Buffy, are you alright?
BUFFY: Man. That thing had major grip-
WILLOW: What - what was that?
OZ: (matter of fact) Looked like an arm.
ANGEL: It can't be- She wouldn't...
XANDER: What? The vamp version of "snakes in a can?" Or do you care to share?
BUFFY: Angel?
ANGEL: It's a legend. Way before my time. Of a demon brought forth to rid  the earth of the plague of humanity. To separate the righteous from  the wicked... And burn the righteous down. They called him the Judge.
GILES: The Judge... This is he?
ANGEL: Well, not all of him...
BUFFY: Uh, still needing backstory here...
GILES: He couldn't be killed.
GILES: An army was sent against him. Most of them died, but they were  finally able to dismember him. But not kill him.
ANGEL: The pieces were scattered - buried in every corner of the earth.
OZ: (aside to Xander) I had that thought too.
JENNY: So all these parts are being brought here.
BUFFY: By Drusilla. The vamps outside were Spike's men.
ANGEL: She's just crazy enough to do it.
WILLOW: Do what? Reassemble the Judge?
ANGEL: And bring forth Armageddon.
CORDELIA: Is anyone else gonna have cake?
GILES: We have to get this out of town.
JENNY: Angel.
BUFFY: What?
JENNY: You've got to do it. You're the only one who can protect this thing.
BUFFY: What about me?
JENNY: You're just gonna skip town for a few months?
BUFFY: Months?
ANGEL: She's right. I have to take this to the remotest region possible.
BUFFY: But that's not months.
ANGEL: I can catch a cargo ship to Asia, maybe trek to Nepal...
BUFFY: (to Angel) You know - those wacky, newfangled flying machines are much safer than they used to be...
ANGEL: I can't fly. There's no sure way to guard against the daylight. (then) I don't like this any more than you do, Buffy. But there's no other way.
BUFFY: When?
ANGEL: Tonight. As soon as possible.
BUFFY: (pathetic) But - it's my birthday.
JENNY: I'll drive you to the docks.
DRUSILLA: You <u>lost</u> it? You lost my present?
DALTON: I know... I'm sorry-
SPIKE: Bad turn, man. She can't have her fun without the box.
DALTON: The Slayer, she came out of nowhere. I - I didn't even see her.
DRUSILLA: (sweetly) Make a wish.
DALTON: What?
DRUSILLA: I'm going to blow out the candles
SPIKE: (casually) Dru, sweet. You might give him a chance to find your lost treasure.  He's a wanker, but he's the only one we've got with half a brain.  If he fails - you can eat his eyes out of the sockets for all I care.
DALTON: I'll get it. Please. I swear.
DRUSILLA: (sweet again) Hurry back, then.
ANGEL: I should go the rest of the way alone.
BUFFY: Okay...
ANGEL: I'll be back.
ANGEL: I will.
BUFFY: When? Six months? A year? Who knows how long it will take. Or if we'll even-
ANGEL: If we'll even - what?
BUFFY: Just, if you haven't noticed, someone pretty much always wants us dead.
ANGEL: Don't say that. We'll be fine.
BUFFY: But we don't know.
ANGEL: We can't know, Buffy. Nobody can. That's just the deal.
ANGEL: I... have something for you. For your birthday. I was going to give it to  you earlier, but...
BUFFY: It's beautiful.
ANGEL: My people... Before I was changed, they exchanged this as a sign of devotion. (then) It's a Claddagh ring. The hands represent friendship, the crown represents loyalty. The heart, well, you know... Wear it with the heart pointing toward you, it means you belong to somebody.
ANGEL: Like this.
BUFFY: Angel-
ANGEL: Put it on.
BUFFY: I don't want to do this.
ANGEL: Me either.
BUFFY: (small) So - don't go.
ANGEL: Buffy... I-
BUFFY: (seeing Dalton) Angel! The box!
ANGEL: Buffy!?
GILES: They should be back by now...
WILLOW: Maybe Buffy needed a few minutes to pull herself together. (then) Poor Buffy. On her birthday and everything.
XANDER: It's sad. Granted. But let's look at the up-side for a moment. I mean, what kind of future could she have really had with him? Working two jobs. Denny's waitress by day, Slayer by night. Angel's always in front of the tube, with a big ole' blood belly... And he's dreaming of the glory days when Buffy still thought the whole creature of the night routine was a big turn-on...
WILLOW: You've thought way too much about this-
XANDER: That's just the beginning. You want to hear the part where I fly into town in my private jet and take Buffy out for prime rib?
WILLOW: Xander -
XANDER: And she cries?
GILES: What happened?
BUFFY: Dru's guys ambushed us. They got the box.
GILES: Where's Jenny?
BUFFY: She took Angel to his apartment to get clothes. I had some here.
XANDER: And we were needing clothes because.
BUFFY: We got wet. Giles, what do we know?
GILES: The more I study the Judge, the less I like him. His touch can literally burn the humanity out of you. A true creature of evil can survive the process. No human ever has.
XANDER: So what's the problem? We send Cordy to fight this guy and we  go for pizza.
BUFFY: Can he be stopped? Without an army?
GILES: (reads) "No weapon forged can kill him." Not very encouraging. But if we  can keep them from assembling him...
BUFFY: We need to find his weak spots. And we need to figure out where they'd be keeping him.
GILES: This could take time.
WILLOW: We better do a round robin. Xander, you go first.
BUFFY: Good call.
GILES: Round robin?
WILLOW: Everybody calls everybody's mom and tells them they're at everybody else's house.
BUFFY: Thus freeing us up for world savage.
WILLOW: And all-night keggers. (off looks) What, only Xander gets to make dumb jokes?
XANDER: Hey, mom. Listen, Willow and I are studying,  I'm gonna stay over here... uh huh...
XANDER: (tired) I think I read this already...
WILLOW: I can't get over how cool Oz was about all this.
XANDER: Gee, <u>I'm</u> over it.
WILLOW: You're just jealous cuz you didn't have a date for the party.
XANDER: No, I sure didn't...
GILES: It seems Buffy needed some rest.
ANGEL: Yeah. She hasn't been sleeping well. You know, tossing and turning.
ANGEL: She <u>told</u> me. Because of her dreams.
BUFFY: Hello? Who is that?
BUFFY: No!
BUFFY: No! Angel!-
ANGEL: It's okay...
ANGEL: I'm here. I'm right here.
DRUSILLA: More music!
SPIKE: Look what I have for you, ducks.
DRUSILLA: Ah! The best is saved for last.
DRUSILLA: He's perfect, my darling... (darkly) Just what I wanted.
SPIKE: I'd let our guest make the first move, precious.
JUDGE: You...
SPIKE: Ho! Ho! What's that, mate?
JUDGE: You two stink of humanity. You share affection. Jealousy...
SPIKE: Yeah, what of it? Do I have to remind you that we're the ones that brought you here?
JUDGE: I have no alliances.
SPIKE: Right then. You want to go back in the little boxes?
JUDGE: You may live. You will help me serve my purpose.   SPIKE (grins) Works for me.
DRUSILLA: Would you like a party favor?
JUDGE: This one - is full of feeling. (disgusted) He reads.
JUDGE: Bring him to me.
JUDGE: My full strength will return, in time. Until then - I need contact.
JUDGE: Silence...
DRUSILLA: Do it again! Do it again!
GILES: Buffy? Are you alright?
ANGEL: She had another dream.
BUFFY: I think I know where Drusilla and Spike are-
GILES: Very good. However, you need a plan. I know you're concerned, Buffy, but you can't just go off half-cocked.
BUFFY: We have a plan. Angel and I go to the factory to do recon. See how far they've gotten assembling the Judge. You guys fan out and check places the boxes may be coming into town. Ship yards, the airport...  We have to stop them from getting all the boxes in one place-
GILES: (nonplussed) Yes, well... That's quite a good plan, actually.
BUFFY: This thing is nasty and it's real, Giles. We don't have time to wait  for it to come get us.
BUFFY: Angel. Maybe I should go in alone. I mean, if my dreams are so true-
ANGEL: (firmly) I'm not letting you go by yourself.
BUFFY: Okay - what do we do if the Judge is already put together?
ANGEL: I'll deal with it. You keep your distance.
BUFFY: We're going to have to get over this virtuous thing or we're dead meat.
ANGEL: (she's right) If he's assembled, we retreat. Together. Get the others and make a battle plan.
BUFFY: Deal.
BUFFY: (whispering) I saw this. The party...
DRUSILLA: What? What is it?
ANGEL: We have to get out of here-
SPIKE: Well, well. Look what we have here - crashers.
BUFFY: I'm sure our invitations just got lost in the mail-
DRUSILLA: It's delicious. I only dreamed you'd come.
ANGEL: Leave her alone-
SPIKE: (to Angel/wry) Yeah, that'll work. Now say pretty please -
JUDGE: The girl.
DRUSILLA: Chilling, isn't it? She's so full of good intention.
ANGEL: Take me. Take me instead of her.
SPIKE: You're not clear on the concept, pal. There is no "instead". Just <u>first</u> and <u>second</u>
DRUSILLA: And if you go first - you don't get to watch the Slayer die.
ANGEL: No, Buffy - don't touch him!
BUFFY: This way-
DRUSILLA: Stop them!
BUFFY: I think we lost them-
ANGEL: Come on. You need to get inside.
JENNY: Well that was a big zero. No box, no, vamps.
GILES: Perhaps you ought to go home and get some sleep. I'll continue from here.
JENNY: Like I could sleep, Giles.
GILES: Yes, I feel rather restless myself. Buffy and Angel can handle  themselves, of course, but...
JENNY: I know. I'm worried too.
ANGEL: You're shaking like a leaf.
BUFFY: Cold.
ANGEL: Let me get you something.
ANGEL: Put these on and get under the covers. Just to warm up.
ANGEL: Sorry.
ANGEL: What?
BUFFY: I - I got cut or something on my back.
ANGEL: Can ... Let me see.
BUFFY: Okay.
ANGEL: It's already closed. You're fine.
BUFFY: You almost went away today-
ANGEL: We both did.
BUFFY: Angel. I feel, like - If I lost you... (then) But you're right. We can't be sure. About anything-
ANGEL: Shhhhh. I-
BUFFY: You - what?
ANGEL: I love you. (pained) I try not to, but I can't stop-
BUFFY: Me too. I can't either.
ANGEL: Buffy. Maybe we shouldn't-
BUFFY: Don't. Just... kiss me
ANGEL: Buffy..
