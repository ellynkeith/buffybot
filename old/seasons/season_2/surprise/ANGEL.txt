Hey... Everything okay?
Sure. I'm fine. What's up?
What happened?
It was just a dream. It wasn't real.
It wasn't. Here I am.
Still, not every dream you have comes true. I mean, what else did you dream last night? Can you remember?
You see my point.
She's not. But even if she was - we'd deal.
What if what?
I know.
You have to go to school...
You still haven't told me what you want for your birthday.
Okay. I will...
It's bed time for me.
Yeah. It is.
Where is she?
Buffy, are you okay?
You're sure you're okay?
It can't be- She wouldn't...
It's a legend. Way before my time. Of a demon brought forth to rid  the earth of the plague of humanity. To separate the righteous from  the wicked... And burn the righteous down. They called him the Judge.
Well, not all of him...
The pieces were scattered - buried in every corner of the earth.
She's just crazy enough to do it.
And bring forth Armageddon.
She's right. I have to take this to the remotest region possible.
I can catch a cargo ship to Asia, maybe trek to Nepal...
I can't fly. There's no sure way to guard against the daylight. (then) I don't like this any more than you do, Buffy. But there's no other way.
Tonight. As soon as possible.
I should go the rest of the way alone.
I'll be back.
I will.
If we'll even - what?
Don't say that. We'll be fine.
We can't know, Buffy. Nobody can. That's just the deal.
I... have something for you. For your birthday. I was going to give it to  you earlier, but...
My people... Before I was changed, they exchanged this as a sign of devotion. (then) It's a Claddagh ring. The hands represent friendship, the crown represents loyalty. The heart, well, you know... Wear it with the heart pointing toward you, it means you belong to somebody.
Like this.
Put it on.
Me either.
Buffy... I-
Buffy!?
Yeah. She hasn't been sleeping well. You know, tossing and turning.
She <u>told</u> me. Because of her dreams.
It's okay...
I'm here. I'm right here.
She had another dream.
(firmly) I'm not letting you go by yourself.
I'll deal with it. You keep your distance.
(she's right) If he's assembled, we retreat. Together. Get the others and make a battle plan.
We have to get out of here-
Leave her alone-
Take me. Take me instead of her.
No, Buffy - don't touch him!
Come on. You need to get inside.
You're shaking like a leaf.
Let me get you something.
Put these on and get under the covers. Just to warm up.
Sorry.
What?
Can ... Let me see.
It's already closed. You're fine.
We both did.
Shhhhh. I-
I love you. (pained) I try not to, but I can't stop-
Buffy. Maybe we shouldn't-
Buffy..
