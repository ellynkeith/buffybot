You're cooking?
Horrors. All that opening and stirring.
You should have a person who does such things for you.
So, you're going. I'm going. Should we - you know - go?
I don't know... This thing. With us? Despite our better judgement - it keeps happening. Maybe we should just admit that we're dating.
Fine. I'll spend - then we'll grope. Whatever. It's just some kind of whacked that we feel we have to hide from all our friends.
You could have just gone - "shhhh." Are all you Brits such drama queens?
Buffy! I feel a pre-birthday spanking coming on.
(to Giles) Again. So many words. Can't you just say we'd be in trouble?
Gone.
Notice the economy of phrasing. "Gone." It's simple. Direct.
Yeah. She said she was. Which was thoughtful. Don't you think? (takes the leap) Hey. Cordelia: not as horrible a person as we once thought? I mean, she's obviously trying to be helpful.
But, you wouldn't ever, like, be able to be friends with her or something.  WILLOW You mean, like hang out and take Cosmo tests together?  XANDER I mean - actually elect to be in her presence.
Right. Of course you're right. What was I thinking?
Is this a date?
Shouldn't you meet him or something? Are you sure you should be giving some stranger your address?
So? I would've taken a bullet for you. Nobody offered me one.
Hey! The woman of the hour.
Something happen to Angel?
You ground his bones to make your bread.
That is <u>not</u> a perky birthday puppy.
Man. This Slayer gig is 24/7. Can't even stop for a little pinata-bashing.
It looks like Mr. Caution Man talking, but the sound he makes is funny.
He has dignity.
You're a great man of our time.
Yep. Vampires are real, lot of 'em live in Sunnydale,  Willow'll fill you in.
Clearly - the Hellmouth's answer to "what do you get the Slayer who has everything?"
What? The vamp version of "snakes in a can?" Or do you care to share?
It's sad. Granted. But let's look at the up-side for a moment. I mean, what kind of future could she have really had with him? Working two jobs. Denny's waitress by day, Slayer by night. Angel's always in front of the tube, with a big ole' blood belly... And he's dreaming of the glory days when Buffy still thought the whole creature of the night routine was a big turn-on...
That's just the beginning. You want to hear the part where I fly into town in my private jet and take Buffy out for prime rib?
And she cries?
And we were needing clothes because.
So what's the problem? We send Cordy to fight this guy and we  go for pizza.
Hey, mom. Listen, Willow and I are studying,  I'm gonna stay over here... uh huh...
(tired) I think I read this already...
Gee, <u>I'm</u> over it.
No, I sure didn't...
