Happy Birthday, Buffy.
(pouty) But - the invitations are sent.
-until my celebration. My gatherings are always perfect. Remember Spain? The bulls?
Shhhh. I have good games for everyone. You'll see.
These flowers are wrong. They're all wrong - I can't abide them!
(suddenly excited) Can I open one? Can I? Can I?
Oh, it reaks of death. This will be the best party ever.
Because it will be the last.
You <u>lost</u> it? You lost my present?
(sweetly) Make a wish.
I'm going to blow out the candles
(sweet again) Hurry back, then.
More music!
Ah! The best is saved for last.
He's perfect, my darling... (darkly) Just what I wanted.
Would you like a party favor?
Do it again! Do it again!
What? What is it?
It's delicious. I only dreamed you'd come.
Chilling, isn't it? She's so full of good intention.
And if you go first - you don't get to watch the Slayer die.
Stop them!
