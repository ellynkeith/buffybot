You...
You two stink of humanity. You share affection. Jealousy...
I have no alliances.
You may live. You will help me serve my purpose.   SPIKE (grins) Works for me.
This one - is full of feeling. (disgusted) He reads.
Bring him to me.
My full strength will return, in time. Until then - I need contact.
Silence...
The girl.
