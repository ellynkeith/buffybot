Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?
Mall trip for your birthday on Saturday. Don't forget.
So, does seventeen feel any different than sixteen?
(suspicious) Really? That's uncanny.
Buffy.
You've been seventeen for forty-eight minutes.
First of all - you promised you'd stay out of trouble in school.
I know. But... You behind the wheel, it worries me.
Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?
Oh, damn it.
 JOYCE Grab the broom, would you Buffy?
