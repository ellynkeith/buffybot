A visit from the pointed-tooth fairy.
Ya know, I think there may be a valuable lesson for you gals here about inviting strange men into your bedrooms…
Yep. Now you're doomed to having to give him and his vamp pals a lift whenever they feel like it. And  those guys never chip in for gas.
Hel-<u>lo</u>… excuse me, but have you ever heard of knocking?
Does this look like a Barnes and Noble?
(innocently) Since when?
So… about-ay ee-thay ampire-vay… (off looks) Allway-hay?
The "nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah" approach to battle.
(to Buffy) Your mom…
Yeah. The more people who know the secret,  the more it cheapens it for the rest of us.
There you go. You Zen, you win.
Hey, how come Buffy doesn't get a snotty "once again you boil it down to its simplest form" thing? (then, to Buffy) Watcher's pet.
Well, good morning, ladies. And what did  you two do last night?
Ah, and I don't suppose either of you had the presence of mind to locate a camera to capture the moment?
No luck. By the time we got to the station, the cops said he'd already left. I guess they just wanted to ask him some questions.
(harsh) Because Angel's a blood-sucking coward. They pick on the harmless.
Hello…? Giles…?
(re: album cover) Looks like Giles had big plans for the night.
Oh, man. Poor Giles.
Those are his everyday weapons. These were his "good" weapons. The ones he only breaks out when company comes to visit.
(bitter) Well, it's about time somebody did.
(with attitude) I'm sorry. But let's not forget that I hated Angel  long before all of <u>you</u> guys jumped on the  bandwagon. So, I think I deserve something  for not saying "I told you so" long before now.  And, if Giles wants to go after the… fiend who  murdered his girlfriend, I say "Faster, Pussycat. Kill. Kill."
Thank you.
And, what's that?
