As long as the Slayer is alive, whoever takes his place will be sharing his grave!
Saint Vigeous, you who murdered so many, we beseech you, cleans us of our weaknesses: mercy, compassion and pity.
Spike? He, uh, said he doesn't go  for religion.
He's with the woman. He's always with the woman.
We cut the power, nobody got out.
She either went that wayâ€¦
Spike!
Listen.
Penance? You should lay down your life! Our numbers are depleted. The  Feast of St. Vigeous has been ruined  by your impatience.
