Heard Snyder's got you guys making party favors.
Sheila's definitely intense. That guy with her? That's the one she CAN  bring home to her mother.
You're bad to the bone.
Homework. She won't do it. And most of the teachers respect that now. You'll probably want to keep her away from  sharp implements while you're working.
Hey, it's no biggie. You'll put on a nice little affair. The parents'll love it. As long as nothing really bad comes along between now and then, you'll be fine.

You know about this Spike guy so, uh, you got a plan?
I knew you were a lying… undead liar guy.
No!
So when you were giving him my neck to chew on, how come you didn't clock him before he clocked you?
And if he bit me, then what?
