SNYDER: …think of your principal as your "pal".  I say think of me as your judge, jury  and executioner.
SHEILA: I never stabbed anyone with a trowel!
SNYDER: (to Buffy) On the other hand, Sheila's never burned down a school building.
BUFFY: That was never proved… the fire marshal said it could have been…  mice…
SNYDER: Mice?
BUFFY: Mice that were smoking?
SNYDER: (looking at file) And the two of you seem to be tied in the class-cutting and fight-starting  events. You're really neck and neck here. It's very exciting.
SHEILA: What does the winner get?
SNYDER: Expelled.
BUFFY: We're clear. (to Sheila) Don't you feel clear? (to Snyder) We're very clear.
SNYDER: Good. Because you mess up this time, and your parents will be coming to clean out your lockers.
BUFFY: It really shouldn't be that hard.  We'll work on banners tomorrow at  lunch and we can figure out  refreshments then.
SHEILA: Yeah, sure, whatever.
XANDER: Heard Snyder's got you guys making party favors.
BUFFY: Yeah, his two worst students. (watching Sheila) When my Mom looks at me, that what she sees. A Sheila.
XANDER: Sheila's definitely intense. That guy with her? That's the one she CAN  bring home to her mother.
WILLOW: She smoked when we were in fifth grade. Once I was lookout for her.
XANDER: You're bad to the bone.
WILLOW: I'm a rebel.
BUFFY: It's just not fair. I'm the Slayer, which requires a certain amount of fighting and cutting. What's Sheila's excuse?
XANDER: Homework. She won't do it. And most of the teachers respect that now. You'll probably want to keep her away from  sharp implements while you're working.
BUFFY: Do you think any of the other Slayers ever had to go to high school?
XANDER: Hey, it's no biggie. You'll put on a nice little affair. The parents'll love it. As long as nothing really bad comes along between now and then, you'll be fine.
BUFFY: Are you nuts? What'd you say that for? Now something bad is gonna happen!
XANDER: What do you mean? Nothing is gonna happen!
WILLOW: Not until some dummy says "As long  as nothing bad happens…"
BUFFY: That's like the ultimate jinx!
WILLOW: What were you thinking? Or were you  even thinking?
XANDER: (defensively) Well, you don't know. Maybe this time is different.
SPIKE: Home sweet home.
UGLY: The Master is dead. Someone has to take his place.
BOY: As long as the Slayer is alive, whoever takes his place will be sharing his grave!
UGLY: Then let the soul who kills her wear his mantle.
ONE: Can you do it?
UGLY: Yes. This weekend, the Night of Saint Vigeous, our power shall be at it's peak! When I kill her, it'll be the  greatest event since the crucifixion.  And I should know. I was there.
SPIKE: You were there? Oh please.
UGLY: I ought to rip your throat out.
SPIKE: Would it kill ya', little mouthwash every couple hundred years?
ONE: Who are you?
SPIKE: Spike. You're that anointed guy. I read about you. And you got Slayer problems. You know what I find works real good with Slayers? Killing them.
ONE: Can you?
SPIKE: A lot faster than fatboy here. (to Big Ugly, who chokes and grunts) Doncha' think? (more gagging: to the Anointed) He agrees. Where was I? Oh yeah, I did a couple Slayers in my time. Don't like to brag. Oh, who am I kidding, I love to brag. There was one Slayer, during the Boxer Rebellion -
DRUSILLA: Look at all the people. Are these  nice people?
SPIKE: We're getting along.
DRUSILLA: This one has power. I could feel it from outside.
SPIKE: Yeah, he's a big noise in these parts. Anointed, and all that.
DRUSILLA: (to the Anointed One) Do you like daisies? I plant them but they always die. Everything I put in the ground withers and dies. Spike, I'm cold.
SPIKE: I got you.
DRUSILLA: I'm a princess…
SPIKE: That's what you are.
DRUSILLA: I can't see her. The Slayer. I can't  see. It's dark where she is… Kill  her! Spike! Kill her for me!
SPIKE: It's done, baby.
DRUSILLA: (calm, but shaking) Kill her for princess?
SPIKE: I'll chop her into pieces.
DRUSILLA: You are my sweet.
SPIKE: (to the Anointed One) So, how about this Slayer. Is she tough?
BUFFY: Ow!
JOYCE: What's wrong?
BUFFY: I spent half my allowance on that  new cream rinse and it's neither  creamy nor rinsey.
JOYCE: Life is hard, dear.
BUFFY: Don't I know it. Look at these split ends!
JOYCE: I got the mail.
BUFFY: Oh good.
JOYCE: Which included a reminder notice about parent teacher night Thursday.
BUFFY: Oh less good.
JOYCE: Which your were planning on telling me about…?
BUFFY: For the last two weeks. I've been working up my nerve.
JOYCE: Uh huh. So what do you think your teachers will tell me about you?
BUFFY: Well… I… think they'd all agree I always bring a pen to class, ready to absorb the knowledge.
JOYCE: And this absorption rate, how is it reflected in your homework and test scores?
BUFFY: What can you really tell about a person from a test score?
JOYCE: Whether or not she's ever going out with her friends again.
BUFFY: Oh that.
JOYCE: What about your principal?
BUFFY: He put me in charge of the banners  and refreshments for the whole  evening. If that's not a sign of  respect I don't know what is.
JOYCE: I look forward to meeting him.
BUFFY: Won't that be something.
JOYCE: Look, sweetheart, life is more than grades and test scores and not getting kicked out of school.
BUFFY: You are so right.
JOYCE: But we moved once because of you getting in trouble. And I had to start a new business - not to mention a new life - in a whole new town.
BUFFY: And you don't want to do that again.
JOYCE: What I don't want is to be  disappointed in you again.
BUFFY: Mom, believe me, that's the last thing I want, too. I'm trying, I've just got a lot of… pressure right now.
JOYCE: Wait till you have a job.
BUFFY: I have a job.
WILLOW: Sheila's a no show? (Buffy nods) She goes to this really rank bar, the Fish Tank, sometimes they have raids and… other things that could make you tardy.
BUFFY: Can you help me cram some French tonight? I don't want Mr. DeJean telling my mother I'm an… (big French accent) …imbecile!
WILLOW: I thought we were going to the Bronze tonight. 'Cause of how you thought Angel might show.
XANDER: If he does he'll meet some other nice girl. Studying comes first.
BUFFY: We're going to the Bronze. I can study and party and do parent teacher night and make my mother proud as long  as I don't have to… (sees Giles and Jenny coming; deflates) …fight vampires.
GILES: There's nothing in the Chronicles about an extraneous lunar cycle.
JENNY: The Order never accurately calculated the Mesopotamian calendar! Rupert, you have to read something that was published AFTER 1066.
XANDER: What's the up, guys?
BUFFY: I don't suppose this is something about happy squirrels?
GILES: Vampires.
BUFFY: That was my next guess.
GILES: Ms. Calendar has been researching - surfing on her computer. According to her calendar, this Saturday is the  Night of Saint Vigeous.
BUFFY: Lemme guess. He didn't make balloon animals.
GILES: He led a crusade. Of vampires. They swept through Edessa, Harran, and points east.
JENNY: They didn't leave much behind.
XANDER: So Saturday's kind of a big doo for bloodsuckers.
JENNY: It's a Holy Night of Attack. They'll come in numbers.
BUFFY: If I survive parent teacher night tomorrow… (nods at banner) …I'll see what I can do about  Saturday.
GILES: You're being a tad flip, don't you think? This is serious.
BUFFY: And being kicked out of school is laffs aplenty?
GILES: You know what happens when you let your life interfere with your slaying.
BUFFY: Yes, I found that out the last time I had a date, back in the Restoration era.
GILES: You just need to keep the two things separate.
BUFFY: Yes, well, if my slaying doesn't get me expelled, I promise my banner making won't get me killed. Just let me get through the week.
GILES: Saturday will require a great deal of preparation.
WILLOW: Well, we'll help.
XANDER: Yeah! I can whittle stakes!
WILLOW: And I can research stuff.
XANDER: (to Willow) While I'm whittling, I plan to whistle a jaunty tune.
GILES: Your help will be appreciated. But when it comes to battle, Buffy must be prepared to fight alone. You are,  after all, a slay-
GILES: slay…ve. Slave. You're all slaves to the… television. You young people nowadays. Goodbye.
SNYDER: You wouldn't be helping Buffy in Sheila's place would you?
XANDER: (brush behind back) No.
WILLOW: We're hindering.
SNYDER: She ditched. Mmm-mmmm, I feel an expulsion coming on.
BUFFY: She's been helping for hours. She's just out getting more paint…
SNYDER: Just make sure everything is perfect on Thursday.
SHEILA: Thanks for covering. Guy's a serious rodent.
BUFFY: No problem.
SHEILA: Did you really burn down school property one time?
BUFFY: Well, not actually ONE time…
SHEILA: Cool.
BUFFY: But I didn't feel good about it or anything. I mean, I don't condone… So. We're gonna Bronze it tonight, if you wanted to come.
SHEILA: I can't go there. You threaten one bartender with a broken bottle and they like ban you for life. (snorts)
BUFFY: Ahhh.
BUFFY: &lt;La vache doit me touche de la jeudi&gt; (off Willow's furrowing brow) Is that wrong? Should I use the plural?
WILLOW: No, but… you just said that "the cow should touch me from Thursday".
BUFFY: Well, maybe that's what I was feeling.
WILLOW: And you said it wrong.
BUFFY: Oh. Je stink.
WILLOW: You're just not focused. It's Angel missage.
BUFFY: Well he didn't say for sure, it was a maybe see you there kind of deal.
XANDER: Guys! I'm all alone out there! Somebody has to dance with me.
WILLOW: Well, we are studying…
XANDER: Come on, one dance! You've been studying for nearly twelve minutes!
BUFFY: No wonder my brain is fried.
SPIKE: Go get something to eat.
SPIKE: Where's a phone. I need to call the police. There's some big guy out back trying to bite someone.
UGLY: <u>Slayer</u>.
BUFFY: Slay-ee.
BUFFY: (re: girl) Get her out of here!
XANDER: Ahhh!
UGLY: I don't need to wait for Saint Vigeous. You're mine!
SPIKE: Nice work, baby.
BUFFY: Who are you?
SPIKE: You'll find out on Saturday.
BUFFY: What happens on Saturday?
SPIKE: I kill you.
GILES: …that's what the other vampire called him? (Buffy nods) Sounds a little unorthodox.
BUFFY: Maybe he's reform.
GILES: (thumbing through diaries) He may have gone by a different name in times past…
JENNY: Whoever he is, we'll need all the help we can get come this Saturday.
XANDER: This Night of Saint Vigeous deal, if they're gonna attack in force  shouldn't we be thinkin': vacation?
WILLOW: We can't run, that would be wrong. Could we hide? I mean if that Spike Guy is leading the attack… (shudders loudly) …sorry, was that audible?
GILES: I'm sure he's no worse than any other creature you've faced -
BUFFY: Angel.
GILES: You know him?
ANGEL: Once he starts something he doesn't stop, until everything in his path is dead. Stay away.
XANDER: So he's thorough, goal oriented… okay, someone else lighten the mood.
BUFFY: We were at the Bronze before. I  thought you said you might show.
ANGEL: You said you weren't sure if you  were going.
BUFFY: I was being cool. You been dating for what, two hundred years, you don't know what a girl means when she says maybe she'll show? Work with me here.
WILLOW: Wow, two centuries of dating. If you only had two a year that'd still be like four hundred dates with four hundred different - (suddenly interested in weapons) -- why do they call it a mace?
GILES: Yes, well we've slightly more urgent things to discuss.
BUFFY: (turning away from Angel) Like keeping my mom away from Principal Snyder tomorrow night.
JENNY: And not dying Saturday.
GILES: Angel, do you know if this Spike fellow has any other names?
XANDER: That's it, I'm puttin' a collar with a little bell on that guy.
SHEILA: All right, which one is Dwayne and which one is Dell - don't tell me, Dell's the one with the tattoo!
SHEILA: You guys weren't lying about havin' a Cadillac, were ya'? Cause I'm crazy about a cad. Just the feel of the leather makes me wanna…
SHEILA: Hey, illustrated man, over here.
SPIKE: Who do you want me to be?
SHEILA: Did you see…?
SPIKE: Those two losers who thought they were good enough for you?
SHEILA: What happened to 'em?
SPIKE: They got sleepy.
SHEILA: Huh?
SPIKE: And you got something a whole lot better.
SHEILA: Hey, wait up. What's your name?
BOY: Saint Vigeous, you who murdered so many, we beseech you, cleans us of our weaknesses: mercy, compassion and pity.
OTHERS: We will bathe in their blood.
ONE: Where is he?
BOY: Spike? He, uh, said he doesn't go  for religion.
ONE: He should be here.
BOY: He's with the woman. He's always with the woman.
OTHERS: Bathe in their blood!
DRUSILLA: Miss Edith speaks out of turn. She's a bad example and will have no  cakes today.
SPIKE: Darling, are you gonna eat something?
DRUSILLA: I'm not hungry. I miss Prague.
SPIKE: You nearly died in Prague, Baby.  That idiot mob… this is the place  for us. The Hellmouth'll restore  you. Put color in your cheeks. Metaphorically speaking.
DRUSILLA: The stars will align, and smile down on me.
SPIKE: And then, God, this town will burn.
DRUSILLA: A pretty fire.
SPIKE: But baby, none of that's gonna happen unless you EAT.
DRUSILLA: They're preparing.
SPIKE: St. Vigeous is coming up. Should be a party. And I need a party. Man, I'm restless. Can't wait to ice that Slayer.
DRUSILLA: You should go up with them and cleanse…
SPIKE: Dru…
DRUSILLA: The boy doesn't trust you. They follow him. I sometimes think that my hair will fall out.
SPIKE: Never happen. Alright, I'll go get chanty with the fellahs. But you  have to do me one favor.
DRUSILLA: See, Miss Edith, if you'd been good, you could watch with the rest.
WILLOW: Do you think Sheila will show?
BUFFY: I doubt it. She doesn't seem to care about getting kicked out - about anything. I sort of envy that.
WILLOW: I don't think she's very happy.
XANDER: Anyone still remember when Saturday night meant date night?
CORDELIA: You sure don't.
BUFFY: (glances at clock) The parents start arriving in an hour. Okay, banners are in place, the lounge is comfy, what am I forgetting…?
WILLOW: Punch?
BUFFY: Punch! I need punch.
XANDER: The important thing in punch is the ratio of Vodka to Schnapps. (off looks) That was obviously far too sophisticated a joke for this crowd.
CORDELIA: My fingers are cramping, how long have I been doing this?
XANDER: Three minutes.
CORDELIA: So can I go now? She's not gonna need  that many stakes, I mean if this Spike guy's as mean as you all said, it should be over pretty fast. (to Buffy, off their looks) We're still rooting for you Saturday. I'd be there myself but I've got a leg wax.
BUFFY: You guys hold the fort. I'm punch bound.
WILLOW: What kind of punch did you make?
BUFFY: Lemonade.
WILLOW: How much sugar did you use?
BUFFY: (worried) Sugar?
WILLOW: (hardly able to speak) It's very good…
BUFFY: Now if we can just keep my mother  and Snyder from crossing paths for  the next three hours…
WILLOW: (sees Joyce arriving) Hi Mrs. Summers.
JOYCE: Hi Willow. (to Buffy) Hi honey. Did you do all this?
BUFFY: I did. How 'bout some lemonade -
WILLOW: Yeah, the library - no, because Giles and everyone…
BUFFY: (steering them down another hall) …are locked inside studying. French class it is.
SNYDER: Was that your mother?
BUFFY: Oh hi. Yeah, I wanted to introduce  you. She wouldn't have said too much,  she doesn't speak a word of English.
CORDELIA: Giles has us locked in that library working on your weapons. Even  slaves get minimum wage.
BUFFY: What?
CORDELIA: You're starting to look pretty slagged.  What are you, just skipping foundation  entirely now?
BUFFY: Cordelia, I have at least three lives to contend with and none of them really mesh. It's like oil and water and… a third unmeshable thing.
CORDELIA: Yeah. And I can see the oil. (re: Willow and Joyce approaching) Is that your mom? Now that's a woman who knows how to moisturize. Did it  like skip a generation?
JOYCE: Well I believe I've seen every  classroom on campus. And in each  one your teachers had miraculously  just stepped out.
BUFFY: But you didn't see the boiler room. And that's really interesting because of the boiler being right there in the room and all -
JOYCE: Hello. I'm Joyce Summers, Buffy's mother.
SNYDER: Principal Snyder. I'm afraid we need to talk. My office is down here.
CORDELIA: When they're done talking…
BUFFY: What?
CORDELIA: My guess? Tenth high school reunion? You'll still be grounded.
WILLOW: Cordelia… have some punch.
GILES: Well, there you are…
JENNY: There who is?
GILES: (re: diaries) Our new friend Spike. "Known as  William the Bloody, earned his nickname  by torturning his victims with railroad  spikes…" Ahh, but here's some good  news, he's barely two hundred, not even  as old as Angel… oh…
XANDER: That's a bad look, right?
GILES: I think your suggestion of running away this Saturday may have been a good one. Spike has fought two Slayers in the last century. And killed them both.
JOYCE: In the car. Now.
SPIKE: What can I say? I couldn't wait.
BUFFY: Run!
SPIKE: No one gets out! Especially the girl!
BUFFY: It's Spike and a small army! Look out!
BUFFY: Barricade -
GILES: -- the door!
SNYDER: Oh my god!
BOY: We cut the power, nobody got out.
SPIKE: And the Slayer?
BOY: She either went that way…
SPIKE: (tightens death grip on parent's neck) You don't know?
GILES: They cut the phones. (to Xander) There's an old boarded cellar behind the stacks. You can get out that way. Find Angel. He knows about Spike, we need him.
XANDER: I'm not going anywhere until I know Buffy and Willow are all right.
GILES: No one's going to be all right if we don't get some help.
PARENT: Who are these people, what do they want?
JOYCE: I didn't get much of a look but, is there  something wrong with their faces?
SNYDER: Yes! (Buffy looks over) P.C.P. It's a gang on P.C.P.! We've got to get out of here.
BUFFY: You can't go outside. They'll kill you.
SNYDER: YOU DON'T TELL ME, I TELL YOU!
BUFFY: They will kill everyone in this room. Nobody goes out. Nobody comes in. Until I say so. Do you read me?
SNYDER: Who do you think you are?
BUFFY: I'm the one who knows how to stop them.
JOYCE: Buffy are you crazy? I know  you've been… (re: Snyder) …accused of fighting and other  things but those guys are serious…  you can't go out there.
BUFFY: I know. That's why I'm going up there.
SPIKE: Slayer… here kitty, kitty…
SPIKE: …and use their bones to bash your head in.
CORDELIA: Oh god, oh god, oh god -
BOY: Spike!
BOY: Listen.
SPIKE: Someone's in the ceiling.
JENNY: What are you doing? There's at least three vampires in that hall and god knows how many others in the building.
GILES: I'm the Watcher, I'm responsible for  her, I have to go.
JENNY: Be careful.
GILES: Push them back the minute I'm -
JENNY: How are the others?
BUFFY: Snyder, my mom, and four others are locked in the science room across the hall. Cordelia and Willow ran the other way, I don't know if they're… where's Xander?
GILES: He got out through the stacks. He's getting Angel.
BUFFY: Good. After I take out the vamps in the hall you two can get my mom  and the others out that way, too.
GILES: I should go with you and fight.
BUFFY: Giles, my mother is in that classroom. If I don't make it, I know you'll make sure she does.
GILES: Bloody well right I will. What's your plan?
BUFFY: They split up to hold us here. So I  can take 'em one on one. Set 'em up, knock 'em down.
GILES: Watch your back…
JOYCE: Why don't you sit down…
SNYDER: This is my school. What I say goes. And I say this isn't happening.
JOYCE: Well then I guess the danger is over.
PARENT: I'm not waiting for them to break down the doors. I'm getting out.
JOYCE: Don't be an idiot!
SNYDER: I'm beginning to see a certain mother- daughter resemblance.
JOYCE: Oh yeah.
SNYDER: She's a student, what does she know?
SPIKE: Use your head…
SNYDER: I did it!
PARENT: He's got me! Help! Help!
XANDER: You know about this Spike guy so, uh, you got a plan?
CORDELIA: I think he's gone.
WILLOW: He could come back.
CORDELIA: What are we gonna do?
WILLOW: Pray.
JOYCE: Buffy! Are you okay?
BUFFY: (sotto voice) I'm fine, Mom.
JOYCE: Buffy, get out of here! We'll be  okay.
BUFFY: Just hang on for one more minute, till I tell you to open the door.
SHEILA: Sorry I'm late. There's some pretty weird guys outside…
BUFFY: They're trying to kill us.
SHEILA: (picks up fire ax) This should be fun.
SPIKE: Angelus. I'll be damned.
ANGEL: I taught you to always guard your perimeter. (re: door he entered) You should have someone out there.
SPIKE: I did. I'm surrounded by idiots. What's new with you?
ANGEL: Everything.
SPIKE: Come up against this Slayer yet?
ANGEL: She's cute. Not too bright, though. Gave the puppy dog, I'm-all-tortured  act. Keeps her off my back when I  feed.
SPIKE: People still fall for that Anne Rice routine? What a world.
XANDER: I knew you were a lying… undead liar guy.
ANGEL: Want a bite before we kill her?
BUFFY: Stay behind me.
GILES: Buffy! Look out -
BUFFY: Mom! Now!
JOYCE: You're coming, too.
BUFFY: In a minute. Go!
GILES: Right through the back…
SPIKE: Haven't seen you in the killing fields  for an age.
ANGEL: I'm not much for company.
SPIKE: No, you never were. So why are you so scared of this Slayer?
ANGEL: Scared?
SPIKE: Time was, you'd've taken her out in a heartbeat. Now look at you. This tortured thing is an act, right? You're not housebroken?
ANGEL: I saw her kill the Master. Hey, you think you can take her alone, be my guest. (re: Xander) I'll just feed and run.
SPIKE: Don't be silly. We're old friends. We'll do it together. Let's drink to it.
XANDER: No!
SPIKE: You think you can fool me? You were my sire, man… you were my Yoda!
ANGEL: Things change.
SPIKE: Not us! Not demons. Man, I can't believe this - you Uncle Tom!
BUFFY: Do we really need weapons for this?
SPIKE: I just like 'em. Make me feel all  manly.
BUFFY: You shouldn't have come here.
SPIKE: Yeah, I messed up your doilies and  stuff. But I just got so bored! Tell you  what. As a personal favor from me to  you. I'll make it quick. It won't hurt a bit.
BUFFY: Wrong. It's gonna hurt a lot.
SPIKE: Now that hurt.
JOYCE: You get the hell away from my daughter!
SPIKE: (bitterly) Women.
BUFFY: Mom… you…
JOYCE: No one… lays a finger… on  my little girl.
SNYDER: Hello Bob.
CHIEF: It's over. They all got away.
SNYDER: I told him not to go out that window.
CHIEF: I'm going to have to say something  to the media.
SNYDER: So?
CHIEF: So… usual story, gang-related, P.C.P.?
SNYDER: What did you have in mind, the truth?
CHIEF: Right. Gang related. PCP.
XANDER: So when you were giving him my neck to chew on, how come you didn't clock him before he clocked you?
ANGEL: I told you, I couldn't make the first move. I had to see if he was buying it or not.
XANDER: And if he bit me, then what?
ANGEL: (can't resist) We would have known he bought it.
XANDER: And what was that about you bein' Spike's sire? What's a sire? (rubs his aching neck) God, I could sleep for a month.
BUFFY: So, uh… what did you and principal Snyder talk about anyway?
JOYCE: Principal Snyder told me you were a troublemaker. And I could care less. (turns to her) I have a daughter who can take care  of herself. Who's brave and resourceful and thinks of others when there's a  crisis. No matter who you hang out  with or what dumb teenage stuff you  think you have to do, I'm gonna sleep  better knowing all that.
BUFFY: About how long till this wears off and you start ragging me again?
JOYCE: At LEAST a week and a half.
BUFFY: That is so cool…
CORDELIA: …and if you get me out of this I swear I'll never be mean to anyone ever again… you know, unless they really deserve it…
WILLOW: Ask for some aspirin.
DRUSILLA: Did she hurt you?
SPIKE: I was close, baby, but…
DRUSILLA: Come here.
SPIKE: A Slayer with family and friends.  That sure as hell wasn't in the brochure.
DRUSILLA: You'll kill her. And then we'll have a nice party.
SPIKE: Yeah, a party.
DRUSILLA: With streamers, and songs.
SPIKE: How's the Annoying One?
DRUSILLA: He doesn't want to play.
SPIKE: Figures. Suppose I better go make nice.
ONE: You failed.
SPIKE: Yeah, I, uh… I offer penance…
BOY: Penance? You should lay down your life! Our numbers are depleted. The  Feast of St. Vigeous has been ruined  by your impatience.
ONE: Should I forgive you?
SPIKE: It was… rash… and if I had to do it  all over again… ah who am I kidding?  I'd do it exactly the same, only I'd do  THIS first.
SPIKE: Let's see what's on TV.
