It does appear to be mocking you with its eye-holes.
But anyway I thought we were doing the Alpha Delt thing.
Yeah…
Didn't we tell you?
You can come.
You want me to come with?
She didn't even touch her pumpkin. (eyeing it, disturbed) It's a freak with no face.
I've got the basics down: levitation, charms, glamours… I just feel like I've plateaued, wicca-wise.
Transmutation, <u>conjuring</u>… Bringing forth something  from nothing… It gets you pretty close to the primal  forces. A little scary…
"Don't do it?" What kind of encouragement is that?
I don't know. Then again, what's college for if not  experimenting? Maybe I can handle it. I'll know when I've reached my limit.
Where's supportive boyfriend guy?
Okay, Brutus. (beat) Brutus. Caesar, betrayal, trusted friend, backstabby…
I know. I kinda like him worrying anyway…
Buffy, don't let jerky Parker chase you away…
Know what? You're gonna feel better after the  party tonight. Maybe you'll even meet someone.
Tonight? But, it's Halloween.
No, I'll meet you at your place… Yeah, Buffy said she was coming but I haven't seen her. We have to make sure she has fun. We have to force fun upon her… yeah, and if Parker shows up, we'll just, you know, axe murder him! That's halloweeny. 'Kay. See you in a bit.
Oh, the lord told me to lead the French army in battle or I would…I love your outfit though.
I'm Joan of Arc. I figured we had a lot in common,  seeing as how I was almost burned at the stake. Plus  she had that close relationship with God.
What were they supposed to be?
Buffy, you're not a third-wheel.
We're gonna have the best time.
Fnyew! Cobweb.
That part was realistic.
We'll all back you up on that story, Xander. Even if they question us separately -
Is it gone? Are there more? Is it off?
Okay, that is NOT sanitary.
Yeah. (as they go) Are you sure they're off me?
No. I hear it, too. Something else. Something like…
Oz, don't. It might be-
Where's the door?
Hey, I have a neat idea. Let's get out of here.
I'm serious, Buffy. We don't know what  we're dealing with.
Buffy!
You're telling us to run away? And leave you behind?
<i>Telling </i>me? You're TELLING me?-
It's not your decision-
Of course, you do-
(not hearing him) Being the Slayer doesn't automatically make you boss. You're as lost as the rest of us-
It's a simple incantation. A guiding spell. For travelers when they become lost or disoriented.
It conjures an emissary from the beyond that… lights the way.
Oh, yeah? Well, so's your face.
I'm not your sidekick.
She thinks I'm not ready to be a full blown witch. I can control dark forces just as good as anyone. It's not that hard, a guiding spell… I'm careful and all…
Stairs! Look, we found stairs.
Buffy didn't find the stairs. No sir.
Okay, we should go up to the Goat room and see if -
(hopefully) Something… good?
Oh. Not good.
B-but, you can't be. There's no moon tonight.
No. We need to just find something to restrain you… A rope or some kind of chain…
Or… or… I can do the guiding spell. I know I can make it work.
We can get out of here and… and find Giles. He can help-
Oz! Oz!!! Don't leave me!
(calling out) Oz!
Oh God… Okay, guiding spell. Okay. Yeah. I can do it.
Aradia, goddess of the lost. The path is murky. The woods are dense. Darkness pervades. I beseech thee… Bring the light.
Whoa. Hey. I did it. (to firefly) I did you. Hi.
Right. You're waiting for instructions. Lead me to Oz.
(reconsidering) Wait. I should try to find those people  trapped upstairs first.
(still contemplating) Even if I get them, we still need to find a way out of the house. (turning back to fly) Okay, here's what I think we-
Hey. What's going…
Stop!
Stop it! Get off! (screaming now) Oz!!! Hel-
Get them off me! Get them off!!!
(hysterical) C-couldn't… get them… off. F-f-fireflies. T-too many! And they flew… in my mouth… And my eyes… and I… couldn't breath and…
But we… we got away.
I think this is Gaelic.
Okay. Um um um, the icon's called the Mark of Gachnar. I think this is a summoning spell for something called…
Yes! Somehow the beginning of the spell was accidentally  triggered. Gachnar's trying to manifest itself. To come into being.
It feeds on… fear.
(turning) Look!
He's so cute.
I think I'm gonna barf.
