Your Uncle Roary let me in. Does he always smell like peppermint?
You haven't called. Not once.
And you just accepted that? I only said what I thought you wanted to hear.
That's stupid.
(smiling) Really? (off his nod) I thought we could go out tonight for our anniversary.
It's been exactly one week since we copulated. (her eyes narrow) Did you forget?
I don't understand.
No, I understand that inane ritual. It's those people -  you continue to associate with them though you  share little in common.
I mean, they go to college, you don't. They no longer live at home, you do…
Okay, okay. Don't get upset with me. I just wondered.
You mean, like, a date? Is that what this is? Are we dating?
A costume?
Scary. Scary how?
Hey! Hello!
Xander.
Xander's in trouble! You've got to do something! Right now!
Are you listening? Xander's trapped!
(casually) Oh. They're trapped too. (with import) But we've got to save Xander.
We were supposed to meet at this house. I get there, but there's no door where a door should be. Then I see a girl in a window. Then - pffft - she's gone.
Window vanished from the house.
What?
Well…?
Create a door. You can do that?
Xander.
What?
Bunnies frighten me.
