XANDER: I dunno, I was going for ferocious scary,  but it's coming out more dryly sardonic.
WILLOW: It does appear to be mocking you with its eye-holes.
OZ: Yet its nose-hole seems sad and full of self-loathing.
XANDER: What do you think, Buff?
BUFFY: Just thinking about the life of a pumpkin. Grow up in the sun,  happily entwined with others… Then somebody comes along,  cuts you open and rips your guts out.
XANDER: O-kay. And on that happy note… Got a treat for tomorrow night's second annual Halloween screening, people: (grabs video box) Prepare to have your spines tingled  and your gooses bumped by the terrifying… (reading box spine) "<u>Fantasia</u>?!"
OZ: You know, maybe it's 'cause of all the horrific things we've seen, but hippos wearing tutus just don't  unnerve me like they used to.
XANDER: <u>Phantasm</u>! This was supposed to be <u>Phantasm</u>. Stupid video store.
WILLOW: But anyway I thought we were doing the Alpha Delt thing.
XANDER: What thing?
BUFFY: The scary house? It sounds a little lame.
OZ: It actually borders on fun. You have to go through the whole scary house maze to get to the party and it's usually worth getting to. Those guys go all out.
BUFFY: As witnessed last Friday.
WILLOW: Yeah…
XANDER: Yeah? What? There's a party?
WILLOW: Didn't we tell you?
XANDER: (defensive) It's cool. You guys have a little college thing. Hey, fine by me. I got better things to do than tag along to some fraternity-
WILLOW: You can come.
XANDER: 'kay.  (qualifying) But only because I lied about having better things to do.
BUFFY: I'm gonna get going.
XANDER: Now? The night's… (checks his watch) Okay, a little mature, but still…
BUFFY: I'm sleepy. But you guys have fun.
WILLOW: You want me to come with?
BUFFY: (shaking her head) I'm cool.
XANDER: Sad Buffy.
WILLOW: She didn't even touch her pumpkin. (eyeing it, disturbed) It's a freak with no face.
OZ: Our girl's still suffering from a little post-Parker depression.
XANDER: Bailing on the Buff. Does anyone else wanna smack that guy?
DEMON: Ow! Geez, that hurts!
BOY: What the hell is wrong with you?
BUFFY: (under her breath) That's what I'd like to know.
WILLOW: I've got the basics down: levitation, charms, glamours… I just feel like I've plateaued, wicca-wise.
BUFFY: What's the next level?
WILLOW: Transmutation, <u>conjuring</u>… Bringing forth something  from nothing… It gets you pretty close to the primal  forces. A little scary…
BUFFY: Nobody's pushing, Will. If it's too much, don't do it.
WILLOW: "Don't do it?" What kind of encouragement is that?
BUFFY: This an "encourage me" talk? I thought it was a "share my pain."
WILLOW: I don't know. Then again, what's college for if not  experimenting? Maybe I can handle it. I'll know when I've reached my limit.
OZ: Wine coolers?
BUFFY: Magic.
OZ: Oh. Didn't encourage her, did you?
WILLOW: Where's supportive boyfriend guy?
OZ: Picking up your dry-cleaning. But he told me to tell you he's afraid you're going to get hurt.
WILLOW: Okay, Brutus. (beat) Brutus. Caesar, betrayal, trusted friend, backstabby…
OZ: No, I'm with you on the reference, but I'm not gonna lie about the fact that I worry. I know what it's like to have power you can't control. Every time I start to wolf out I touch something deep dark… it's not fun. But whatever you decide, you know I'll back your play.
BUFFY: See? Concerned boy is sweet boy.
WILLOW: I know. I kinda like him worrying anyway…
BUFFY: You know, I'm… I forgot to… be hungry…
WILLOW: Buffy, don't let jerky Parker chase you away…
BUFFY: He didn't. Just don't want to deal right now. Taking  a little holiday from dealing, happily vacationing  in the land of not coping.
WILLOW: Know what? You're gonna feel better after the  party tonight. Maybe you'll even meet someone.
BUFFY: Willow, I don't want to meet someone. I've reached my quota on someones. Anyway, I think I should probably patrol.
WILLOW: Tonight? But, it's Halloween.
BUFFY: I'll double-check with Giles, but I'm pretty sure he'll want me on active Slayer duty. He doesn't really care about the whole  "Halloween" thing.
GILES: Happy Hal-lo, Buffy.
BUFFY: (mortified) Oh. My. God.
GILES: It's a sombrero.
BUFFY: And it's on your head.
GILES: It seemed festive. Come in.
GILES: Candy?
BUFFY: Giles, what is going on here? You hate Halloween.
GILES: I've never said any such thing. As my watcher duties took  precedence, I simply hadn't taken the time to embrace its  inherent charms. Until now. Look!
GILES: It's alive!
GILES: Heh heh… see how he… shakes… (turns it off) Right, is there something you wanted?
BUFFY: Thinking I should patrol tonight. Maybe stake out the cemetery, or some of the more inviting- (re: his hat) Could you please take that off?
GILES: I see. Is there some specific danger you're sensing?
BUFFY: No. But then we were caught off guard when your pal Ethan  turned everyone into their costumes.
GILES: True. But what happened then was anomalous. Creatures of the  night shy away from Halloween. They find it all much too crass.
BUFFY: (re: decorations) Hard to believe.
GILES: I promise you, there's little chance of any supernatural activity tonight.
EDWARD: I come bearing spiders.
JOSH: The sound system's not gonna cut it. It's nothing but lame.
EDWARD: You want me to call Oz? He can probably hook us up.
JOSH: Do it. If we cannot scare the young women, they will not fall  into our arms. We'll have womanless arms. Halloween is not about thrills and chills and funny costumes. It's about getting laid.
EDWARD: Is there any holiday that's not about getting laid?
JOSH: (without hesitation) Arbor day. Call Oz.
EDWARD: Done. And, oh - hey. You wanted a symbol to paint upstairs? Something mystical? (opens book to large depiction of the Symbol of Gachnar) Check this out.
XANDER: (catching his breath) Anya. You really gotta get this knocking thing down. How did you-?
ANYA: Your Uncle Roary let me in. Does he always smell like peppermint?
XANDER: The man likes his schnapps. What are you doing here?
ANYA: You haven't called. Not once.
XANDER: You said you were over me.
ANYA: And you just accepted that? I only said what I thought you wanted to hear.
XANDER: Well, that's the funny thing about me: I tend to hear the actual words people say and accept them at face value.
ANYA: That's stupid.
XANDER: I accept that. (with some affection) I can't say seeing you falls into the realm of a bad thing.
ANYA: (smiling) Really? (off his nod) I thought we could go out tonight for our anniversary.
XANDER: Anniversary.
ANYA: It's been exactly one week since we copulated. (her eyes narrow) Did you forget?
XANDER: No! Of course not. It's just that I already have plans  with Buffy, Willow and Oz. It's Halloween, you know.
ANYA: I don't understand.
XANDER: Well, every October 31st, we mortals dress up in masks and-
ANYA: No, I understand that inane ritual. It's those people -  you continue to associate with them though you  share little in common.
XANDER: (becoming agitated) What are you talking about?
ANYA: I mean, they go to college, you don't. They no longer live at home, you do…
XANDER: (defensive) Hey, those things… The bonds of true friendship transcend any… (trailing off) Could we just change the subject?
ANYA: Okay, okay. Don't get upset with me. I just wondered.
XANDER: If you want, you can come with me tonight to this party. You could observe healthy human relationships and catch a rare glimpse of the ever elusive frat guy throwing up on himself.
ANYA: You mean, like, a date? Is that what this is? Are we dating?
XANDER: There are definitely date-like qualities at work here.
XANDER: You'll need a costume.
ANYA: A costume?
XANDER: Dress up. You know, something scary.
ANYA: Scary. Scary how?
XANDER: Anya, you - ex-demon - terrorized mankind for  centuries. I'm sure you'll come up with something.
BUFFY: Excuse me, Professor Walsh…
BUFFY: I came to pick up today's assignment. I wasn't able to get to class because of some personal-
WALSH: Right. (looks her over) I count four limbs, a head, no visible scarring so I assume your personal issue was not a life threatening accident of any kind and am therefore uninterested. You got problems, solve them on your own time.
WALSH: Miss another class and you're out.
RILEY: She means it, you know.
BUFFY: Yeah, I got the impression she wasn't saying it to make me laugh.
RILEY: You've got to be aware your work's taken a little downturn lately. I can't remember the last time I saw your hand up.
BUFFY: (joking weakly) Does stretching count?
RILEY: Things get pretty intense freshman year, as I dimly recall. Too much fun? Or not enough.
BUFFY: Both, actually.
RILEY: Well, you just gotta keep your priorities. Professor Walsh is worth your time.
BUFFY: I'll do this stuff tonight.
RILEY: It's Halloween. You're not gonna dress up and party?
BUFFY: I just have a lot of -
RILEY: Look, I may be out of line here; it's not my business,  but you seem like the kind of person who makes things  hard on themselves. Halloween ain't a night for responsibility.  It's when the ghosts and goblins come out.
BUFFY: That's actually a misnomer -
RILEY: Well, I didn't mean real ones. But there's some good scary fun to be had on campus tonight.
BUFFY: What are you doing?
RILEY: I'm gonna sit here and grade papers.
BUFFY: Scary.
RILEY: Very.
BUFFY: Well, thanks for the pep talk… coach.
RILEY: Don't make fun. I worked long and hard to get this pompous.
BUFFY: No. I mean it.
RILEY: Welcome.
CHAZ: Watch where you're walking, guys. Paint's still wet in spots.
JOSH: Thanks for the loan, man. Our sound system sucks.
OZ: Mi Casio es su Casio.
XANDER: Interesting little design. What's it mean?
CHAZ: No clue. Got it from that book. (indicates a tome nearby) Lotta cool stuff in there about - 
XANDER: (noticing) Oo, grapes!
XANDER: Wow. Peeled. You guys know how to spoil your guests.
JOSH: Eyeballs, man. You blindfold chicks, have 'em put their hands in the bowl, then tell 'em it's eyeballs. They love that.
XANDER: And here I was wasting time buying 'em flowers  and complimenting them on their shoes. (looking around) So you go through the whole house of horrors downstairs and end up here. Sweet. You fratly guys have a nice set up.
JOSH: Hey, mighty mighty Alpha Delts. You should think about pledging.
OZ: Xander's a civilian.
JOSH: (pitying) Ohh. Townie, huh? Didn't know. He looked so normal. (funnin') Sure we should let him come to the party, Oz?
XANDER: Hey, standing right here!
JOSH: (appreciatively) Crankin'.
XANDER: Sensing a disturbance in the Force, Master?
OZ: Left speaker's sputtering a little.
XANDER: And you think stabbing it is the proper response.
OZ: I'm trimming the wire. There  might be a short- (sharply) Ah!
XANDER: Oz?
OZ: Cut myself. It's okay.
CHAZ: Oz, you bleed to death, I got dibs on your equipment.
BUFFY: Thanks again for doing this at the last minute.
JOYCE: I'm just glad I could find it.
JOYCE: Try it now. I let down the hem and loosened it a little around the neck.
BUFFY: Better.
BUFFY: Somebody's getting nostalgic face.
JOYCE: I'm sorry. You look just like that little girl who wore this, what is it, five, six years ago.
BUFFY: When Little Red Riding Hood was the cutting edge in costumes.
JOYCE: Your father used to love taking you out.
BUFFY: Oh, he was such a pain! Twelve years old and I can't go trick-or-treating by myself.
JOYCE: He wanted to keep you safe.
BUFFY: Nuh-uh, he wanted the candy. I was only the beard.
JOYCE: Not true. The candy was for me. Your father loved spending time with you.
BUFFY: Not enough, I guess.
JOYCE: Buffy…
BUFFY: Boy, that just paved over Memory Lane, didn't it?
JOYCE: You know the divorce had nothing to do with you.
BUFFY: I don't know… I just kinda feel like there's a pattern here. Open your heart to someone and he… he bails on you.  Maybe it would be easier to just not let anyone in anymore.
JOYCE: I thought it would be easier. (off her look) You must have noticed I'm not the social butterfly I was when I was with your father. I don't think I made one friend the year we moved to Sunnydale.
BUFFY: Why was that?
JOYCE: Fear. I didn't believe I could trust anyone again. It's taken time and a lot of effort, but I've got a nice circle of friends now. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a little gun shy. (an aside) Certainly didn't help that my last boyfriend turned out to be a homicidal robot.
JOYCE: But I'll always be here for you. And you have Mr. Giles. And your friends. You'll see. There's nothing to be afraid of.
WILLOW: No, I'll meet you at your place… Yeah, Buffy said she was coming but I haven't seen her. We have to make sure she has fun. We have to force fun upon her… yeah, and if Parker shows up, we'll just, you know, axe murder him! That's halloweeny. 'Kay. See you in a bit.
HALLMATE: Willow! You gotta stop by the room.
WILLOW: Oh, the lord told me to lead the French army in battle or I would…I love your outfit though.
GIRL: (crying) I know you were flirting with her!
BOY: Do we have to do this every time? I love you, you know that…
JOSH: Okay, Rach. What's in the next one?
RACHEL: You guys are sick. This is so gross!!
JOSH: Here. Give me your hand.
JOSH: They're eyeballs, Rachel! Eyeballs! Ahhahaha!
XANDER: (quite the wolf) Whatchya got in that basket, little girl?
BUFFY: Weapons.
XANDER: Oh.
BUFFY: Just in case. Like the tux, Xander.
XANDER: (correcting her) Bond. James Bond. Insurance, you know - in case we all turn into our costumes again, I'm going for cool secret agent guy.
BUFFY: Hate to break it to you, but you'll probably end up cool head waiter guy.
XANDER: As long as I'm cool and I wield some kind of power.
BUFFY: Will… Medieval Will.
XANDER: Hail, ye olde…varletty… thou.
WILLOW: I'm Joan of Arc. I figured we had a lot in common,  seeing as how I was almost burned at the stake. Plus  she had that close relationship with God.
XANDER: (to Oz) And you are… ?
XANDER: Of course.
XANDER: Wish I'd thought of that before I put my deposit down. I could've been God.
OZ: Blasphemer.
BUFFY: Like your outfits. Very stealthy.
WILLOW: What were they supposed to be?
OZ: (shrugging) NATO?
XANDER: Oh, yeah. I invited Anya to join us, but she's having some trouble finding a scary costume, so she's going to meet us there.
BUFFY: Perfect. Everybody's got a date but third-wheel Buffy.
WILLOW: Buffy, you're not a third-wheel.
XANDER: Technically speaking, you're a fifth wheel.
WILLOW: We're gonna have the best time.
VOICE: REELEEASE MEEE!
JOSH: Help me!! Oh God, help m-
OZ: Let the horrors begin…
BUFFY: Cute.
XANDER: The joint's not jumpin'. Where is everybody?
OZ: Follow the signs.
BUFFY: Terrifying. If I were Abbott and Costello, this would be fairly traumatic.
WILLOW: Fnyew! Cobweb.
WILLOW: That part was realistic.
OZ: Well, frat boys not obsessive with the cleaning.  That might not be decoration per se.
XANDER: I wasn't scared. I was in the spirit.
WILLOW: We'll all back you up on that story, Xander. Even if they question us separately -
WILLOW: Is it gone? Are there more? Is it off?
OZ: It's gone.
BUFFY: You're clean.
WILLOW: Okay, that is NOT sanitary.
BUFFY: Why don't we get to the party part of the party.
WILLOW: Yeah. (as they go) Are you sure they're off me?
OZ: I thought this led…
XANDER: What is it?
BUFFY: Blood. (sniffs it) Real blood.
XANDER: Okay, actual creeps have been given. Bravo frat boys -
BUFFY: (listening) Shh. Do you hear that? Sounds like "squeaking."
XANDER: It's these rented shoes. Patent leather. I asked the guy to break them in for me-
WILLOW: No. I hear it, too. Something else. Something like…
WILLOW: Oz, don't. It might be-
BUFFY: What the hell's going on?
XANDER: Look, maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's just a neat trick. Something done with wires or-
XANDER: Or it might be something else.
ANYA: Hey! Hello!
RACHEL: Help me! Somebody please help m-
ANYA: Xander.
XANDER: Where's the stairs?
WILLOW: Where's the door?
BUFFY: This is the way we came in, right? We just went in a circle.
BUFFY: Thank the Lord.
OZ: You're welcome.
WILLOW: Hey, I have a neat idea. Let's get out of here.
BUFFY: And you were so anxious for me to come.
WILLOW: I'm serious, Buffy. We don't know what  we're dealing with.
XANDER: (listening) My turn, did anyone hear that?
BUFFY: Well, once I start dealing with it, I'll get a good idea what it is I'm dealing… (cocks an ear) Do you hear something?
XANDER: Like I said.
XANDER: Sounds like a hissing.
BUFFY: It's like a "sss" noise. 
XANDER: (a little annoyed) Thought the word "hissing" kinda covered that nicely.
CHAZ: … I'm s-sorry, I d-didn't know… didn't know, I'm s-so sorry…
OZ: Chaz. What's happening?
CHAZ: It…
BUFFY: What is it?
CHAZ: It's alive…
BUFFY: Chaz, what's alive? What happened here?
XANDER: He's in shock.
BUFFY: All right, we get him out of here.
BUFFY: AAHHGH!
WILLOW: Buffy!
XANDER: Let me see.
BUFFY: I think the cape got most of it.
OZ: Cowering in the closet is starting to seem like a reasonable plan.
BUFFY: What closet?
BUFFY: I'm gonna find my way upstairs, see if there's people there. You guys find a way out of the house and use it.
WILLOW: You're telling us to run away? And leave you behind?
BUFFY: We need help. We need the only person who can make sense of what's happening.
GILES: (mouth full) Jush mo-munt… Comeng…
GILES: Happy Ha-
ANYA: Xander's in trouble! You've got to do something! Right now!
GILES: Anya?
ANYA: Are you listening? Xander's trapped!
GILES: Where are Buffy and the others?
ANYA: (casually) Oh. They're trapped too. (with import) But we've got to save Xander.
GILES: Slow down. I need you to be more specific.
ANYA: We were supposed to meet at this house. I get there, but there's no door where a door should be. Then I see a girl in a window. Then - pffft - she's gone.
GILES: She vanished from the window?
ANYA: Window vanished from the house.
GILES: (thinking, to himself) Hmm. Reality and matter distortion… Like a summoning spell's temporal flux.
ANYA: What?
GILES: Nevermind. Let me get my supplies.
GILES: I shouldn't worry too much about Xander.  At least he's among friends.
BUFFY: Will, I'm telling you-
WILLOW: <i>Telling </i>me? You're TELLING me?-
BUFFY: I can't do my job if I'm worrying about each of your safety-
WILLOW: It's not your decision-
BUFFY: Gotta disagree with you there-
WILLOW: Of course, you do-
XANDER: Let's all take a breath. Buffy, maybe we-
WILLOW: (not hearing him) Being the Slayer doesn't automatically make you boss. You're as lost as the rest of us-
OZ: (to Willow) So what are we talking about?
WILLOW: It's a simple incantation. A guiding spell. For travelers when they become lost or disoriented.
BUFFY: And how's it work?
WILLOW: It conjures an emissary from the beyond that… lights the way.
BUFFY: Conjuring? Let's be honest, Will, your basic spells are usually  about fifty-fifty.
WILLOW: Oh, yeah? Well, so's your face.
BUFFY: What? What does that mean?
WILLOW: I'm not your sidekick.
OZ: Will, hang on.
XANDER: Well, that was a bunch of laughs. Look, Buff, we're all tired and a little on edge. Maybe Willow's overreacting. I'm sure part of it's 'cause of how you've been pushing- away girl lately. But now's not the time to let that stuff tear us apart.
XANDER: What I'm saying is, I'm still with you. Right by your side, all the-
BUFFY: (eyes darting around) Xander?!
XANDER: Funny. Nice to see you haven't lost your sense of inappropriate humor.
BUFFY: (calling) Xander! Where are you?
XANDER: Okay, cut it out, Buffy! Skit over. I'm right here. (growing worried) Here! (yelling) BUFFY!
BUFFY: This is so typical of him.
XANDER: Typical?
BUFFY: (calling) Xander?
XANDER: Buff--?
WILLOW: She thinks I'm not ready to be a full blown witch. I can control dark forces just as good as anyone. It's not that hard, a guiding spell… I'm careful and all…
OZ: This floor used to have windows…
WILLOW: Stairs! Look, we found stairs.
WILLOW: Buffy didn't find the stairs. No sir.
OZ: I don't think you guys are thinking clearly…
WILLOW: Okay, we should go up to the Goat room and see if -
OZ: Will.
OZ: Something's happening.
WILLOW: (hopefully) Something… good?
WILLOW: Oh. Not good.
OZ: I'm changing.
WILLOW: B-but, you can't be. There's no moon tonight.
OZ: I have to get away.
WILLOW: No. We need to just find something to restrain you… A rope or some kind of chain…
OZ: No time.
WILLOW: Or… or… I can do the guiding spell. I know I can make it work.
OZ: Will, please…
WILLOW: We can get out of here and… and find Giles. He can help-
OZ: (snapping) No!
WILLOW: Oz! Oz!!! Don't leave me!
XANDER: Will!
XANDER: We got trouble. There's something terribly wrong with Buffy. She can't even tell that I'm -
WILLOW: (calling out) Oz!
WILLOW: Oh God… Okay, guiding spell. Okay. Yeah. I can do it.
XANDER: There I am. Didn't go anywhere. Great. Just have to live with the fact that no one else can see me!
HEAD: I can see you.
OZ: Not gonna change, not gonna change, not gonna change…
WILLOW: Aradia, goddess of the lost. The path is murky. The woods are dense. Darkness pervades. I beseech thee… Bring the light.
WILLOW: Whoa. Hey. I did it. (to firefly) I did you. Hi.
WILLOW: Right. You're waiting for instructions. Lead me to Oz.
WILLOW: (reconsidering) Wait. I should try to find those people  trapped upstairs first.
WILLOW: (still contemplating) Even if I get them, we still need to find a way out of the house. (turning back to fly) Okay, here's what I think we-
WILLOW: Hey. What's going…
WILLOW: Stop!
WILLOW: Stop it! Get off! (screaming now) Oz!!! Hel-
BUFFY: Willow?!
BUFFY: (dawning realization) Basement. I'm in the basement.
VOICE: All alone.
BUFFY: Who's there?
JOSH: They all ran away from you. They always will.  Open your heart to someone and…
JOSH: But don't fret, little girl. You're not alone…
JOSH: … anymore.
ANYA: Well…?
GILES: We're going to have to create a door.
ANYA: Create a door. You can do that?
GILES: I can.
GILES: You may want to step back.
JOSH: I don't see why you bother.
BUFFY: (to herself) The Goat Room.
BUFFY: Oz?
WILLOW: Get them off me! Get them off!!!
WILLOW: (hysterical) C-couldn't… get them… off. F-f-fireflies. T-too many! And they flew… in my mouth… And my eyes… and I… couldn't breath and…
OZ: It's okay. We're okay.
BUFFY: We're not okay. We have to get out of here.
XANDER: I'd offer my opinion, but you jerks aren't going to hear it anyway. Not that "didn't go to college boy" is worth  listening to, might as well just hang out with my new best friend, "Bleeding Dummy Head" for all you dorks care.
BUFFY: What is wrong with you?
XANDER: (shocked) Y-you heard that? You can see me? (shakily) Good. Oh God, that's good.
OZ: The house separated us. It wanted to scare us.
WILLOW: But we… we got away.
BUFFY: No, it brought us here. We got so scared we ended up… here. Why here?
XANDER: I saw them painting it. They were copying it out of… (scanning the room) That.
WILLOW: I think this is Gaelic.
BUFFY: Can you translate?
VOICE: REEELEEEASE MEEE!!!
BUFFY: Will. Give me something.
WILLOW: Okay. Um um um, the icon's called the Mark of Gachnar. I think this is a summoning spell for something called…
XANDER: Gachnar?
WILLOW: Yes! Somehow the beginning of the spell was accidentally  triggered. Gachnar's trying to manifest itself. To come into being.
BUFFY: How?
WILLOW: It feeds on… fear.
BUFFY: Our fears are manifesting. We're feeding it. We have to stop.
XANDER: Well if we close our eyes and say it's all just a dream it'll <b>stab us to death</b>. These things are real.
BUFFY: It's feeding on us… if we can get everyone out…
XANDER: Great plan! Let's go!
XANDER: Giles? Look, it's Giles! (then, surprised) With a chainsaw.
ANYA: Xander.
XANDER: Glad you could make it…
GILES: The walls closed up behind us.
BUFFY: (weakly) But… if it did, I could fight…
GILES: Buffy, this is Gachnar.
BUFFY: Okay, let's shut it down.
XANDER: Whatever we're doing, let's do it fast.
GILES: (referencing book) I have it: "The summoning spell for Gachnar can be shut down in one of two ways. Destroying the Mark of Gachnar…"
GILES: "… is not one of them and will, in fact, immediately bring forth  the Fear Demon, itself."
WILLOW: (turning) Look!
BUFFY: This… is Gachnar?
XANDER: Big overture, little show.
WILLOW: He's so cute.
XANDER: (baby-talk) Who's a little fear demon? C'mon, who's a lit-tle fear demon?
GILES: Don't taunt the fear demon.
XANDER: Why? Can he hurt me?
GILES: No, it's just… tacky. Be that as it may, Buffy, when it comes to slaying…
BUFFY: Size doesn't matter?
GACHNAR: They're all going to abandon you, you know.
BUFFY: Yeah, yeah.
OZ: Quality treats here, Giles.
GILES: (reading) Please, finish them.
BUFFY: This is much better. There is no problem that cannot be solved by chocolate.
WILLOW: I think I'm gonna barf.
BUFFY: 'Cept that.
ANYA: What?
XANDER: That's your scary costume?
ANYA: Bunnies frighten me.
BUFFY: What's the matter?
GILES: I should have translated - (showing her book) The Gaelic inscription under the illustration of Gachnar.
BUFFY: What's it say?
GILES: Actual size.
