Just thinking about the life of a pumpkin. Grow up in the sun,  happily entwined with others… Then somebody comes along,  cuts you open and rips your guts out.
The scary house? It sounds a little lame.
As witnessed last Friday.
I'm gonna get going.
I'm sleepy. But you guys have fun.
(shaking her head) I'm cool.
(under her breath) That's what I'd like to know.
What's the next level?
Nobody's pushing, Will. If it's too much, don't do it.
This an "encourage me" talk? I thought it was a "share my pain."
Magic.
See? Concerned boy is sweet boy.
You know, I'm… I forgot to… be hungry…
He didn't. Just don't want to deal right now. Taking  a little holiday from dealing, happily vacationing  in the land of not coping.
Willow, I don't want to meet someone. I've reached my quota on someones. Anyway, I think I should probably patrol.
I'll double-check with Giles, but I'm pretty sure he'll want me on active Slayer duty. He doesn't really care about the whole  "Halloween" thing.
(mortified) Oh. My. God.
And it's on your head.
Giles, what is going on here? You hate Halloween.
Thinking I should patrol tonight. Maybe stake out the cemetery, or some of the more inviting- (re: his hat) Could you please take that off?
No. But then we were caught off guard when your pal Ethan  turned everyone into their costumes.
(re: decorations) Hard to believe.
Excuse me, Professor Walsh…
I came to pick up today's assignment. I wasn't able to get to class because of some personal-
Yeah, I got the impression she wasn't saying it to make me laugh.
(joking weakly) Does stretching count?
Both, actually.
I'll do this stuff tonight.
I just have a lot of -
That's actually a misnomer -
What are you doing?
Scary.
Well, thanks for the pep talk… coach.
No. I mean it.
Thanks again for doing this at the last minute.
Better.
Somebody's getting nostalgic face.
When Little Red Riding Hood was the cutting edge in costumes.
Oh, he was such a pain! Twelve years old and I can't go trick-or-treating by myself.
Nuh-uh, he wanted the candy. I was only the beard.
Not enough, I guess.
Boy, that just paved over Memory Lane, didn't it?
I don't know… I just kinda feel like there's a pattern here. Open your heart to someone and he… he bails on you.  Maybe it would be easier to just not let anyone in anymore.
Why was that?
Weapons.
Just in case. Like the tux, Xander.
Hate to break it to you, but you'll probably end up cool head waiter guy.
Will… Medieval Will.
Like your outfits. Very stealthy.
Perfect. Everybody's got a date but third-wheel Buffy.
Cute.
Terrifying. If I were Abbott and Costello, this would be fairly traumatic.
You're clean.
Why don't we get to the party part of the party.
Blood. (sniffs it) Real blood.
(listening) Shh. Do you hear that? Sounds like "squeaking."
What the hell's going on?
This is the way we came in, right? We just went in a circle.
Thank the Lord.
And you were so anxious for me to come.
Well, once I start dealing with it, I'll get a good idea what it is I'm dealing… (cocks an ear) Do you hear something?
It's like a "sss" noise. 
What is it?
Chaz, what's alive? What happened here?
All right, we get him out of here.
AAHHGH!
I think the cape got most of it.
What closet?
I'm gonna find my way upstairs, see if there's people there. You guys find a way out of the house and use it.
We need help. We need the only person who can make sense of what's happening.
Will, I'm telling you-
I can't do my job if I'm worrying about each of your safety-
Gotta disagree with you there-
And how's it work?
Conjuring? Let's be honest, Will, your basic spells are usually  about fifty-fifty.
What? What does that mean?
(eyes darting around) Xander?!
(calling) Xander! Where are you?
This is so typical of him.
(calling) Xander?
Willow?!
(dawning realization) Basement. I'm in the basement.
Who's there?
(to herself) The Goat Room.
Oz?
We're not okay. We have to get out of here.
What is wrong with you?
No, it brought us here. We got so scared we ended up… here. Why here?
Can you translate?
Will. Give me something.
How?
Our fears are manifesting. We're feeding it. We have to stop.
It's feeding on us… if we can get everyone out…
(weakly) But… if it did, I could fight…
Okay, let's shut it down.
This… is Gachnar?
Size doesn't matter?
Yeah, yeah.
This is much better. There is no problem that cannot be solved by chocolate.
'Cept that.
What's the matter?
What's it say?
