I'm just glad I could find it.
Try it now. I let down the hem and loosened it a little around the neck.
I'm sorry. You look just like that little girl who wore this, what is it, five, six years ago.
Your father used to love taking you out.
He wanted to keep you safe.
Not true. The candy was for me. Your father loved spending time with you.

You know the divorce had nothing to do with you.
I thought it would be easier. (off her look) You must have noticed I'm not the social butterfly I was when I was with your father. I don't think I made one friend the year we moved to Sunnydale.
Fear. I didn't believe I could trust anyone again. It's taken time and a lot of effort, but I've got a nice circle of friends now. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a little gun shy. (an aside) Certainly didn't help that my last boyfriend turned out to be a homicidal robot.
But I'll always be here for you. And you have Mr. Giles. And your friends. You'll see. There's nothing to be afraid of.
