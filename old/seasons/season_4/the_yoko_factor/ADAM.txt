Yes, she makes things interesting.
Then we must ascertain the nature of this variable.
I'm counting on it.
Two slayers…
And you killed them both…
Yet you fear this one.
Do you? Then why haven't you killed this slayer yet?
Yes. Your behavior modification circuitry. I know what you feel…
You feel smothered. Trapped like an animal, pure in its ferocity, unable to actualize the urges within… Clinging to one truth like a flame struggling to burn within an enclosed glass… That a beast this powerful cannot be contained. Inevitably it will break free and savage the land again… I will make you whole again. Make you savage.
I will restore you to what you once were…
When I have the Slayer how and where I want her.
Friends…
Take them away from her.
You can't hurt them. What can you do to make sure they're out of the picture?
Yes.
I think that would be interesting.
Thank you.
You were successful.
You're sure?
I have. I like Helter Skelter.
So you've separated the Slayer from her friends.
I get it. I'm pleased.
No.
There's one more thing.
I've been waiting for you.
