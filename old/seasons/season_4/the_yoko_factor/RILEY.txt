Would this man have a bright red nose and big floppy feet?
Sorry, that's the cabin fever talking. I'm grateful. Really.
I've been trained to survive harsher conditions. All I really need's a sharpened stick, half a canteen of water and… (sighs) … Room service and Spectravision. Don't love doing the survival bit.
I've done wonders with the place. Still. The sooner Buffy's back, the better I'll feel.
I take it you're not an Angel fan, either.
Can't blame you. But, to be fair: It's not him you hate, it's the curse.
Right?
About Angel? Everything. More than I wanted to know, sometimes. She loved him. He turned evil. He killed people. She cured him. He left.
He was cursed. Some kind of gypsy thing. And then… I dunno. Hundred years passed or the moon hit a certain phase or…
What about it?
And that sets him off.
Buffy.
Sex. With Buffy.
(numb) Yeah, me too. (beat) Well, that explains a lot of things I wish weren't explained.
And she went running to L.A. to bone up on her history.
Maybe.
Guess we'll see.
Hi. I got a little tired of sitting around waiting, so…
(entering) Xander took my clothes to clean 'em. Left me these. Does he hate me in some way I don't know about yet? I think I would've attracted less attention in my uniform.
You tell me.
I'm good.
Took me awhile, but I patched into their frequency. Can't sneak up on a guy if he's listening in.
Why they hired me.
Are you okay?
How?
Got my attention.
You don't want to talk about it.
It's the pants, isn't it? It's okay. I couldn't take me seriously in these things either.
Tell you what, why don't I get out of your face. You had a long trip.
It's okay. Besides… (re: pants) I gotta re-charge them every two hours or they go dead on me.
I know you?
(realizes) Angel.
Way I heard it, you were all peaceable now. You didn't by any chance go and lose that pesky soul again, did you?
(contained rage) Now what could possibly have happened with Buffy that would make you lose your soul?
Where do you think you're going?
You think I'm gonna let that happen?
I surely do.
I told you you weren't coming near her.
I meant it.
It's pretty much all I got left, so I'm thinking not. He attacked four of my men, Buffy. He's up to his old tricks.
Please try.
Trigger finger feels okay.
Ow!
I'm sorry, I just wanted to know you were safe.
What?
I'm not leaving this room. I mean it.
Not moving a muscle…
Not sure yet. The night's still young.
Figured.
I'm fine.
Wait. Me, first. Buffy… I feel like we've gotten really close. At least, I thought we had. I don't know much about Angel, or your relationship with him. But all I ask is, if you're gonna break my heart? Do it fast.
Didn't you?
So - nothing?
I don't know. Xander said-
(cutting her off) No. It wasn't his fault. I prodded, and he explained <u>how</u> Angel went bad. The trigger-
(rambling) And, after that, I went a little nuts, you know? I mean, on the one hand, I should believe in us. But, on the other, sometimes things just happen between ex's and then I saw he was bad-
Seriously? That's a "good" day? (off her nod) Well there you go. Even when he's good he's all Mr. Billowy Coat King of Pain and girls really-
See? Nuts.
No.
Because I'm so in love with you I can't think straight.
Just say it.
I have to go.
Have to go now.
And now I'm here.
