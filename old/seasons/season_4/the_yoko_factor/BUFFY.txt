Riley. Hi.
… You joined the circus?
Is it okay for you to be here?
I mean, with a whole government branch hunting you down and all.
You're the trickiest.
Yeah. I'm fine, it's just … Angel kind of upset me.
It's not that interesting.
He spun my head a little. I assure you: not of the big.
Deconstructing Angel really can wait. I want to get out there and patrol. Find Adam. Talk about it later?
Riley, it's not that big of a deal.
You don't have to go.
Okay, then… see ya.
Give me a reason not to.
Not yet. Beating you senseless should do just fine.
I'm checking out that cave.
Alone?
Family? Last time I dropped by you put a gun to my head. What kind of family are you guys? The Corleones?
What, no girls in the club?
A future? A future doing what? Illegal experiments? Torture? Murder? I guess killing someone isn't a problem for you.
Touch me again you'll find out what Slayer-strength is like.
Get out of here.
(to Forrest) GO!
Xander, it's Buffy.
Xander?
Xander, call me. I think we need to get the gang together.
Hi, uh, Tara? It's Buffy. I'm looking for Willow. If you see her, would you tell her? I - it's pretty important. Thanks.
Giles. It's me. Just … call me.
Angel…
I guess.
Oh. Come in.
You hurt?
Want to tell me who ran you into that doorknob?
Let me guess. You thought of something else really hurtful to say and it was just too good to do it over the phone. 'Cause the funniest part is the look on my face --
Why not? What's going --
You've <u>got</u> to be kidding me. (glares at Angel) <u>This</u> is why you came?
Running your car into a tree is an accident. Running your fist into somebody's face is a plan. You wanna explain this to me?
Oh… Riley - he's not. He isn't bad now. He won't hurt anybody. Angel, tell him…
Stop it!
That's enough! I see any more displays of testosterone poisoning, I will personally put you both in the hospital. Anybody think I'm exaggerating?
(points - don't you dare) NNH!
Riley…
I need to talk to Angel for a minute.
Riley, please.
Okay.
Okay. I come to see you, to <u>help</u> you and you treat me like I'm just… your ex-
<u>Shut up</u>. (he clams up) Then you order me out of <u>your</u> city - and then you come here and start pounding on my boyfriend?! What is this? I'd really like to know: What the <u>hell</u> are you trying to do?
Swell. Although you might want to think about fire. Burning things - always effective.
I… and Riley?
Put yourself in his place.
Look, I… you weren't entirely wrong, what you said in L.A. We don't live in each other's worlds anymore. I can't just barge in on yours and make judgments.
Thank you.
They really are.
Honestly, I think the best thing right now --
It means a lot that you came.
Yeah.
Thanks.
How bad are you hurt?
I have something to tell you.
Maybe you should sit down.
Riley…
What? You think… that Angel and I…
Of course not. I'd never do that to you.
Nothing. Riley. How can you even ask that?
(fuming) Xander. He is the deadest man in Deadonia-
Oh.
He wasn't bad.
Riley. Stop.
Have I ever given you reason to feel you couldn't trust me?
Then why with the crazy?
Tell me about it.
Ry…
I still have to tell you something. And - there's no way to…
Forrest is dead.
I'm so sorry… There was a fight. Adam killed him. I barely got away.
I know nothing I say can make things better. But I swear to you, we will find and destroy this thing. Right now you need time. Take what you need, I can…
Are you sure? You…
It's all weird and jumbley.
Okay. So how long before you… uncrypt it?
(to Will re: disk) I can't just wait around, Will. That disk is no good to me unless you crack it soon-
Sorry everyone, but we're on a clock here. Adam was at that cave. Maybe he was there for a reason. I can go back, scope it out, track him if I have to…
Giles?!
You're not coming, Xander. You'd get hurt. It'll be easier for me if I'm not worrying about protecting you.
Willow stays behind too. I'll do it alone.
Guys, you're just making this harder.
The army?
<u>Us</u> talking about <u>you</u>? How about you telling Riley every last detail of my life with Angel--
(to Giles) Are you <u>drunk</u>?
Well, stop it. (to Willow and Xander) This is stupid.
I don't think you're stupid, Xander, so stop being an idiot and help me fix things. I need both of you. I need you all the time, just not now. Adam is dangerous--
I need you a lot. You're great, with, with the computer. Usually.
(ignoring him) And you got the witch-stuff… that's…
What is happening? This is crazy.
Judgmental? If I was any more open minded about the choices you two make my whole brain would fall out.
Guys, stop this. What happened to you today?
Willow, what do you mean things have been wrong? Things don't have to be wrong, do they?
Enough. All I know is that you want to help, right? Be part of the team?
No. You said you wanted to go. So let's go. All of us. We'll walk into that cave with you two attacking me and the funny drunk drooling on my shoes. Maybe that's the secret way to kill Adam.
Is that it? Is that how you can help? You're not answering. Go on. How can you possibly help?
So… (steeling herself) So I guess I'm on my own. And you know what? I'm starting to get why there's no ancient prophesy about a Chosen One and Friends.
If I need help, I'll go to someone I can <u>count on</u>.
