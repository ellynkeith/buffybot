That's not the point. I've always been Riley's second-in-command. Instead he picks a girl.
Whatever. Three guesses what that boy's thinking with.
Hey, I'm not under anybody's shadow.
Target?
Alert control and Alpha team. We've tagged Hostile 17 with a tracer and are in pursuit.
I mean, the blip's now a blob. There's some kind of interference messing with the tracer.
I think so. But it's gonna put us in populated areas.
Signal's somewhere in this neighborhood. Estimate within a two block radius.
Wait! Signal's cleared up. (pointing) There!
It's on the move.
Straight at us. Forty meters and closing. Moving fast.
Twenty-five meters. Twenty. Fifteen.
To the left. Ten meters. Five.
This doesn't make any sense. Went right past us.
