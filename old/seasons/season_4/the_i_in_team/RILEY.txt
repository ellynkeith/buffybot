(grinning) Got it.
See? You're a hit.
We don't have to do this.
If you're not ready. I mean, if you'd rather wait...
Okay.
You're going to do fine. (off her nod) Just a tour.
Then its a good thing we have the buddy system.
That panel -- Say something into it.
Don't like to brag.
Can't really talk about it.
She's joking.
Tough. Took eight of us to bring those two down.
(to Buffy) It's a prototype for a COM-CAM... (off her look) Communications camera. Soon to be standard issue. Gives us a direct com-link to Control when we're out in the field.
Hope you don't mind us tagging along.
(re buddies) This is Forrest, Graham, that's Tuck and he's Mason. We're going to get some drinks. Anybody wanting?
(to Buffy) That's our cue. Mother wants us.
(stepping forward) Okay, listen up. We'll be going in a four squad set-up. Team leaders: Gates, Taggart, Stavros... Alpha Team, you're with me.
What?
It's... a little unusual. She's just not used to it. Maybe 'cause you barely ever opened your mouth in her classroom. But I know she likes you. In fact, she liked you before I did.
Told me so herself.
(interrupting her) Buffy, can we talk about this later? There's a dangerous Hostile out here and since I don't have your reflexes, I kind of need to focus.
This is Alpha Team, go ahead.
Say again, Beta team. You're breaking--
Conner! On my mark!
Now!
Hey.
What's the matter? Weren't expecting to see me?
Reminder to take my vitamins.
I am how they trained me.
You know, the government. Plucked me out of Special Ops training for this.
Didn't. You learn in the military to follow orders, not ask questions.
I know all I need to know. We're doing good here. Protecting the public. Removing the Sub-terrestrial threat... it's work worth doing.
(into phone) Riley.
On my way.
Don't know.
I'll leave that to you.
No, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
What do you mean "the signal's whacked?"
Lock it down. Are we heading in the right general direction?
Okay, then. We change into civies. Then we move. Spread out. Maybe something'll turn up.
Talk to me, Forrest.
Okay, we want to keep this Hostile contained, so no one is to make a move without--
Let's go!
What?
Heading?
Look alive, people. Weapons at the ready.
Where?
Anyone?
(to himself) Flushed. (to others) Tracer's been flushed.
Regret to report Hostile 17 is still at large. I've left Beta team to comb the area, but the tracer's--
Buffy?
What?
I-I don't understand. How could this happen?
