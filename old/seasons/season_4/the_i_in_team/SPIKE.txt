Wipe your feet when you enter a person's home.
(re crypt) I'll admit... bit of a fixer-upper. Needs a woman's touch. (then) Care to have a crack at it?
Like hearing about the "pain" part, but stuff the gratitude. You owe me more than that, mate.
I'll do that.
Aagh. Made me lose count. What are  you still doing here?
Well, piss off then. This piece of business wraps up any I got with you - and your slayerettes. From here on, I want nothing to do with the lot of you.
You and yours'll just have to show a little restraint, is all. Get out.
And I don't want you crawling back here, knocking on my door, pleading for help the second teen witch's magic goes all wonky or Little Xander cuts a new tooth... We're through, got it? Honeymoon is over.
Close the door!
Soldier boys are out in force. Been trying to get 'em off my scent, running 'em in circles, but they keep coming.
Yeah, awright... Whataya want me  to say? I need help. (to Giles) And no cheek from you.
Look. Buggers shot me. In the back.
Because... You do that. You're the goody-good guys. You're the bloody, frickin' calvary!
Oh! 'Cause I helped you. When you turned into a Fyarl demon. I helped you, din' I?
Hell, no. I made you pay m-- (pauses, getting it) You right bastard...
It's all that's left. Spent the rest on blood and smokes. (muttering) Which I'll never see again.
Well, come on. Circle the wagons. Tend to the wounded here. No time for layabouts.
Oww! Watch it! That hurts.
Also: not tranquil.
I don't care if it's playing "Rockin' the Casbah" on the bloody Jew's Harp, just get it out of me.
What, you gonna get snockered now?
A what?
I'm not going anywhere. Not until those bastards undo whatever they did to me. Put me back the way I was.
(considering it) Think that'll work?
