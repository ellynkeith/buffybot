Hey. I was in the library when the quake hit. Almost got buried in 19th Century English Literature. And I don't have to tell you how hard it is to dig through some of that stuff.
You okay?
Well, Porter Dorm is completely blacked out, so naturally they're dealing with the crisis the only way they know how: "Aftershock Party."
They do seem to be generous with the milestones. You should ask Riley to come. Much carousing by flattering candlelight.
Anything wrong?
(excited) Percy! Hi!
Oh, stuff. Thought you got that football scholarship to USC.
Hi. Some party, huh?
Oh. Oz. Well, um, actually, he's--
Yeah, catch you...
Buffy'll get here soon. Then the fun'll start.
(to herself) Buffy. Where are you?
Hello? Anyone in here?
Buffy. Over here.
I'm so glad you're here.
I found him. A guy on the bed. With me. Dead. Not me dead. He dead.
So much blood. Godfather horse-head amounts of blood, hold the horse. And there was a symbol and Percy said I was a nerd.
We should probably report to Giles, get started on the demon tracking. Save lives and stuff.
It just made me feel like I was right back in high school.
...of course, the Percy thing isn't really important. It's the dead guy on the bed.
Oh! And something else. He -- the dead guy -- was propped up, like whatever killed him wanted to drain the blood out of him. Only there wasn't so much blood there. And so I'm thinking the whatever took a bunch of the guy's blood with it. (then, still upset) And I haven't been a nerd for a long time. Hello, dating a guitarist? Or, I was...
(searching her pockets) Oh, right. It was carved right into his chest. Like a big creepy eye.
Again?!
It just can't be. We did this already.
What do we do?
Eww.
It has to be a spell of some kind. Something that uses blood and bones.
Bones of a child, though. I saw that... (spots the passage) An ancient ritual -- it uses the blood of a man, the bones of a child, and... and something called the Word of Valios. It's all part of a, a sacrifice. "The sacrifice of three."
Well, yeah. But it's not big with the details. It doesn't say how the world ends - or what the ritual entails, exactly.
If he doesn't already have it. I mean, who knows where he's been?
What are you doing!?
Xander-
Well - I don't know - it's ooky. We know him. We can't just let him poof! himself.
(trying) Well, the shirt is, kinda. And-
I'm sorry. it's just not right. And besides - you still haven't told Buffy everything about the commandos.
We can't just leave him like this. We'll have to take him with us to the museum.
Great. No Word of Valios.
You shouldn't talk like that, Spike. Okay - you can't kill anymore. But there are other fun things you can do. You'll adjust.
(cutting him off) I see what you're doing. You're trying to get us to dust you-
We are not useless! We - we help people. We fight the forces of evil-
You're not. Now sit.
If we leave him alone he'll stake himself-
Will do.
I think we're near the-
-library. Wow. Check out the new floor plan.
I don't see any sacrifice people.
Spike!
Spike! Not in the-
(dubious) You were just passing by... in your GI Joe outfit?
You too. If you hadn't figured out that "demons are the sacrifice" thing - we'd all be hell babies by now.
Again.
Yeah. Everything looked so much smaller. And more charred and ruin-y.
