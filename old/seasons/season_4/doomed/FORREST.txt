Slayer? Thrash band. Anvil-heavy guitar rock with delusions of Black Sabbath.
Oh. The Slayer. Oh, yeah, man. I've heard of the slayer.
Well, the way I got it figured, Slayer's like some kind of Bogeyman for the Sub-Terrestrials. Something they tell their little spawn to get them to eat their vegetables and clean up their slime pits.
(snickering) Oh, wait a sec. Am I bursting somebody's bubble here? Maybe this is a bad time to tell you about Lara Croft. And the Easter bunny.
Sorry. Sorry. It's a myth, Rye. All part of that medieval folklore garbage kooks dream up to explain the things we deal with everyday.
(shrugs) They're just animals, man. Plain and simple. Granted, a little rarer than the ones you grew up with on that little farm in Smallville, but--

Hey. Ground control to Major Finn. You're up.
Okay, that makes oh-for-a-billion. You don't got game, son. What's going on in that head of yours?
Yes, already. She's cool. She's hot. She's tepid. She's all- temperature Buffy. Can we just concentrate on the game here?
Good block. You should use your face more often.
HST attack?
(to Riley) Should we mobilize?
Can't tell where it's going. But I've got a bead on where it's been. Residual traces showing up in populated areas. Thing's not shy.
Pick up quadrant assignments from me... we'll blanket the town.
Can I have a minute, man?
We have some giant ass creepy crawly out there, and you're chatting up your honey? Might want to check your priorities.
I don't know about this girl, man. She's got you whupped something fierce, and you haven't even-
Carrying on.
