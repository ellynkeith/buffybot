Oh. It's you.
(encouraged) Hey, yeah. I did. I scared you. Give me money.
You're not "paying" me. I'm robbing you.
Oh. I was, just a minute ago. Hang on, get me mad again.
Yeah, it works! Keeps me in blood and beers. Plus, you know, funny. Watching the little humans quail.
Look who's talking! I don't see  droopy-boy on yer arm. Did he have  better things to do?
Yeah. Tell me about it.
You know, you take the killing for granted, and then it's gone and you're like, I wish I'd appreciated it more. Stopped and smelled the corpses you know?
Terrible thing, love is. Been there  myself. Ended badly.
We should just go do the vengeance. Both of us. You go eviscerate Xander, I'll stake Dru. Like, a project.
Yeah. I will. (beat) Maybe later.
Hey-I know these guys from somewhere.
What are you doing? You brought me <u>here</u>?
That's what I said. Only I hit the "here" part.
Oh, who's a puffed-up manly man? All multi-colored and possessive.
Yeah. I get now what you said about  him earlier. No follow-through.
Hmm. May be some fun to be had in the lion's den after all. You two keep  scrapping,, I'll go find the liquor.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Well. This party's starting to  liven up after allâ€¦
I am.
