No, no, I don't mind at all. I was up. Early morning prayer, of course.
Oh yes. I fed them, clothed them, educated them in the way of the Lord. I was given a medal.
I don't understand.
Well, that sounds like crazy talk.
Some got the flu and such. No one died if that's what you mean. The engraving on the medal says how good I was with the children.
Treated them as I would have my own flesh and blood. Gave them hugs and praise when they were good. Punished them when they were dirty.
My kids didn't think I knew. But I did.
Without me, they would have been shut out of the Kingdom, lost to lust.
(nods) The girls fell to vanity more than the boys. I'd see them preening like  Jezebel, doting over their pretty hairâ€¦
(sternly) I'd remove the temptation to admire themselves. They were better for it.
I performed Baptisms for the most unclean. Those who were tainted with impure thought and deed.
They <u>needed</u> to be reborn. You choose to pass judgment on me?
I refuse to listen to this when I can smell the sin on each and every one of you!
