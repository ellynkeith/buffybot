RILEY: What?!
BUFFY: You take fang. I'll get horny. (beat) I mean…
RILEY: Don't recall ever seeing that before.
BUFFY: 'Cause it never happens. Demons hate  vamps. They're like stripes and  polka-dots. Major clashing.
RILEY: Right.
BUFFY: I mean, it's the kind of thing he'd  want to know.
RILEY: Mm-hmm.
BUFFY: Like… As soon as possible…
RILEY: Soon as possible.
BUFFY: Okay, I mean it now, first thing in the morning we go tell Giles.
RILEY: First thing. Good plan.
XANDER: Aw, c'mon, big party at Riley's house, gonna be fun. Why don't you want to go?
ANYA: You know why not. Those Initiative men make me… not comfortable. (then) And you don't care!
XANDER: They don't know you're an ex-demon. And we don't know that they'd care even if they did know you're an ex-demon. Which, by the way, they're not going to find out. Anyway, they'll be too busy flirting with every other girl at the party to even notice you.
ANYA: Oh. So you don't think I'm desirable  enough to be flirted with, is that it?
XANDER: I'm just not gonna win here, am I?
ANYA: You don't find me attractive anymore.
XANDER: What are you talking about? I think you're gorgeous.
ANYA: Oh, really? Then why didn't we have sex last night?
XANDER: Is that what this is about? We've gone other  nights without sex.
XANDER: Breaking--? We're not! Are we?
ANYA: Oh of course we are. You've obviously grown tired of me. I've seen it happen to thousands of women over the centuries. I  just never thought it would happen to me.
XANDER: Anya, there's a lot more to you and me than the sex. (off her look) Well, there should be. I mean, a  relationship is something you have to work at… work <u>through</u>… together.
ANYA: I don't understand - I'm pretty. I'm young… Why didn't you take advantage of me? Is something wrong with your body?
XANDER: There's nothing wrong with my body.
ANYA: There must be. I saw that wrinkled man on TV talking about erectile dysfunction -
XANDER: (defensive) Whoa! Hey! All systems go here. No function thing, okay? You want sex?  Let's have sex. Right here, you and me,  big, sweaty, <u>sex</u>.
GILES: (to Buffy) And yet you say that the vampire went to the demon's aid… The two of them working as a team.
BUFFY: Everything except giving each other  little pats on the behind.
GILES: Extraordinarily odd. As a rule, demons have no empathy for species other than their own. In fact, most consider vampires abominations - mixing with human blood and all.
WILLOW: So what brought these two together?
RILEY: Not "what." Who.
GILES: (understanding) Adam.
BUFFY: Think about it. Who better to bring a bunch of demon types together than someone that's made up of a bunch of demon types?
TARA: So he's, um, bridging the gap between the races?
WILLOW: Huh. Like Martin Luther King. (thinks a moment) But probably a lot less eloquent… and with the… evil… so, different than Martin Luther King. Let's move on.
GILES: Well, I'd suggest that for the next several nights, you two concentrate your patrol in that same area. If you find any other peculiar pairings or groupings let me know.
RILEY: I'll let the squad know as well. They're patrolling; we'll have a reserve unit out during the party.
GILES: Party?
RILEY: Tomorrow night. We're having a thing.
GILES: At a time like this? Whose idea was that?
RILEY: (unapologetic) Mine. Boys are pretty ragged. Need to let off steam.
GILES: Point taken.
RILEY: You're welcome to come…
GILES: Much as I long for a good kegger, I have plans. The Espresso Pump.
TARA: What are you doing?
GILES: I'm… it's a meeting of grown-ups. It couldn't possible be of interest to you lot.
WILLOW: (hurt, accusing) You have grown-up friends?
GILES: A few.
RILEY: Hey, Buffy, look at the time. Don't you have a class?
BUFFY: In twenty minutes.
RILEY: Yeah but, you've got that… thing… that…
BUFFY: That we could squeeze in… before class.
RILEY: Gotta run.
BUFFY: Bye.
WILLOW: (conspiratorially) They're probably going back to -
GILES: Yes. Thank you Willow. I did actually attend university in the Mesozoic era. I remember what it's like.
FORREST: Didn't we just get the furnace fixed? It's freezing!
GRAHAM: I'll call in the a.m. Get somebody to come out and-
FORREST: You've gotta be kidding me when do  those two ever come up for air?
GRAHAM: Slaves to the rhythm.
FORREST: Room shoulda warmed up by now.
MASON: (re: fire) I've been building this thing for an hour.  Still an icebox in here.
GRAHAM: Don't bother, Mason. We've got a couple of heat generators pumping away upstairs.
GRAHAM: GEEEZ!
FORREST: Call a medic! Get help!
SPIKE: Oh. It's you.
ANYA: Spike. What are you doing? You made me yell really high.
SPIKE: (encouraged) Hey, yeah. I did. I scared you. Give me money.
ANYA: I'm not paying you for scaring me.
SPIKE: You're not "paying" me. I'm robbing you.
ANYA: Oh. Well that's just ludicrous. You can't hurt me because you've got a chip in your brain. Also, I like my money the way it is when it's mine.
SPIKE: Oh. I was, just a minute ago. Hang on, get me mad again.
ANYA: Does that really work? Scaring people into giving you their money?
SPIKE: Yeah, it works! Keeps me in blood and beers. Plus, you know, funny. Watching the little humans quail.
ANYA: I'm beginning to understand why you're so friendless.
SPIKE: Look who's talking! I don't see  droopy-boy on yer arm. Did he have  better things to do?
FORREST: Are you kidding? Mason <u>requested</u> patrol tonight!
GRAHAM: He just didn't want the girls to see him with his eyebrows burned off.
FORREST: He's lucky that's all he lost.
GRAHAM: Shoulda seen it, Rye. It was weird as hell.
RILEY: Mm-hmm?
WILLOW: How many little kids.
XANDER: I don't know. A whole herd of 'em. And  some parents. It was pretty embarrassing, which, welcome to life with Anya.
TARA: So you don't even know if she's coming tonight?
XANDER: I'm thinking no. She was pretty mad.  And I'm starting to wonder, is it me?  Am I the crazy one?
BUFFY: (absently) Uh-huh. Absolutely.
WILLOW: Hey Buffy, This might be a good time to mention that someone so not me spilled  something purpley on your new peasant  top that I would never borrow without  asking. You love me?
BUFFY: Uh-huh. (then) Huh? What about my peasant top?
WILLOW: Nothing.
TARA: Xander was talking about Anya.
XANDER: It's nothing much, just feeling glad right now that a certain ex-demon doesn't have any powers.
SPIKE: Yeah. Tell me about it.
ANYA: A year and half ago I could've eviscerated him with my thoughts.  Now I can barely hurt his feelings. Things used to be so much simpler.
SPIKE: You know, you take the killing for granted, and then it's gone and you're like, I wish I'd appreciated it more. Stopped and smelled the corpses you know?
ANYA: Yeah. Now everything's so complicated.
SPIKE: Terrible thing, love is. Been there  myself. Ended badly.
ANYA: Of course it did. It always does. I've seen thousands of relationships. First there's the love and sex. Then there's nothing left but the vengeance. That's how it works.
SPIKE: We should just go do the vengeance. Both of us. You go eviscerate Xander, I'll stake Dru. Like, a project.
ANYA: I don't know… I just can't. You can go do Dru though.
SPIKE: Yeah. I will. (beat) Maybe later.
ROY: See, the thing they're afraid to teach  us about is the inherent sensuality of  language. You learn French and they  make it all about conjugations and  fronted vowels and no one ever talks  about… you know…
CHRISTY: Are you all right?
ROY: Fine.
CHRISTY: You really like French.
XANDER: (off banner) Lowell House, 1962.
JULIE: Yes?
XANDER: Um. Just, you know, impressing you with my knowledge of local history. Or my knowledge of reading.
JULIE: You didn't even have to sound  anything out.
XANDER: You should see me add short columns of small numbers.
JULIE: You're funny.
XANDER: Thanks… that is… funny "how  amusing" or funny "back away and avoid eye contact?
JULIE: Kind of both. Who are you here with?
XANDER: Right now I seem to be here with you.
BUFFY: Riley, can we… (indicates the stairs to his room) I just… I want your opinion on… an essay. For a class.
RILEY: Oh, that essay. (to the guys) Catch you guys in a minute. Essay thing.
GRAHAM: And <u>I'm</u> the one who got a 'D' in covert ops.
ROY: Evan, c'mere. You gotta see this.
EVAN: (points down hall) I'm getting a beer.
ROY: First, just, just put your hand right here.
EVAN: Okay… somehow this is a trick, I  know it…
ROY: Now stay… Don't move.
EVAN: Whoa. What is that? I kinda feel…
ROY: Told you you'd like it. Someone call China. Our wall is greater.
WILLOW: Horses? Like, big, tall, teeth-that could- take-your-arm-off horses?
TARA: Sure. I learned to ride when I was a kid. It's fun. And, by the way, most horses don't like arm very much.
WILLOW: I had a bad birthday party pony thing when I was four. I look at horses, I just see really big ponies.
TARA: You should ride with me sometime. I guarantee safety and fun.
WILLOW: Well, if you promise to look after me…
TARA: DON'T TOUCH ME!
WILLOW: Tara, what's the matter?
TARA: I don't kn-kn-know.
WILLOW: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to… (beat) Are you feeling okay?
TARA: I'm f-fine. I just want t-to go to the bathr-room.
SPIKE: Hey-I know these guys from somewhere.
ANYA: Initiative soldiers. They live here. The experiments happen in the lab under  the house. That's where they kept you and put in your chip. Let's have fun.
SPIKE: What are you doing? You brought me <u>here</u>?
XANDER: Anya?!
SPIKE: That's what I said. Only I hit the "here" part.
XANDER: Anya. This is crazy. We had a little fight. that just means we need to work our way through some stuff. It doesn't mean you rebound with the evil undead. And what  have you been doing with him, anyway?
SPIKE: Oh, who's a puffed-up manly man? All multi-colored and possessive.
ANYA: (to Spike) It's not very convincing is it?
SPIKE: Yeah. I get now what you said about  him earlier. No follow-through.
XANDER: Hey, what a surprise, HOSTILE  SEVENTEEN! Can I get you a drink, HOSTILE SEVENTEEN!?
ANYA: Xander, stop!
SPIKE: Hmm. May be some fun to be had in the lion's den after all. You two keep  scrapping,, I'll go find the liquor.
XANDER: Anya, what are you doing with him.
ANYA: We didn't have sex, if that's what you  mean. That's all I do now, not have sex.
XANDER: You're overreacting. We had a fight. But, see, that's okay. It's normal.
ANYA: Yes. It's part of the normal ending of a relationship right before the  vengeance begins.
XANDER: Right. No. Vengeance?
ANYA: Relax. I'm not going to do it. I'm just trying to tell you that we have nothing in common aside from both liking your penis. And now I don't even have that. So I get to say when it's done and it's done.
XANDER: Okay, you know what? You don't deserve to be the one to walk away from this. I've put up with a hell of a lot from you - much of it in the last minute - and if anyone gets to be the one to leave it's me.
ANYA: You're leaving me?
XANDER: Yes. I am.
ANYA: Where are you going?
XANDER: To enjoy the party.
ANYA: Then I'm staying too. To… to show you how much I'm not bothered by you having fun. Because… because I'll be having <u>more</u> fun.
XANDER: (called after, angry) I'm having fun already!
ANYA: (called after, more angry) Me too. Whoo-hoo!
XANDER: Huh. Sometimes I just don't get the sophisticated college lifestyle.
GUY: Hey buddy, you look familiar.
SPIKE: Yeah, I get that a lot.
JULIE: Hey Xander.
XANDER: Julie. Okay. This then would be the kissing.
JULIE: I'm sorry… I didn't… Sorry…
XANDER: Hi, uh… you okay?
JULIE: I'm bad… I'm bad… I'm bad…
WILLOW: Tara? It's me.
RILEY: Was that Willow?
BUFFY: I don't know.
WILLOW: Tara! Xander!?
XANDER: Guys, the girl, Julie, she's freaking out. Anyone friends with Julie?
WILLOW: Ghost boy, drowning in the tub. I tried to save him but, being a ghost  already… well, I was way too late.
XANDER: A ghost? What's the deal, is every frat on this campus haunted? And if so, why do people keep coming to these parties? 'Cause it's not the snacks.
WILLOW: I don't know-
TARA: I'm okay, but… I don't like it here. This house. I think we should go.
WILLOW: We need Buffy.
XANDER: (yelling) Buffy?
WILLOW: Buffy! Riley!?
XANDER: BUFFY!!
RILEY: Do you want to go back?
BUFFY: Never.
WILLOW: Buffy! Riley!
XANDER: BUFFY!
FORREST: Graham! Quit standing around -  help get these people to safety!
GRAHAM: (babbling) Touch not the impure thing…
FORREST: What?!?
GRAHAM: … for ye shall perish. Find salvation in the cross of our lord and saviour…
FORREST: Right.
SPIKE: Well. This party's starting to  liven up after all…
XANDER: Anya, we gotta get out of here. Come on…
JULIE: Help me… oh God, help me…
FORREST: We got trouble upstairs. Some kind of disembodied presence in the house.
SCIENTIST: We've been paging you.
FORREST: Whatever this thing's outputting must have scrambled all frequencies.
SCIENTIST: Guard Section Two. Level five  precautions. If the cell door locking mechanisms malfunction, you know  what to do.
FORREST: Got it.
GRAHAM: (head clearing) I'm good.
FORREST: Let's lock it down.
WILLOW: Wait! We have to go back!
ANYA: Why?
XANDER: Because Buffy and Riley are trapped.
ANYA: So? She's the slayer, he's a big soldier boy. What do they need you for?
XANDER: Look around, Anya. There's ghosts and shaking and people going all Felicity with their hair… We're fresh out of  super-people and somebody's got to go back in there. Now who's with me?
SPIKE: I am.
ANYA: Xander, let's get out of here.
XANDER: You want to bail? Fine. I'm going back in there and I'm not coming out 'til I bring my friend with me.
WILLOW: We'll got to Giles'.
TARA: Now wait- he's not there. He was going to the Espresso Pump.
WILLOW: Right. He told us not to come. Said he wanted some grown-up time.
ANYA: Oh…
WILLOW: (shock) …Wow…
XANDER: Um, could we go back to the haunted house? Because this is creeping me out.
TARA: Does he do this a lot?
XANDER: Sure, every day the earth rotates backward and the skies turn orange.
WILLOW: Now I remember why I used to have such a crush on him.
TARA: He <u>is</u> pretty good…
ANYA: His voice is pleasant.
XANDER: What?
WILLOW: Come on, it's a little sexy…
XANDER: I'm fighting total mental  breakdown, here, Will. No more  fuel on the fire, please.
GILES: What are you doing here? I believe I <u>stressed</u> that you were not to come here.
XANDER: Sorry to step behind the music, but…
WILLOW: It's Buffy.
BUFFY: You're too far away from me.
RILEY: I'm right here.
BUFFY: You have to keep touching me.
GILES: And when you called to Buffy and Riley, they didn't cry out, or respond in any way?
ANYA: No. They're prob'ly dead.
XANDER: Unless they were too busy doing it to answer.
GILES: Doing what?
XANDER: You know, for a god of acoustic rock you're kind of naïve.
GILES: Well I didn't think you meant - in the middle of all that, do you really think they'd be keeping it up? Oh, for a different phrasing…
WILLOW: That's the thing. People all over the party were starting to act weird… sexually.
GILES: In what ways?
WILLOW: (avoiding) You know. Ways.
GILES: (thinks) It could be some form of succubi, or a satyr's prank. It could even be  energy coming from the lab beneath  Lowell fraternity.
WILLOW: It wasn't always a frat. Look.
TARA: Children? Did any of them… um… die in there?
GILES: If there were any deaths… then perhaps we have a fairly standard haunting.
WILLOW: (shakes head 'no') Doesn't say. It's really just about the old house director, "Genevieve Holt … Sunnydale Children's Aid… thirty years of community service, giving disadvantaged kids the love and care they deserve."
GILES: When did <u>she</u> die?
WILLOW: She didn't.
HOLT: No, no, I don't mind at all. I was up. Early morning prayer, of course.
GILES: I guess you were like their mother. Did everything for them.
HOLT: Oh yes. I fed them, clothed them, educated them in the way of the Lord. I was given a medal.
GILES: Yes, that's wonderful. Congratulations. (beat) Um, this may seem strange, but, did you ever notice any… odd  disturbances? In the house?
HOLT: I don't understand.
GILES: Like, furniture moving around… by itself. Objects appearing out of  nowhere. Or, perhaps you'd think you  saw a person one moment - but then they were gone? Inexplicably?
HOLT: Well, that sounds like crazy talk.
GILES: Yes, I know it does. Um… then forgive me for asking this but… of the children you cared for, were any of them ill? Or, did anything… happen to them?
HOLT: Some got the flu and such. No one died if that's what you mean. The engraving on the medal says how good I was with the children.
GILES: Yes.
HOLT: Treated them as I would have my own flesh and blood. Gave them hugs and praise when they were good. Punished them when they were dirty.
GILES: Kids will be kids. They like to play in the muck.
ANYA: You… didn't mean muddy-dirty?
HOLT: My kids didn't think I knew. But I did.
GILES: Very, uh, perceptive of you.
HOLT: Without me, they would have been shut out of the Kingdom, lost to lust.
GILES: But you "helped" them.
HOLT: (nods) The girls fell to vanity more than the boys. I'd see them preening like  Jezebel, doting over their pretty hair…
XANDER: (gets it/angry) So you'd hack it off.
HOLT: (sternly) I'd remove the temptation to admire themselves. They were better for it.
ANYA: What about the bathtub? Something happened there.
HOLT: I performed Baptisms for the most unclean. Those who were tainted with impure thought and deed.
GILES: You held them under.
HOLT: They <u>needed</u> to be reborn. You choose to pass judgment on me?
GILES: Well, someone ought to. You  traumatized and abused these children, who are now, may I add, undoubtedly  extremely disturbed adults. You ruined lives, Mrs. Holt. Not to mention the fact that what you did has now manifested  itself as a murderous presence that  threatens still more lives. You have a great deal to answer for!
HOLT: I refuse to listen to this when I can smell the sin on each and every one of you!
XANDER: Yeah! You smell sin? Well, let me tell you something, lady. She who smelt it, dealt it! (Off Giles' look) It's like what you said, but faster.
XANDER: (genuinely angry) This totally feeds into my 'old people are creepy' theorem.
ANYA: I don't get it. I mean, those kids were tortured. But they weren't killed, so where are the ghosts coming from?
GILES: I don't believe there are any ghosts.
ANYA: But one ran right through me-
GILES: Not a ghost, an apparition. I think  we're dealing with a kind of  Poltergeist, a cluster of them in fact, born out of intense adolescent emotion and sexual energy.
ANYA: Both of which were totally pent-up during Mrs. Holt's reign of repression.
XANDER: So, with Buffy and Riley having, you know, acts of nakedness 'round the clock lately… Maybe they set something free. Like a big bursting poltergasm.
GILES: (working it out) Yes. And now the poltergeists are drawing more and more of that energy out of them. Feeding on it. Buffy and Riley are powering this whole thing.
XANDER: Okay, they're the battery in the boo factory. So, what happens when the battery is drained?
GILES: (a beat) They die.
BUFFY: Don't…
ANYA: What good are weapons against disembodied spirits, Xander?  They've got no ass to kick.
GILES: She's right. Just wait outside the house.
WILLOW: And we'll bind the spirits long enough for you to get Riley and Buffy out of there.
XANDER: How much time you buying us?
TARA: Could be tricky. We're calling upon the communal spirit of a certain  time and place. (shrugs) I'm more comfortable with dead people.
XANDER: Let's go.
XANDER: What do you feel?
ANYA: Upset. Afraid of being without you. And a little hungry.
XANDER: I mean about the house.
ANYA: Oh. Still haunted.
TARA: Give me your hands. Form a circle. (closes her eyes) Children of the past. Spirits of  Lowell. Be guided by our light. Come forth and be known to us.
GILES: How will we know when it works?
TARA: (wide-eyed but deadpan) We'll know.
XANDER: House is clean.
ANYA: Let's go. (beat) You first.
XANDER: We need to work fast. Never know how long before the munchkins get homesick.
ANYA: Or the human battery conks out.
XANDER: Watch your fingers.
TARA: We implore you. Be still.
GILES: Find it in your hearts to leave our friends passage.
WILLOW: Transform your pain. Release your past. And… uh… get over it.
XANDER: You okay?
TARA: Find here the serenity you seek, the peace you -
GILES: What's happened?
TARA: We lost them.
WILLOW: Xander…
ANYA: Xander!
ANYA: Shut up! Repressed crybabies.
ANYA: Come on…
BUFFY: Xander! Don't you knock?
BUFFY: I just had no idea. It's so creepy… (beat) He was really singing?
XANDER: I'd say it was more like crooning. (to Anya) If we grow old together? Remind me to skip the midlife crisis.
ANYA: Okay.
WILLOW: Come on, you know it was kinda sexy.
XANDER: Please stop saying that. I'm willing to offer cash incentives.
RILEY: We're just lucky no one got injured. No thanks to us.
WILLOW: Don't be too hard on yourself.
BUFFY: He's right, Will. If Riley and I hadn't gotten so… wrapped up in each other … none of this would have happened.
ANYA: True. (to Riley) Feel shame.
XANDER: My girlfriend - mistress of the learning plateau.
WILLOW: Really, it wasn't your fault. You were under the influence of powerful Magicks.
BUFFY: We were like zombies. I had no control over myself at all.
WILLOW: It must've been horrible.
BUFFY: Yes. Horrible.
RILEY: Uh huh.
BUFFY: Yeah.
