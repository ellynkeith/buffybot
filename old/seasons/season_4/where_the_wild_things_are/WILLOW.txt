So what brought these two together?
Huh. Like Martin Luther King. (thinks a moment) But probably a lot less eloquent… and with the… evil… so, different than Martin Luther King. Let's move on.
(hurt, accusing) You have grown-up friends?
(conspiratorially) They're probably going back to -
How many little kids.
Hey Buffy, This might be a good time to mention that someone so not me spilled  something purpley on your new peasant  top that I would never borrow without  asking. You love me?
Nothing.
Horses? Like, big, tall, teeth-that could- take-your-arm-off horses?
I had a bad birthday party pony thing when I was four. I look at horses, I just see really big ponies.
Well, if you promise to look after me…
Tara, what's the matter?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to… (beat) Are you feeling okay?
Tara? It's me.
Tara! Xander!?
Ghost boy, drowning in the tub. I tried to save him but, being a ghost  already… well, I was way too late.
I don't know-
We need Buffy.
Buffy! Riley!?
Buffy! Riley!
Wait! We have to go back!
We'll got to Giles'.
Right. He told us not to come. Said he wanted some grown-up time.
(shock) …Wow…
Now I remember why I used to have such a crush on him.
Come on, it's a little sexy…
It's Buffy.
That's the thing. People all over the party were starting to act weird… sexually.
(avoiding) You know. Ways.
It wasn't always a frat. Look.
(shakes head 'no') Doesn't say. It's really just about the old house director, "Genevieve Holt … Sunnydale Children's Aid… thirty years of community service, giving disadvantaged kids the love and care they deserve."
She didn't.
And we'll bind the spirits long enough for you to get Riley and Buffy out of there.
Transform your pain. Release your past. And… uh… get over it.
Xander…
Come on, you know it was kinda sexy.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Really, it wasn't your fault. You were under the influence of powerful Magicks.
It must've been horrible.
