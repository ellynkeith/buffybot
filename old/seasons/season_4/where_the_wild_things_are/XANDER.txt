Aw, c'mon, big party at Riley's house, gonna be fun. Why don't you want to go?
They don't know you're an ex-demon. And we don't know that they'd care even if they did know you're an ex-demon. Which, by the way, they're not going to find out. Anyway, they'll be too busy flirting with every other girl at the party to even notice you.
I'm just not gonna win here, am I?
What are you talking about? I think you're gorgeous.
Is that what this is about? We've gone other  nights without sex.
Breaking--? We're not! Are we?
Anya, there's a lot more to you and me than the sex. (off her look) Well, there should be. I mean, a  relationship is something you have to work at… work <u>through</u>… together.
There's nothing wrong with my body.
(defensive) Whoa! Hey! All systems go here. No function thing, okay? You want sex?  Let's have sex. Right here, you and me,  big, sweaty, <u>sex</u>.
I don't know. A whole herd of 'em. And  some parents. It was pretty embarrassing, which, welcome to life with Anya.
I'm thinking no. She was pretty mad.  And I'm starting to wonder, is it me?  Am I the crazy one?
It's nothing much, just feeling glad right now that a certain ex-demon doesn't have any powers.

Um. Just, you know, impressing you with my knowledge of local history. Or my knowledge of reading.
You should see me add short columns of small numbers.
Thanks… that is… funny "how  amusing" or funny "back away and avoid eye contact?
Right now I seem to be here with you.
Anya?!
Anya. This is crazy. We had a little fight. that just means we need to work our way through some stuff. It doesn't mean you rebound with the evil undead. And what  have you been doing with him, anyway?
Hey, what a surprise, HOSTILE  SEVENTEEN! Can I get you a drink, HOSTILE SEVENTEEN!?
Anya, what are you doing with him.
You're overreacting. We had a fight. But, see, that's okay. It's normal.
Right. No. Vengeance?
Okay, you know what? You don't deserve to be the one to walk away from this. I've put up with a hell of a lot from you - much of it in the last minute - and if anyone gets to be the one to leave it's me.
Yes. I am.
To enjoy the party.
(called after, angry) I'm having fun already!
Huh. Sometimes I just don't get the sophisticated college lifestyle.
Julie. Okay. This then would be the kissing.
Hi, uh… you okay?
Guys, the girl, Julie, she's freaking out. Anyone friends with Julie?
A ghost? What's the deal, is every frat on this campus haunted? And if so, why do people keep coming to these parties? 'Cause it's not the snacks.
(yelling) Buffy?
BUFFY!!
BUFFY!
Anya, we gotta get out of here. Come on…
Because Buffy and Riley are trapped.
Look around, Anya. There's ghosts and shaking and people going all Felicity with their hair… We're fresh out of  super-people and somebody's got to go back in there. Now who's with me?
You want to bail? Fine. I'm going back in there and I'm not coming out 'til I bring my friend with me.
Um, could we go back to the haunted house? Because this is creeping me out.
Sure, every day the earth rotates backward and the skies turn orange.
What?
I'm fighting total mental  breakdown, here, Will. No more  fuel on the fire, please.
Sorry to step behind the music, but…
Unless they were too busy doing it to answer.
You know, for a god of acoustic rock you're kind of naïve.
(gets it/angry) So you'd hack it off.
Yeah! You smell sin? Well, let me tell you something, lady. She who smelt it, dealt it! (Off Giles' look) It's like what you said, but faster.
(genuinely angry) This totally feeds into my 'old people are creepy' theorem.
So, with Buffy and Riley having, you know, acts of nakedness 'round the clock lately… Maybe they set something free. Like a big bursting poltergasm.
Okay, they're the battery in the boo factory. So, what happens when the battery is drained?
How much time you buying us?
Let's go.
What do you feel?
I mean about the house.
House is clean.
We need to work fast. Never know how long before the munchkins get homesick.
Watch your fingers.
You okay?
I'd say it was more like crooning. (to Anya) If we grow old together? Remind me to skip the midlife crisis.
Please stop saying that. I'm willing to offer cash incentives.
My girlfriend - mistress of the learning plateau.
