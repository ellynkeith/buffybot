What?!
Don't recall ever seeing that before.
Right.
Mm-hmm.
Soon as possible.
First thing. Good plan.
Not "what." Who.
I'll let the squad know as well. They're patrolling; we'll have a reserve unit out during the party.
Tomorrow night. We're having a thing.
(unapologetic) Mine. Boys are pretty ragged. Need to let off steam.
You're welcome to come…
Hey, Buffy, look at the time. Don't you have a class?
Yeah but, you've got that… thing… that…
Gotta run.
Mm-hmm?
Oh, that essay. (to the guys) Catch you guys in a minute. Essay thing.
Was that Willow?
Do you want to go back?
I'm right here.
We're just lucky no one got injured. No thanks to us.
Uh huh.
