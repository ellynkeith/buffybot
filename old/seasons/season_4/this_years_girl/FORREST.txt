You heard the man. At ease.
The shish-kebob that walks like a man.  Looks like you're doing better -- walking  around and threatening people and all that.
Really? Where were you thinking of going?
Don't even tell me you're headed for that girlfriend of yours. Look at  you! One good conjugal visit and  you'll be back in intensive care to stay.
How about you explain it to me, then?
Absolutely. Riley here's just about to  explain why he's leaving us so very quickly.
(ice cold) Things change.
Hey. In case you failed to notice, we  are in a world of hurt around here, and  now is the time for us to band together,  not go flying off our separate ways.
We have a problem, we will deal with  that problem, and you know the most  important thing of the equation right  now is - we keep said problem within  the family.
