Me? Hey, I'm not the one out of place here.
Sounds serious.
What do you need?
This bird after you?
Tell you what I'll do, then. Head out, find this girl, tell her exactly where all of you are, and then watch as she kills you.
Can't anyone in your damned little Scoobie Club at least try to remember that I HATE YOU ALL?!?
And just because I can't do the damage myself doesn't stop me from aiming a loose cannon your way. (beat) And here I thought my evening'd be dull.
Dark hair, this tall, name of Faith, criminally insane - I like this girl already.
