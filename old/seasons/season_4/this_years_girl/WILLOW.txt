Well, why don't we experiment, then? You  know, press some buttons, see what happens.
Are you sure?
Oh. No, blast away, by all means, I only meant… (small) No word about Riley?
Maybe they're telling the truth.
Maybe Giles has a point. Riley is kind of  their top gun guy. It doesn't make sense  that they'd hurt him.
So?
Spread out?
It had to be Adam who killed that thing. But why?
Learning what makes things work.
What's first?
That could be…
They didn't try to stop you?

What'd you tell him?
It's good you guys have such an honest relationship.
That's fair. How'd you handle the Angel-y parts?
Any luck?
At least you're not alone on this. Right now I'll bet every cop in Sunnydale's looking for her.
Look who's talking.
Thanks again for coming with. Hunting a sociopath super-bitch is definitely in the "above and beyond" department.
Run. Flee. Maybe skedaddle. We're not here to engage. This is strictly recon.
What?
Well, technically, Faith's not a monster, and as for fighting? I'd be lucky if I bruise her fist with my face.
What?
Swimming?
Don't worry - we're sure to spot her first. Faith's like some big cleavage-y slutbomb walking around all… (Faith imitation) "Check me out, I'm wicked cool, I'm five-by-five."
That's the thing - no one knows. Buffy can handle Faith. And you're plenty safe with me.
(nods) Then the ritual hiding begins.
