In there.
Yes. And we could run for help while the other three suck your heart out through your neck.
(re: milk carton) Can you open this?
They weren't very organized. If they'd all rushed at Buffy they could've killed her right away.
I did not.
It was a moan.
Nuh-uh. It was like "aaaah."
Xander?
Let's go have sex now.
Xander's not here.
You're not going away. Why aren't you going away?
Oh. (practiced and flat) Please come in, make yourself at home. And so on.
Oh, you're still here. Um... that's nice.
He's Jonathan.
Hey! I was just at the part where he invents the internet!
Oh. Um buck up, you. You kill the best. Go you. Kill kill.
So I can have my book back--
Vengeance wishes on ex-boyfriends. I wish he was a dog, or ugly, or in love with President McKinley or something.
Sure. Alternate realities. You could have, like, a world without shrimp. Or with, you know, nothing but shrimp. You could even make a freaky world where Jonathan's some kind of not- perfect mouth-breather if that's what's blowing your skirt up tonight. Just don't ask me to live there.
Now. If you'll just give me back my book you can be on your way somewhere else.
Yeah. When is Jonathan gonna get here and start the meeting?
Oh. Okay, well, say you really liked shrimp a lot. Or, we could say that you didn't like shrimp at all. "Blah, I wish there weren't any shrimp," you say to yourself--
(amusing herself) Or prawns.
How long do we usually wait for these things?
Yeah. Pretty darn lickable.
Hi. Buffy was just saying how you had a Monster cut up Willow's friend.
That one's not so much fun.
It does feel wrong. Hey. I'm having moral qualms. That's new! (decides) I don't like 'em.
He created the monster.
(matter-of-fact) Jonathan isn't going to want Buffy to get very far.
Doesn't sound very likely, does it?
Alternate realities are neat.
