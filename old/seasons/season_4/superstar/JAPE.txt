Wish you'd get rid of that body. The smell's making me hungry.
Huh. Hey, guess what? There's something new in town. Attacked a girl. Caused a little fuss.
He was there. Jonathan.

Feels okay to me.
Yeah? What makes you so special?
Oh. So what do you do now? You could kill Jonathan. Or you could try, I mean, the guy's a dynamo of action.
