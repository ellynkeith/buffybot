Yeah. A lot stronger. I mean, I'm no Jonathan, but I'm doing okay.
What?
No. They swear they've stopped treating the food, but I'm not taking the chance. I don't know if that means I'll get weaker, or dumber... or smarter.
They still haven't released a full profile on Adam. And we're having zero luck tracking him. I just -- if they'd put a little trust in me I know I could get the job done.
You just need a few pointers.
Sir? How long will it last?
She's not the only one feeling that way. I feel like I should've known. I feel terrible.
I don't know. I mean... I don't know if she's really ever gonna forget it. Every time I try to touch her...
Scared of me?!
What do you mean?
What are you saying. Experienced? Oh God. Does she think I'd... what? That I'd be comparing? She knows she's the one I... I care about.
I think I -- haven't I? She has to know...
They're quite a couple, aren't they?
I wonder if they'll last.
Uh-huh. I haven't really talked much to her friend yet.
Uh-huh.
Buffy, I want you to know--
I just want to say I'm sorry and that it's only you that I want--
You do? Since when?
If you want me to mobilize a squad --
Buffy has something to say. Let's hear what it is. Go ahead.
It sounds like nonsense.
But I'm starting to know this girl pretty well and I think she sees things the rest of us don't. I think -- for once -- we should follow her lead.
Why would Jonathan have the same mark as the Monster?
This does explain everything.
(off book) These spells -- these really work? I mean, can you really "turn your enemies inside out." Or "learn to excrete gold coins"?
I don't know. Buffy seemed pretty sure.
(embarrassed) What... um... what did he have... augmented?
A drawback?
Giles, Buffy and Jonathan are going after this nightmare thing. Are they going to be okay?
So, if this is the world he created, what's the real world like?
But, wait. It only changes back if Buffy kills this thing, right? I mean, if she loses, we could be stuck in this... wrong world forever.
It seemed so real.
Well, the swimsuit calendar's sticking in my mind. (off Buffy's look) Not in a good way.
Did anyone else feel way too tall? I felt way too tall...
Um... we haven't talked at all.
