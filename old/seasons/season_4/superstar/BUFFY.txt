Xander! Anya!
Where's the other one?
(trying to convince herself) A nest. No biggie. I bet 1 could do it. I mean, I know I could take out two...
(disappointed) You're right. There's too many for just us. You know who we need.
Um. Hi? We have a problem...
Thanks for doing this, Jonathan. I wouldn't ask, but--
Ooof. You got me. Very punchy.
And they say no one eats without the TV on anymore.
(working it out) Maybe... maybe we can make that work for us. Stake out the entrance, maybe use a decoy, lure 'em out...
Hope you saved room for being killed.
I should've got that one.
But I let one get by me.
But that's just it. I don't think it was my--
Oh, thanks, Anya. That's not gonna keep me awake all night.
Yeah? You think that up with all the time you spend not being able to bite people?
It's Buffy, you big bleached... (can't find the right word) Stupid guy.
You must be feeling better.
Are you... You're not--
You know, eating the Initiative's technicolor food of strongness.
They're not big with the disclosure, huh?
(seriously) I've felt that way my whole life.
You'd think I could do that. Guess it takes different muscles than, you know, demon beheading.
(nervous) Now, if they made Slaying a competitive sport, that's when I'd have a shot. There could be... you know... speed staking, and, um... figure staking...
I... um... You know what? I don't think this is my game. I've gotta... I've gotta go.
It's all Faith's fault. She's like poison. No, worse, like acid that eats through everything. Or maybe a bomb. The point is, everything's going great with Riley and then she comes along and messes it all up.
Riley?
Oh. But... but he couldn't have known. I mean, you don't just go, "hey, that's not your body. Get out of that body with your hands up."
Maybe I have been blaming him? How do I get past it? What, what if it's too late? What if, after all this, what if he doesn't want me anymore?
But I don't know how to talk to him. How do I; how do I make it okay again?
If it turns into a fistfight, I've got a fifty on Anya.
Riley... I... think... (chickening out) Willow's having a good time.
Tara. She's nice. Kinda shy.
Do we have to have the talk? No talk. More dance.
I know. I know all of that.
Since you put your arms around me.
What happened to you? Can I help?
(to a cop) What's going on? Why are you here?
There's something on these. Maybe she hurt it.
(embarrassed) Oh. It doesn't seem like-- yeah, sorry.
Jonathan?
But it did this time. It might again. We should probably patrol.
No go.
Jonathan did. Said it's some kind of brainless beastie. He's gonna take care of it himself.
I guess. It was a little... I don't know. For a second I thought he looked... like... scared.
Right.
Mmm. It was a really great dance, you know? For the first time I felt like Faith wasn't there. Like no one was there but us.
Willow, what's going on? I got here as fast as I could.
Oh my god.
What happened? What did this?
Tara, what did this?
This? Was it this?
I guess... I guess he made a mistake.
(confused) You're right. He doesn't make mistakes.
Oh.
Well, I kind of wanted to look at some of Xander's stuff...
Can I ask you something? Does it ever seem, I don't know, weird to you that Jonathan is so good at everything?
Anya, he fights better than I do. And I'm the Slayer. The Slayer -- that's supposed to mean something, right?
Actually, not needing the validation. But, thanks. It's just... he's too perfect and... I don't know...
Anya, when you were a demon, you granted wishes, right?
But someone could wish the whole world to be different? That's possible?
Oh.
Here.
I'm just saying it doesn't make sense. He starred in 'The Matrix' but he never left town? And how exactly did he graduate from med school? He's only eighteen years old!
This is the meeting.
Well, I wanted to kind of... see if anyone else thinks Jonathan's, kind of, too perfect.
But see, I'm not sure we can trust our memories. Anya, tell them about the alternate universes.
No, no. She's not saying it right. I just think he did something so he's manipulating the world, and we're all, you know, like pawns.
(frustrated) Stop with the shrimp! I'm trying to do something serious here!
(hurt) But, I'm not --
Okay. The other day, I think I saw him ignore evidence. I think he let Tara get hurt.
No, no...
This Monster has a mark on it. Jonathan saw it and he kind of... blinked.
He knew something about that Monster. He was reacting to the mark-- Wait.
I remember something. Giles, do you have a Jonathan Swimsuit Calendar?
(quickly) No. No. Wow. No. There!
(shaken) I don't know... But Jonathan is definitely keeping --
(caught) Jonathan!
No. It's just, the mark. You said it was safe and it wasn't. (backing off) I'm sorry. I just don't understand.
Jonathan. Let's go after the Monster right now. You and me.
We can try.
Shut up, Spike.
Spike, you're relying on butcher's blood right now, aren't you?
Just that the butchers in this town respect Jonathan's reputation. If they do him a favor you might get pretty thirsty.
Wow. Look at that. Fall down there and be dead for a while.
(relieved) Jonathan! What do we do?
What? But I -- how?
What? Lose your what?
Oh.
I remember this. This is good.
In that world it was real.
Poor Xander, I guess he hurt you most of all.
Right. After Tara, of course.
Yeah.
Why'd you do it anyway? No, I get why. How did you do it?
Jonathan, you get why they're mad, right? Not just the Monster. People didn't like being, you know, the actors in your little sock puppet theater.
Jonathan, you can't keep trying to make everything work out all at once, with some huge gesture. Things are complicated. They take time and work.
Um... Watch out for southpaws?
I remember.
I'm glad we talked this all out.
Well, whatever we're doing? We're doing it great.
Oh, Jonathan...
