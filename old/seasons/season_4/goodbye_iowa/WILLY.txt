Aw man. You're killing me here.
Yeah, you know... I'm making some changes with my life. Getting  away from my old image.
Uh huh. I know you're gonna think I'm blowing smoke - but after those apocalypse demons nearly did me in, I had an experience of the spiritual variety -
See - that's the thing. I don't talk behind people's backs no more. (indicates the sign) And I'm trying to give the joint some class. It's Willy's "place" now, see? Brings in a better clientele.
(conspiratorially) Just once, and it don't have to hurt -  just make it look good.
Okay, sorry, sorry. Go again. (loudly/dramatic) No! I can't talk to -
(still in pain) Heard there was one around a week or two back. Word was you got him, you and those army guys.
Yeah. Far as I know he's been off the streets.
I've heard stuff. Mostly stories, you know.
Just cooling her dogs like the rest of  us. Now why don't you relax - 
No kidding, let me get you some chicken fingers on the house -
I'm just saying - 
Hey! We got new rules in here, no killing -
Got ya.
