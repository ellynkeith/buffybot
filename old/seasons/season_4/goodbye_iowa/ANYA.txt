So - you were getting too close to something.
(unenthusiastic) Yes. Come boogie.
It didn't work, but they're all upset anyway. 
Every time you moved you made squeaky noises. It was irritating.
Sorry.
And after you went through all that  stuff with Angel... (then) You should get a boring boyfriend, like Xander. (beat) But you can't have Xander.
So dump him. But you can't have Xander. 
I hate that part.
You think Professor Walsh did something to him?
(alarmed, to Buffy) Hey, remember before? No Xander. Not in a boyfriend-way or a lead- him-to-certain-death-way.
It's not like he was in "the Nam." He was G.I. Joe for one night.
(meekly) Can't you find another way to help these guys, like Xerox the handouts  or something?
Also - Polgaras have to eat about every two hours. Factor in the low I.Q. - and you've got a demon who's not very low profile.
