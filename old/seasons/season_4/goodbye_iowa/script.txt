BUFFY: (mid-explanation) ...so Maggie sends me down into the sewers with one of those blasto guns. Next thing I know, it's raining monsters.
XANDER: Hallelujah. (off their looks) What? She was asking for it.
BUFFY: (ignoring) And this <u>gate</u> slams down behind me... and I try to use the gun, but it goes, pffft! 
GILES: You're saying Maggie set you up?
BUFFY: That's what I'm saying. She sent  me on a one-way recon. 
SPIKE: Got to hand it to you, Goldilocks, you have bleedin' tragic taste in men. I have a cousin, married a regurgitating Frovlax demon, has better instincts than you.
BUFFY: What does my taste in men have to  do with this? 
SPIKE: You think Riley was off knitting booties for your future offspring while Maggie was stringing you up?
BUFFY: Riley? You think that he had  something to do with this?
GILES: Probably not. But we'd be remiss if we didn't think through all the possibilities.
BUFFY: (shaken) Right... Remiss. (then) I - no... I mean, no. Maggie made sure he was nowhere around when she handed out the very special "make Buffy dead" assignment.
WILLOW: Plus, Riley - he seems like he  wouldn't tell a white lie, let  alone a whole lot of big, fat dirty ones.
XANDER: That's why they call them "secret"  forces, Will. 'Cause they kind of keep the whole lying thing to themselves.
BUFFY: (back on topic) All I know is that Maggie has it in for me. And that means The Initiative has it in for me.
WILLOW: Scary, on so many levels. 
XANDER: Right. I'm guessing the mad scientist isn't too keen on the fact that the entire Scooby Gang knows The Initiative is up to no good.
BUFFY: Getting us back to the "not safe for any of us" concept.
GILES: I still don't understand, Buffy. What happened that would make  Maggie want to kill you?
BUFFY: I don't know. She didn't dig the fact that I was asking a lot of questions, that's for sure.
ANYA: So - you were getting too close to something.
GILES: (gravely) Clearly. I can only imagine what she  was so desperate to hide.
BUFFY: Everybody grab a weapon. We've got to move.
XANDER: (pumping himself up) And storm the Initiative? Yeah... Let's take on those suckers!
BUFFY: I was more thinking that we'd hide.
XANDER: (relaxes) Oh thank god.
BUFFY: We need to relocate to someplace we're less likely to be found. Come up with a plan.
WILLOW: We could go to my house.
BUFFY: (shakes her head) The Initiative guys know how close we are. They'll automatically check the places you hang out. (then) Xander - what about your basement? The guys haven't seen us together much. And your basement's big enough -
WILLOW: Plus - mirror ball.
XANDER: Cool. Come on down and boogie at Xander's hide-away.
ANYA: (unenthusiastic) Yes. Come boogie.
GILES: Absolutely not. I will not squat in that dank little hole.
SPIKE: What? It was good enough for me, but you're above it all?
GILES: Precisely. Besides, I don't see why we can't stay right where we are. I doubt very much that those Initiative boys are going to come  around here looking for --
RILEY: Buffy.
BUFFY: You know?
RILEY: I know something went down. Tell me.
BUFFY: Maggie - she tried to kill me
ANYA: It didn't work, but they're all upset anyway. 
RILEY: Okay. Listen. I need you to go over  everything. Step by step. There must  be some kind of mistake - 
XANDER: (hard) There's no mistake. And how do  you know something happened? Where were you?
RILEY: I was on a mission, but I came back and... I - I'm not sure. Let's just, keep our heads. Not jump to any -
BUFFY: What?
RILEY: That's Hostile 17.
SPIKE: (bad American accent) No, I'm just a friend of Xander's... (drop accent) Bugger it. I'm your guy.
BUFFY: That's - his name is Spike. It's a... really long story. But he's  not bad anymore.
SPIKE: Hey! What am I? A bleedin' broken record? I'm <u>bad</u>. (to Riley) It's just, I can't bite anymore, thanks to you wankers.
RILEY: We've been looking all over the place and you've known where he was all along?
BUFFY: It's not like that. 
RILEY: Then what is it like? What's he doing here?
SPIKE: (heads for the door) Leaving you swabs to your dramatics, thanks. Got my stories on the telly for that. (to Riley) By the by, if you are trying to  kill her --
RILEY: (spun) Buffy - what is this? You're hiding  an HST?
XANDER: Maybe you should back off and let her ask the questions, Jack. Your boss just tried to make monster food out of her.
RILEY: I didn't see much. I wasn't there... (to Buffy) All I know is, Professor Walsh told me you were dead. But then I saw you on the monitors...
GILES: We think Buffy was becoming too inquisitive. That she may have been getting close to something Dr. Walsh was trying to hide. Any idea what that might be?
BUFFY: What about 314? Maybe that's it -
RILEY: (to Buffy) Maybe she was trying to test you? What if it was only a drill -
BUFFY: Then why did she tell you I was dead? Riley - this was no test -
GILES: I've heard rumors. That The Initiative isn't what we've been told. That, secretly, they are working toward some darker  purpose... Something that might harm us all -
RILEY: No. That's - that's not what happens there.
BUFFY: Riley - 
RILEY: You have no right... I mean, I think I would know if...
RILEY: I - I can't be here. I'll sort it out on  my own.
BUFFY: Riley - 
RILEY: <u>No</u>. Just - I'm sorry.
ADAM: What am I?
BOY: You're a monster.
BOY: Me? I'm a boy.
ADAM: How do you work?
BOY: (stupid question) I don't know. I just do.
ANGLEMAN: Dr. Walsh? 
BUFFY: (in all seriousness) That would never happen.
WILLOW: Well, no, Buff. That's why they call them cartoons and not documentaries...
GILES: Must we have the noise? My head is splitting.
WILLOW: Look who's a cranky bear in the morning.
GILES: Yes. Can't imagine why I didn't sleep well in my beachball.
ANYA: Every time you moved you made squeaky noises. It was irritating.
GILES: Really? I'm surprised you could hear it over your Wagnerian snoring. 
BUFFY: Could we - not? Everything's screwed up enough without you two doing scenes from my parents' marriage.
ANYA: Sorry.
BUFFY: Thank you.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) It'll be okay. Riley's just confused,  that's all.
BUFFY: I don't know. Seems like things could get heavier. I mean, his world's falling apart.
ANYA: And after you went through all that  stuff with Angel... (then) You should get a boring boyfriend, like Xander. (beat) But you can't have Xander.
BUFFY: That was the idea. Riley was  supposed to be Mr. Joe Guy. We were supposed to do dumb stuff - like hold hands through the daisies going, "tra, la, la..."
WILLOW: (sincere) Poor Buffy. Your life resists all things average.
ANYA: So dump him. But you can't have Xander. 
BUFFY: I'll try to remember that. Anyway,  it's too late. I'm already at the "I hurt  when he hurts, I smile when he smiles" stage.
ANYA: I hate that part.
BUFFY: So - I just have to make it work.
WILLOW: (encouraging) I bet you will.
BUFFY: No. No bet. I will <u>make</u> it work.
XANDER: Turn on the TV. Now.
REPORTER: ... Sunnydale is still reeling from news of the crime. A source in the Coroner's Office tells us that the boy was stabbed by what looks like some kind of large skewer, and his body was then mutilated. Police have not named a suspect, and the killer is still at large...
BUFFY: The Polgara demon had a skewer in his arm. That was the one Maggie specifically wanted us to bring back alive.
GILES: She must have set it after you.
WILLOW: Buffy. It's not your fault. How could you know?
GILES: She's right. You mustn't blame yourself.
BUFFY: I'm not going to. I'm going to the crime scene and see what I can find out. You guys research the Polgara demon - I want to know where it is. And when I find it - I'm going to make him pay for taking that kid's life. I'll make him die in ways he can't even imagine.
FORREST: Hey - where you been all night? (off his silence) Well, congratulations. I see you and Buffy have finally gotten past the shy phase.
RILEY: I wasn't with Buffy. I needed to be alone. Think things through.
FORREST: What things?
FORREST: This is mighty ominous. What's up, man?
RILEY: Professor Walsh tried to have  Buffy killed.
FORREST: What? (then/skeptical) Did Buffy tell you that? I mean, do you have any proof?
RILEY: I saw enough to know it's true.
FORREST: I don't get it. Why?
RILEY: Buffy thinks that she was getting too close to something. That Professor Walsh has some secret - 
FORREST: (considers/then) I wouldn't put it past Buffy to get on Professor Walsh's bad side. She tends to put her nose where it doesn't belong.
RILEY: What?
FORREST: She's a pain, always wanting to know why this, and why that - 
RILEY: And you're saying she should die because of that?
FORREST: I don't know. Maybe Professor  Walsh found out that Buffy was up to something bad. That ever cross  your mind?
RILEY: (angered) Why does it bug you so much that I'm hanging with her? Is it 'cause she's a better soldier than you?
FORREST: It bugs me that she's using you to infiltrate our operation.
RILEY: You're saying she's a spy or  something? You're crazy.
FORREST: Riley, think about it! The Professor's not stupid. If she tried to kill Buffy - maybe Buffy needed killing.
GRAHAM: Guys...
RILEY: (sternly) Not now, private.
FORREST: What is it?
GRAHAM: Professor Walsh is dead. 
FORREST: Look at that wound. She's been staked, wouldn't you say brother?
RILEY: What?
FORREST: Only one person I can think of who could do something like that.
RILEY: You better not be saying what I  think you're saying. We don't  know a person did this. A Polgara demon has -
FORREST: No way, man. That's your girlfriend's M.O.
RILEY: Serious accusation. You better be ready to deal with the consequences -
FORREST: Bring 'em on. That supernatural freak is blinding you and I'm sick of it!
RILEY: That's enough -
ANGLEMAN: Stand back, men. Show some respect.
RILEY: No sir.
ANGLEMAN: Alright, good. Now, Washington is sending in a team to do an  internal investigation. I've been told we have to wait for  word - 
RILEY: What do you mean - wait? This has to be the work of the Polgara demon we captured last week - 
ANGLEMAN: Probably. It looks like, last night,  the Polgara escaped through tunnel 72.
RILEY: It's out loose somewhere?
ANGLEMAN: I'm afraid so.
RILEY: Then we have to go after it.
ANGLEMAN: My orders from Washington are for a total lock-down until they arrive. I'm sorry. (then) Now return to your quarters. There's nothing you can do here.
RILEY: Listen. Angelman can talk all he wants - but I'm still in charge until the brass gets here and tells me otherwise. And I say  we've got a demon to hunt. (firmly) Now suit up for armed patrol. And by that I mean loaded guns, men. Target practice is over - we're  going for blood.
BUFFY: Hey.
RILEY: Hey.
BUFFY: Look - I'm sorry about earlier. I know everyone came on pretty strong, and the Spike thing - it isn't as totally tweaked as it looks. (off his silence) Okay - maybe it is - but there's an  explanation that almost makes sense...
RILEY: (hard) Maggie's dead.
BUFFY: Happy? How can you say that? Of course I'm not. What happened? Who killed her?
RILEY: That's classified.
BUFFY: Classified? Riley - (holding it together) The Polgara. It got her - then it escaped. (nothing from him) Didn't it?
WILLOW: Howdy.
TARA: I just got your message a minute  ago - I was in class. But I was about to call you.
WILLOW: I had so much fun the other night. Those spells...
TARA: Yeah, that was nice.
WILLOW: (awkward) I hope you don't think I just come over for the spells and everything. I mean, I really like just talking and hanging out with you and stuff.
TARA: I know that. (then/smiling) But you want to do a spell.
WILLOW: (sheepishly) Yeah. But only because it's really  important. There's this - 
TARA: (gently interrupting) You don't have to explain. I don't  mind. Really. (shyly) I've been thinking about that last spell we did all day.
WILLOW: (pleased) You have? Oh. (then/excited) This one should be fun too. We  conjure the Goddess Thespia to help us locate the demonic energy in the area. Shouldn't be too tricky.
TARA: The Goddess Thespia? Are you sure we're ready for that?
WILLOW: (mock scoffing) You and me? This is beneath us.
TARA: Okay. If you say so. 
GRAHAM: What do you think? A homeless guy? 
FORREST: Could be. Or a squatter of the  demon variety.
GRAHAM: But not the Polgara.
FORREST: Who cares. I see a demon, it dies.
GRAHAM: Warm.
FORREST: (frustrated) Damn!
WILLY: Aw man. You're killing me here.
BUFFY: I missed you too. Joint's jumping.
WILLY: Yeah, you know... I'm making some changes with my life. Getting  away from my old image.
BUFFY: What, you mean, as a double dealing snitch?
WILLY: Uh huh. I know you're gonna think I'm blowing smoke - but after those apocalypse demons nearly did me in, I had an experience of the spiritual variety -
BUFFY: That's swell, really, but I still need to know if you've heard  anything about a Polgara demon doing some killing over the last few days.
WILLY: See - that's the thing. I don't talk behind people's backs no more. (indicates the sign) And I'm trying to give the joint some class. It's Willy's "place" now, see? Brings in a better clientele.
BUFFY: I'm going to have to punch you, aren't I?
WILLY: (conspiratorially) Just once, and it don't have to hurt -  just make it look good.
BUFFY: (sotto) Not yet. I didn't touch you -
WILLY: Okay, sorry, sorry. Go again. (loudly/dramatic) No! I can't talk to -
BUFFY: The Polgara. What do you know?
WILLY: (still in pain) Heard there was one around a week or two back. Word was you got him, you and those army guys.
BUFFY: And that was the last you heard.
WILLY: Yeah. Far as I know he's been off the streets.
BUFFY: What about those "army" guys? What's the talk about them? Anybody mentioned something called 314?
WILLY: I've heard stuff. Mostly stories, you know.
BUFFY: What are you doing? Following me?
RILEY: You told me you were tracking the Polgara demon. I was going to help you. (angrily) But now I see you're not hunting demons - you're socializing with them. Again. I thought you were supposed to be killing these guys, not buying them drinks. 
BUFFY: Smooth, Officer Riley. They teach you those undercover moves in special forces?
RILEY: I'm serious, Buffy. What are you doing here?
WILLY: Just cooling her dogs like the rest of  us. Now why don't you relax - 
RILEY: (ignoring/to Buffy) I want you to tell me. Who are you, really?
WILLY: No kidding, let me get you some chicken fingers on the house -
RILEY: (to Willy/hard) Hey. Think you could shut up?
WILLY: I'm just saying - 
RILEY: I said shut up. Or maybe you'd like to go back to the lab with me.  I'm sure the coats would love to  classify a - whatever you are.
BUFFY: Leave him. He's human - (then) Riley, you're shaking - 
RILEY: So - he's human. He just harbors demons.. Which makes him a good guy like you?
BUFFY: You have the truth. You're just too screwed up to see it now  because of what happened to Professor Walsh. Now let me go -
RILEY: Hold it - you!
WILLY: Hey! We got new rules in here, no killing -
RILEY: Right. Except - it seems like the rules don't apply much these days,do they? (to lady) Like, if I shot you right now, I don't  know if I'd have a corpse on my hands  or one pissed off vampire -
BUFFY: Riley - 
RILEY: (ignoring) I mean, who do you believe? First it sounds like lies. Then it sounds  like truth...
BUFFY: Riley, no.
RILEY: What's happening to me?
BUFFY: Why don't you lie down? You'll be more comfortable.
RILEY: I - I can't. It's like... something's  crawling inside...
BUFFY: (alarmed) No. You're hurting yourself. Come on -
RILEY: I thought I knew. But I don't... I don't  know anything.
BUFFY: Shhhh. You're sick. Once you get some rest -
RILEY: No. I don't know anything. I don't  know which team I'm on. Who the bad guys are...
BUFFY: Riley -
RILEY: Maybe I'm the bad guy. (then) Maybe I'm the thing you should kill.
BUFFY: No. Don't even think that. (then) Now listen to me. You just need to  get some sleep. Come on, lie down.
GILES: How is he?
BUFFY: This isn't just grief making him act  this way. Something's affecting him  physically - and it's getting worse.
ANYA: You think Professor Walsh did something to him?
BUFFY: I don't know. But I'm ready to  find out.
XANDER: That's going to be tough, what with Maggie's deadness and all.
BUFFY: She must have kept records somewhere. About Riley and 314 and all of it. And I doubt she was  the only person at the Initiative who  knew what she was up to.
XANDER: So what's the plan?
BUFFY: Giles and Anya will keep researching.  Xander, you and I will go in undercover.
ANYA: (alarmed, to Buffy) Hey, remember before? No Xander. Not in a boyfriend-way or a lead- him-to-certain-death-way.
BUFFY: He's the only one with military experience.
ANYA: It's not like he was in "the Nam." He was G.I. Joe for one night.
XANDER: It's okay, Anya. I've backed Buffy  up before.
ANYA: (meekly) Can't you find another way to help these guys, like Xerox the handouts  or something?
XANDER: I'll be careful, promise.
GILES: (back on topic) How do you plan on getting inside The Initiative, Buffy? Surely their security system is almost impenetrable.
BUFFY: I have my clearance. I'm hoping Maggie never had time to revoke it.
GILES: As for the whereabouts of the Polgara demon, Buffy, I'm afraid we haven't turned up much. There's  been no report of him since his capture.
BUFFY: Then we'll just have to keep looking.
TARA: (re: square on floor) So this square is Sunnydale?
WILLOW: (smiles) Right. It's like a map. We each take different parts of the potion -  and when we do the incantation,  we blow it onto the square at the  exact same time.
TARA: But how does it work?
WILLOW: That's the cool part. When the potion  mixes and Thespia is called, it  creates a mist over the parts where  the demons are. It even makes  different colors for different breeds.
TARA: Wow.
WILLOW: You ready?
TARA: Thespia, we walk in shadow, walk in blindness. You are the protector  of the night.
WILLOW: Thespia, goddess, ruler of all darkness - we implore you - open a window to the world of the underbeing.
XANDER: Things seem quiet.
BUFFY: Usually are this time of -
XANDER: Buff, maybe you should check the look later.
BUFFY: Shhh. Just -
XANDER: Ow! What was that for?
BUFFY: Sorry. It's just - I'm the only one who can pass the retinal scan.
XANDER: The - eeeew! I don't want to see that!
BUFFY: Retinal scan, Xander. (tense) In a few seconds we'll find out if my clearance is still good.
XANDER: Or if we're about to die at the hands  of fifty grief-fueled military goons...
XANDER: Holy moly.
BUFFY: I know.
XANDER: I totally get it now. Can I have sex  with Riley too?
XANDER: Well, I... You know, I just...in the  movies, the guy and the girl have  to hide -
BUFFY: Please. Do you think we could draw  more attention to ourselves?
XANDER: Well, hey. Maybe that's what's wrong with the world. Ever think about that?
WILLOW: It wasn't even like the spell went wrong. It just - wouldn't.
GILES: Well, if it makes you feel better, we didn't fare much better here.
WILLOW: Really? Is Riley okay?
GILES: He's asleep, finally, but he doesn't  look good... And the research has  been troubling as well. This demon  we're dealing with seems highly  atypical for a Polgara. The child it  killed was mutilated, and there's no  recorded case of a Polgara ever doing  such a thing.
ANYA: Also - Polgaras have to eat about every two hours. Factor in the low I.Q. - and you've got a demon who's not very low profile.
WILLOW: So - how has he been hiding in Sunnydale for the last two days without anybody seeing him?
GILES: Exactly -
WILLOW: Oh! God, you -
RILEY: Where's Buffy?
WILLOW: She went out. Can I get you something?
RILEY: Just tell me where she is.
GILES: You're not well, Riley. You need to rest.
RILEY: Did she find the Polgara? Is that it?
GILES: No. We're still looking, but -
RILEY: But what?
WILLOW: She went to find out what's making you sick, Riley.
RILEY: I'm not sick. You're telling me she  went to the Initiative?
WILLOW: She's just trying to help you -
RILEY: She doesn't belong there.
WILLOW: Riley, listen -
RILEY: Stand away from the stairs.
WILLOW: No. You're going to get her killed  if you -
ANGLEMAN: How many of the men are still out? The longer they go without their meds -
ANGLEMAN: It's dangerous. I don't want to think  about the damage our guys could do  under the stress of withdrawal,  especially since they won't understand  what's happening to them -
ANGLEMAN: But Finn wasn't one of them, right?
ANGLEMAN: Find him. He's the one I care about.  He's too important to the work to lose now.
SPIKE: Double shot of O' Neg, 'keep. An' make it the good stuff, I don't want no freakin' orangutan.
WILLY: Got ya.
SPIKE: Been a pisser of a day, ain't it? Those army blokes are on a tear. Ran me outta my place and all over town...
BUFFY: You know, I don't generally like to kill  humans - but I've learned it pays to be  flexible in life.
ANGLEMAN: I was wondering when you'd turn up.
BUFFY: (mock disappointment) Oh - darn - so this wasn't a surprise. (deadly) I want you to tell me what you did to  Riley. And after that, we can take a  tour of room 314.
ANGLEMAN: Somebody's coming, you know. I'm  sure they've already seen you on the security monitors -
RILEY: (cold) Monitors are non-functional at this time, sir. (stares hard at Buffy) Went down about ten minutes ago.
BUFFY: What? I didn't -
XANDER: (interrupting) Thank God for small favors and worry about the details later, huh Buff?
ANGLEMAN: Finn. Take this girl to the stockade,  immediately!
BUFFY: Riley - he can tell us what we need  to know.
ANGLEMAN: She did. (quickly) But understand, the Initiative has no  interest in eliminating the slayer. It  was her own vendetta -
BUFFY: Why? Spell it out for me. I feel an  attack of dumb blonde coming on.
ANGLEMAN: I don't know -
BUFFY: (tightening her grip) Think harder.
ANGLEMAN: It was the -- project.
BUFFY: Project? 314?
ANGLEMAN: It - it escaped -
RILEY: (interrupting/to Angleman) That's enough. You're making her sound like some psychopath. She  wasn't like that. She was a  brilliant woman -
ANGLEMAN: She was. It's not -
RILEY: All she was trying to do was help people - and this is how you want them to remember her?
BUFFY: Riley. Listen - I heard Angleman say that she was feeding you drugs -
RILEY: No! You're doing this to me, aren't  you? This all started because of you.
BUFFY: If you'll just listen. All I'm trying to  do is help you get to the truth -
RILEY: You want truth? Then tell me! What did you do to her, Buffy?!
BUFFY: Stop it! I didn't do anything!
ADAM: (simply) Me.
ADAM: I've been thinking... About the world.  I wanted to see it. Learn it. I saw the  inside of that boy, and it was  beautiful, but it didn't tell me about  the world. It just made me feel. So  now I want to know about me. Why  I feel. What I am.
ANGLEMAN: Adam. Maggie would want you to stand down.
ADAM: Yes. But I seem to have a design flaw.
ANGLEMAN: (softly) Oh God...
ADAM: In addition to organic material, I'm  equipped with GP2D11 infrared  detectors, 140 MWS, microspec 4000 sensors, a harmonic decelerator plus DC servo...
BUFFY: She pieced you together out of parts  of other demons.
ADAM: And man. And machine. Which tells  me what I am, but not who I am... (then) Mother wrote things down. Hard data, but also her... feelings. That's  how I learned I have... a job here.  And that she loved me.
RILEY: (disgusted) She wasn't your mother - and she didn't love you.
XANDER: Is that really the issue?
RILEY: She made you because she was a scientist.
BUFFY: Riley...
ADAM: Riley Finn...
RILEY: Stop. Those files -
ADAM: (cutting him off/interested) Oh. Mother created you too.
RILEY: Maggie's not my mother. I have a  mother. A real -
ADAM: A birth mother. But after you met Maggie, she was the one who shaped your basic operating system. She taught you how to think, how to  feel. She fed you chemicals to make  you stronger, your mind and body...  She said that you and I were her  favorite children, her art. That  makes us brothers... family.
RILEY: No. I am not like you.
ADAM: That's pain, isn't it? Why? Because  your feeding schedule, the chemicals,  have been interrupted? Or do you miss  her? Tell me -
RILEY: (reaching his limit) I'll kill you.
ADAM: You won't. You haven't been programmed to.
RILEY: (desperate) I can not be programmed. I'm a man.
ADAM: It's here. The plan she had for us.  What happens. How it ends.
RILEY: No...
ADAM: Do you want to hear?
RILEY: No!
BUFFY: Riley!
ANGLEMAN: Doctor...
ADAM: Thank you. This was interesting.
BUFFY: Riley. Are you -
XANDER: You got a demon in here. It escaped  through that vent.
BUFFY: It's not the Polgara. It kind of looks  like a man -
FORREST: (disbelieving) Right, and you just happened to be in the neighborhood.
RILEY: (with difficulty) She's telling the truth. I saw it. It  killed Angleman. (to the men) Go. Now.
BUFFY: He needs a hospital.
FORREST: We'll take it from here.
BUFFY: No. I'm going with him -
FORREST: It's a military hospital -
BUFFY: But -
FORREST: Back off. We take care of our own around here, understand?
XANDER: Buffy...
RILEY: Buffy?
FORREST: (to Graham) Escort her out.
GRAHAM: Let's go -
RILEY: No... Buffy -
BUFFY: Riley...
DEMON: What did you expect, Spike? A  welcome party? Word's out - you've  been making war on the demon world.
SPIKE: (pained) War?
DEMON: With the slayer. You kill other demons, and the rest of us don't hold with that. Still, if I see you  around here again I'll be inclined to break that code. Do you understand?
WILLOW: ...no word from Riley?
BUFFY: Nothing. The Initiative probably has him locked in a medical ward...  And I can't get near him - not until  I have a better plan than storming  in there and getting us all shot.
WILLOW: Yeah. You might want to work the kinks out of that one.
BUFFY: What am I going to do? He needs help - and I'm shut out.
WILLOW: You'll find a way.
BUFFY: But it's not like I can spend all my  energy going after The Initiative  now. Not while Adam's out there.
WILLOW: He's that big a threat?
BUFFY: I could barely fight him. It sounded  like Maggie designed him to be the  ultimate warrior. He's smart, and fast...  He gave the commando guys the slip  with no problem.
WILLOW: (also shaken) There's got to be a flaw...
