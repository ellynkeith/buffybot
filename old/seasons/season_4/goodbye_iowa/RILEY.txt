Buffy.
I know something went down. Tell me.
Okay. Listen. I need you to go over  everything. Step by step. There must  be some kind of mistake - 
I was on a mission, but I came back and... I - I'm not sure. Let's just, keep our heads. Not jump to any -
That's Hostile 17.
We've been looking all over the place and you've known where he was all along?
Then what is it like? What's he doing here?
(spun) Buffy - what is this? You're hiding  an HST?
I didn't see much. I wasn't there... (to Buffy) All I know is, Professor Walsh told me you were dead. But then I saw you on the monitors...
(to Buffy) Maybe she was trying to test you? What if it was only a drill -
No. That's - that's not what happens there.
You have no right... I mean, I think I would know if...
I - I can't be here. I'll sort it out on  my own.
<u>No</u>. Just - I'm sorry.
I wasn't with Buffy. I needed to be alone. Think things through.
Professor Walsh tried to have  Buffy killed.
I saw enough to know it's true.
Buffy thinks that she was getting too close to something. That Professor Walsh has some secret - 
What?
And you're saying she should die because of that?
(angered) Why does it bug you so much that I'm hanging with her? Is it 'cause she's a better soldier than you?
You're saying she's a spy or  something? You're crazy.
(sternly) Not now, private.
What?
You better not be saying what I  think you're saying. We don't  know a person did this. A Polgara demon has -
Serious accusation. You better be ready to deal with the consequences -
That's enough -
No sir.
What do you mean - wait? This has to be the work of the Polgara demon we captured last week - 
It's out loose somewhere?
Then we have to go after it.
Listen. Angelman can talk all he wants - but I'm still in charge until the brass gets here and tells me otherwise. And I say  we've got a demon to hunt. (firmly) Now suit up for armed patrol. And by that I mean loaded guns, men. Target practice is over - we're  going for blood.
Hey.
(hard) Maggie's dead.
That's classified.
You told me you were tracking the Polgara demon. I was going to help you. (angrily) But now I see you're not hunting demons - you're socializing with them. Again. I thought you were supposed to be killing these guys, not buying them drinks. 
I'm serious, Buffy. What are you doing here?
(ignoring/to Buffy) I want you to tell me. Who are you, really?
(to Willy/hard) Hey. Think you could shut up?
I said shut up. Or maybe you'd like to go back to the lab with me.  I'm sure the coats would love to  classify a - whatever you are.
So - he's human. He just harbors demons.. Which makes him a good guy like you?
Hold it - you!
Right. Except - it seems like the rules don't apply much these days,do they? (to lady) Like, if I shot you right now, I don't  know if I'd have a corpse on my hands  or one pissed off vampire -
(ignoring) I mean, who do you believe? First it sounds like lies. Then it sounds  like truth...
What's happening to me?
I - I can't. It's like... something's  crawling inside...
I thought I knew. But I don't... I don't  know anything.
No. I don't know anything. I don't  know which team I'm on. Who the bad guys are...
Maybe I'm the bad guy. (then) Maybe I'm the thing you should kill.
Where's Buffy?
Just tell me where she is.
Did she find the Polgara? Is that it?
But what?
I'm not sick. You're telling me she  went to the Initiative?
She doesn't belong there.
Stand away from the stairs.
(cold) Monitors are non-functional at this time, sir. (stares hard at Buffy) Went down about ten minutes ago.
(interrupting/to Angleman) That's enough. You're making her sound like some psychopath. She  wasn't like that. She was a  brilliant woman -
All she was trying to do was help people - and this is how you want them to remember her?
No! You're doing this to me, aren't  you? This all started because of you.
You want truth? Then tell me! What did you do to her, Buffy?!
(disgusted) She wasn't your mother - and she didn't love you.
She made you because she was a scientist.
Stop. Those files -
Maggie's not my mother. I have a  mother. A real -
No. I am not like you.
(reaching his limit) I'll kill you.
(desperate) I can not be programmed. I'm a man.
No...
No!
(with difficulty) She's telling the truth. I saw it. It  killed Angleman. (to the men) Go. Now.
Buffy?
No... Buffy -
