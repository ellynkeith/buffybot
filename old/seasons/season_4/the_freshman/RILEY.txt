I'm okay. It's okay.
Let me give you a hand.
Well, you'll have a lot of fun. Professor  Walsh, she's quite a character.
I'm a T.A. I'll be helping the professor  out. I'm sorry, I've forgotten my manners  in all the concussion. I'm Riley.
It's nice to meet you both.
Absolutely. You know her treatise on  Dietrick's work?
It's not on the syllabus but it's a fascinating  read, if you're into that sort of thing.  They have it here.
I'll show you.
If you're looking for psych, it's through here.
Sorry?
Oh, no, sure I remember you. You're  Willow's friend.
My head's fine. It just stung for a bit  and I lost most of my basic motor  functions. No biggy.
Right. Have fun.
It's not on her lesson plan...
