Oh! Are you Buffy?
Kathy.
Yeah.
I was surprised, 'cause you hear horror  stories about freshman housing. You  took the right side.
No no, I just wanted to make sure  that was what you wanted. Are  you excited for classes tomorrow?
I bet there's a lot of parties to go to  this week, too. Not that I'm a crazy  partier - and I'm not always this hyper,  either. I'm just excited.
I'm really glad they put me with  someone cool. I can tell you're cool.  I just know this whole year is gonna  be superfun!
It seemed kind of weird.
Does Buffy have a history of emotional  problems? 'Cause on my request form  I was pretty specific about a <b>stable</b>  non-smoker.
No.
Little bit.
Kathy.
You too. Stop by sometime.
