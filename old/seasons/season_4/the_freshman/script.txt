BUFFY: Anything?
WILLOW: Ah! Introduction to the Modern Novel.  "A survey study of twentieth century  novelists...", open to freshmen...  You might like that...
BUFFY: Introduction to the Modern Novel.  I'm guess I'd probably have to <b>read</b>  the modern novel.
WILLOW: Maybe more than one.
BUFFY: I like books, I just don't wanna take  on too much. Do they have an  Introduction to the Modern Blurb?
WILLOW: Ooh! Short story.
BUFFY: That's good.
WILLOW: Oh, no, it conflicts. With Psych.
BUFFY: Maybe I shouldn't take Psych.
WILLOW: Oh, you gotta! It's fun, and you can  use it for your science requirement.  Anyway Professor Walsh is supposed  to be great, she's like world renowned.
BUFFY: How do you get renowned? Do you  have to be nowned first?
WILLOW: (still reading) Yes, first there is the painful nowning  process - wait. "Images of Pop Culture".  This is good. They watch movies, shows,  even commercials.
BUFFY: For credit?
WILLOW: Isn't college cool?
BUFFY: How did I miss that one?
WILLOW: Well, you did sort of leave your  course selection to the last minute.
BUFFY: Sorry, Miss "I chose my major in  playgroup."
WILLOW: (nose in the air) That's an exaggeration. I just think,  you know, it's fun to be prepared.  You don't wanna be caught unawares.
BUFFY: I've been busy, you know? It's been  a slay-heavy summer. I haven't had a  lot of time to think about life at UC  Sunnydale.
WILLOW: It's exciting, though, huh?
BUFFY: Yeah. Gonna be an adjustment...
WILLOW: Sure. It's like five miles away.  Uncharted territory.
BUFFY: Giles says I have to be secret identity  gal again. If too many people know  I'm the slayer, I'm a target blah blah  blah...
WILLOW: That makes sense.
BUFFY: Gonna be tough. With a roommate...
WILLOW: Yeah...
BUFFY: I'm psyched for college, definitely.  I'm just wondering how it's gonna  work with my extracurricular activities.  I gotta make sure it doesn't take the  edge off my slaying. Gotta stay sharp.
STUDENT: Freshmen! We're doing this by folder  color! If you're not holding a yellow  folder, you're in the wrong group!  You belong up by Wiesman hall.
GIRL: WHAT DO WE WANT?
KIDS: <b><u>NOW!!!</u></b>
FELLOW: Rally tomorrow night. We have to let  the administration know how we feel.
BUFFY: Okay. Right.
WOMAN: Have you accepted Jesus Christ as  your personal savior?
BUFFY: Well you know I meant to, and then  I was busy all day...
GUY: Party Thursday at Alpha Delt. Gotta  be there - free jello shots for freshmen  women. That's our guarantee.
BUFFY: Right. Do you know where Wiesman  Hall is?
WILLOW: Buffy!
BUFFY: Hey, Will! Boy am I glad to see you.
WILLOW: Isn't it cool?! There's so much stuff  going on!
BUFFY: Yeah!... Almost, one might say, <b>too</b> much...
WILLOW: I got all my courses, except I had to  switch Modern Poetry for Ethnomusicology,  but that's cool, West African drumming,  I think it's gonna change everything for  me. Have you met your roommate yet? (Buffy shakes her head) Me neither. Hope she's cool.
BUFFY: (re: leaflets) I see you got ticketed too.
WILLOW: Oh yeah! It's great. I've heard about  five different issues and I'm angry  about each and every one of them. (looking at Buffy's) What'd you get?
BUFFY: (holding up the last one) Jello shots.
WILLOW: I didn't get jello shots... (looks through hers) I'll trade you a Take Back the Night...
BUFFY: Are we headed anywhere near  Wiesman? I need to get my I.D. Card.
WILLOW: Oh, I got mine first thing. The lines  are really long now. You should have  gone early.
BUFFY: Well, I hope that I learn from this, and that I grow.
WILLOW: I'm being annoying, aren't I?
BUFFY: No, it's nice that you're all excited.
WILLOW: It's just... In high school, knowledge  was pretty much frowned upon. You  really had to work to learn anything.  But here, I mean, the energy, the  collective intelligence -- it's like this  force, this penetrating force, I can feel  my mind just opening up, you know,  letting the place just thrust into it and...  spurt knowledge... into... that sentence  ended up in a different place than it  started out in.
BUFFY: I get it, though, I do. I'm all for spurty  knowledge, really, I just... it's a little  overwhelming, you know? Don't you  feel that?
WILLOW: (trying to be nice) Well, I mean... Boyfriend!
OZ: Hey, guys.
WILLOW: It's my on-campus boyfriend!
BUFFY: Gee, I forgot to pick mine up. That  line's probably really long now too.
WILLOW: How are you doing?
OZ: Good. This is pretty much a madhouse,  a madhouse.
BUFFY: (jumps on it) Oh, isn't it overwhelming? I was saying  that - aren't you just completely disoriented?
STUDENT: Oz!
OZ: Hey, Paul!
STUDENT: Finally matriculating with us, very cool.  Tell me you guys are playing this week.
OZ: Thursday night. Alpha Delt.
WILLOW: (re: leaflet) Ooh! I have that one.
STUDENT: (to Oz) I'm bringing the wrecking crew. Jello  SHOTS! Do you know where they're  distributing the work study applications?
OZ: Back of Richmond hall, next to the auditorium.
STUDENT: Thanks. See you, bro.
OZ: Yeah.
WILLOW: Library... (picks an entrance) Library! Come on.
BUFFY: It's too bad Giles couldn't be librarian  here. Be convenient.
WILLOW: Well, he says he's enjoying being a  Gentleman of Leisure.
BUFFY: Gentleman of Leisure. Isn't that just  British for "unemployed?"
WILLOW: Uh huh. He's a slacker now.
BUFFY: Speaking of slack, have you heard  anything from Xander?
WILLOW: Not for a while. He's still doing his cross  country see-America thing. He said he  wasn't coming back until he'd driven  to all fifty states.
BUFFY: Did you explain about Hawaii?
WILOW: Well, he seemed so determined...
BUFFY: I hope he gets back soon. It'd be fun  to get the gang together, you know,  hanging out in the... library...
WILLOW: Isn't it amazing?
BUFFY: It's... cozy...
WILLOW: You know, I never wanted to hurt  Giles' feelings, but occult books aside,  our old library didn't have the greatest  selection. But this...
BUFFY: It's, yeah... it'll be great if we ever  need a place for... the Nuremberg rallies...
WILLOW: It's like a REAL library!
WILLOW: Here.
BUFFY: Thanks.
WILLOW: Introduction to Psychology. Up there.
BUFFY: Here.
WILLOW: I think there's a protest next week.
BUFFY: Got it!
RILEY: I'm okay. It's okay.
BUFFY: I'm so, I just... the books were too high,  and then everything was bad.
RILEY: Let me give you a hand.
BUFFY: Uh-huh. I mean the first one.
RILEY: Well, you'll have a lot of fun. Professor  Walsh, she's quite a character.
WILLOW: You've taken it?
RILEY: I'm a T.A. I'll be helping the professor  out. I'm sorry, I've forgotten my manners  in all the concussion. I'm Riley.
WILLOW: Willow. And this is my friend Buffy.
RILEY: It's nice to meet you both.
BUFFY: I'm nice to meet.
WILLOW: Do you know if we're gonna cover  operant conditioning in the first semester?  I heard that was kind of Professor Walsh's  specialty.
RILEY: Absolutely. You know her treatise on  Dietrick's work?
WILLOW: I know <b>of</b> it...
RILEY: It's not on the syllabus but it's a fascinating  read, if you're into that sort of thing.  They have it here.
WILLOW: Ooh! Where?
RILEY: I'll show you.
WILLOW: Well, it's fascinating.
BUFFY: Yeah, 'cause... you know, everyone's  got a brain...
BUFFY: Hello?
KATHY: Oh! Are you Buffy?
BUFFY: Yeah.
KATHY: Kathy.
BUFFY: Yeah, it's nice to meet you.
KATHY: Yeah.
BUFFY: So. It's a pretty nice room.
KATHY: I was surprised, 'cause you hear horror  stories about freshman housing. You  took the right side.
BUFFY: Uh, yeah, but if you wanted to be  on the right...
KATHY: No no, I just wanted to make sure  that was what you wanted. Are  you excited for classes tomorrow?
BUFFY: Painfully.
KATHY: I bet there's a lot of parties to go to  this week, too. Not that I'm a crazy  partier - and I'm not always this hyper,  either. I'm just excited.
BUFFY: I know. Me too.
KATHY: I'm really glad they put me with  someone cool. I can tell you're cool.  I just know this whole year is gonna  be superfun!
RIEGERT: The point of this course is not to  critique popular American culture, it  is not to pick at it or look down upon  it. And it is not to watch videos for credit.
BUFFY: Did he say if this course is full yet?
RIEGERT: The point is to examine its structures,  its schemata and recurrent themes and  there are two people talking at once.  I know that one of them is me.
RIEGERT: The other is a blond girl. You.  Blond girl. Stand up.
BUFFY: Well, I...
RIEGERT: Getting off to kind of a slow start.
BUFFY: I just didn't know if the class was still  open, if we could still sign up...
RIEGERT: (holds up attendance sheet) If your name isn't on this sheet then  you are wasting everyone's time. Are  you on the sheet?
BUFFY: No, but -- I was told that --
RIEGERT: Do you understand? You are sucking  energy from everyone in this room.  You are taking their time, their energy.  They came here to learn. Get out.
BUFFY: I didn't mean... to suck...
RIEGERT: Leave! Thank you.
RILEY: If you're looking for psych, it's through here.
BUFFY: Oh. Thanks.
RILEY: Sorry?
BUFFY: Yesterday... in the store... You  don't remember.
RILEY: Oh, no, sure I remember you. You're  Willow's friend.
BUFFY: (crestfallen) Yeah.
RILEY: My head's fine. It just stung for a bit  and I lost most of my basic motor  functions. No biggy.
BUFFY: Buffy.
RILEY: Right. Have fun.
BUFFY: Um, I'm just wondering - Professor  Walsh isn't planning to yell at me  and kick me out of her class, is she?
RILEY: It's not on her lesson plan...
BUFFY: Great.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) How was Pop Culture?  BUFFY I decided not to take it. It seemed dull.
WALSH: Okay. This is Psych 105, Introduction  to Psychology. I'm Professor Walsh.  Those of you who fall into my good  graces will come to know me as  Maggie. Those of you who don't will  come to know me by the nickname  my T.A.'s use and think I don't know  about, the Evil Bitch-Monster of Death.
BUFFY: Oh!
EDDIE: Oh. Wow. Sorry.
BUFFY: No, I'm sorry. Wasn't looking.
EDDIE: Did you, uh, lose your way?
BUFFY: No, no, I'm just heading to Fischer  Hall, it's right... uh, I know it's... on  the Earth planet, I'm sure of that... (fessing up) Recently voted Most Pathetic, uh huh.
EDDIE: (shows her map) Well, <b>I'm</b> lost, and I have a <b>map</b>, so...
BUFFY: Ooh! I come in second.
EDDIE: Eddie. Edward. I mean - Edward.  But I aspire to be Eddie.
BUFFY: Okay, here's Fischer Hall...
EDDIE: Yeah, and this is Dunwirth, that's my  dorm, but it's us I can't find.
BUFFY: Are we the blue part?
EDDIE: No. Yes.
BUFFY: Yes. Okay, I came from here, so, we  go... that way.
EDDIE: You sound very certain. I'm in.
BUFFY: Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna try. She's not  afraid of the long words, is she?
EDDIE: She's pretty intense. A lot of the courses  are really tough.
BUFFY: I'm a little upset. I had it on good  authority this was a party school.
EDDIE: I think it gets easier.
BUFFY: Yeah, I still feel like carrying around  a security blanket.
EDDIE: Of Human Bondage. Have you ever  read it?
BUFFY: (never heard of it) No, I'm not big on... porn... I mean  I've cut way back.
EDDIE: No, there's no actual bondage. It's  just a novel. I've read it like ten times,  I always take it everywhere. Security  blanket.
BUFFY: Oh. I don't really have one - unless  you count Mr. Pointy.
EDDIE: Mr. Pointy?
BUFFY: Hey, bike path!
EDDIE: I suspect there's a lot of us.
BUFFY: I'll look for you in Psych.
EDDIE: Yeah, maybe we can help each other  figure out what the hell they're talking  about.
BUFFY: Cool.
EDDIE: Maybe even make it through the year.
SUNDAY: I'm sorry...
OZ: Looking for someone?
BUFFY: Yeah...
WILLOW: You've made a friend? Good for you.
BUFFY: Thanks, Mom...
SUNDAY: Boring, boring, slightly less boring,  boring, astonishingly boring... we gotta  kill some cool people. Will someone  remind me?
DAV: You're the one who said pick on the  weak ones. Thin the herd and all that.  Does this sweater make me look fat?
SUNDAY: No, the fact that you're fat makes  you look fat. The sweater makes you  look purple.
DAV: You're such a loser.
SUNDAY: (mock pain) Hey. Words can hurt like a fist.
ROOKIE: Check it out.
SUNDAY: Well?
ROOKIE: I guess.
SUNDAY: Do we have a Klimt?
ROOKIE: A big score for Klimt!
SUNDAY: Freshmen, Man, they're so predictable.
ROOKIE: And you can never eat just one.
DAV: Yeah, I'm hungry.
SUNDAY: What a shock. We eat when I saw we eat.
DAV: We could hit the tunnels...
SUNDAY: We eat --
DAV: God, lighten up.
ROOKIE: I think it's funny when you scream.  It's like, whoah...
SUNDAY: I need better lackeys. I swear. I  shouldn't even bring you guys on  the hunt.
DAV: Great. Why don't you let dead Eddie  get your dinner?
SUNDAY: That's pretty much the plan.
BUFFY: Giles?
OLIVIA: Rupert, is this blue cheese, or it is  just cheese that's gone blue?
BUFFY: You're not Giles either -- unless he  had a much more interesting week  than I did.
OLIVIA: He does.
GILES: Buffy! Hello.
BUFFY: Is this a bad time?
GILES: No, uh, forgive me. This is Olivia.  Old friend, stopping over for a few  days.
OLIVIA: Couldn't pass through Sunny Cal  without looking up old Ripper.
BUFFY: Uh huh...
GILES: (to Olivia) Buffy is a... was a student of mine.  And how is University?
BUFFY: Kind of like high school. In the sense  of that I sort of need help.
GILES: Ah. Help. Yes.
BUFFY: But this looks like a bad time.
OLIVIA: No, you guys talk. I'll go slip into  something a little less comfortable.
GILES: So, trouble with your, uh, studies?
BUFFY: It's a bad time.
GILES: You keep saying that.
BUFFY: Well, it looks pretty bad! I think someone  has just a little too much free time on  their hands.
GILES: I'm not supposed to have a private life?
BUFFY: No, because you're very very old and  it's gross.
GILES: Well, before I succumb to the ravages  of age, why don't you tell me what  brings you here.
BUFFY: There's a student missing.
GILES: Yes?
BUFFY: Eddie. He's supposed to have left  school, but I don't think he did. I met  him outside last night -- I went back  there and right near where I saw him  there was a struggle.
GILES: You suspect vampire activity?
BUFFY: That was my first thought. Actually,  that was my only thought.
GILES: And?
BUFFY: What do you mean, "and"? And we  need to stop them! Eddie's R.A. said  kids disappear a lot. There could be a  group of vampires working the campus.  We need research, and charts and stuff.
GILES: I'm still not sure where I come in.  You haven't described anything you  can't do yourself.
BUFFY: Okay, remember before you became  Hugh Hefner, when you were a watcher?
GILES: Officially, you no longer have a watcher.  Buffy, you know I will always be here  when you need me. Your safety is more  important to me than anything. But  you are going to have to look after  yourself. You're out of school now  and I can't always be there to guide  you.
BUFFY: Oh. Okay. I'm sorry to bug you.
GILES: Buffy --  BUFFY No. You're right. I can deal. I was  just... yeah. I'm on it. Thanks.
GILES: I'm here if you need me.
OLIVIA: She's gone?
GILES: Yes.
OLIVIA: So. Did you help her out?
GILES: I'm not sure.
BUFFY: How am I supposed to hunt in this  mob? Don't you people have homes?
BUFFY: Eddie, wait up! God, I was worried  something had happened to you and  yes of course did because you're a vampire.
EDDIE: I'm not.
BUFFY: You will be.
SUNDAY: The Slayer?
BUFFY: And you are...
SUNDAY: I'm Sunday. I'll be killing you in a  minute or so.
BUFFY: You know, that threat gets more  frightening every time I hear it.
ROOKIE: Are we gonna fight, or is there just  gonna be a monster sarcasm rally?
DAV: I'm in for a piece.
BUFFY: Everyone gets to play...
SUNDAY: Guys. This is totally mine.
ROOKIE: Okay, but you gotta share the eatins',  'cause I'm thinking slayer blood's gotta  be, whoah, like thai stick.
BUFFY: I thought people in college were  supposed to get smarter.
SUNDAY: I think you had a lot of misconceptions  about college. Like that anyone would  be caught dead wearing <b>that</b>.
ROOKIE: No, the best part was when you ragged  on her clothes. She was all like, "nooo,  not the ensemble..."
SUNDAY: Those jeans? With the little patches?  She has no one to blame but herself.
DAV: I heard they're coming back.
SUNDAY: Not if I kill every single person who  wears them.
DAV: Still think you should have let us have  a piece. Could have finished her off.
SUNDAY: Oh, she's not lasting the night! She's  a done deal. (inspiration) In face.... guys, you're gonna hit the  tunnels.
BUFFY: Mom?
JOYCE: Buffy! Honey, how are you?
BUFFY: I'm okay...
JOYCE: How's college? Have you been  fighting?
BUFFY: They started it.
JOYCE: As long as you're being careful... I  didn't think you'd show here for a  while.
BUFFY: Well, I didn't have classes today, and  everything is so hectic, I just thought  it'd be nice to come home and crash for  a few...
JOYCE: Uh, well, yeah... I really didn't think  you'd be back for a couple of weeks...  I didn't move anything of yours, it's  still your room.
BUFFY: You've filled it with packing crates.
JOYCE: But I didn't move anything...
BUFFY: If it's still my room, shouldn't I be  able to fit in it?
JOYCE: It's just for a couple of weeks while  we do inventory at the gallery. I really  didn't think you'd be coming back so  soon...
BUFFY: Neither did I.
BUFFY: Hello?
XANDER: The whole world in front of her, and  she comes back to this dive.
BUFFY: Xander!
XANDER: Hey, Buff.
BUFFY: When did you get back?
XANDER: Couple of days ago.
BUFFY: You freak of nature! Why didn't you call?
XANDER: I knew you guys were starting the  whole college adventure, I didn't  want to, you know, help you move.
BUFFY: I missed you. How was your trip? Is  America nice? I hear it's nice.
XANDER: There was some purple mountains  majesty, I'm gonna have to say.
BUFFY: What'd you do? What'd you see?
XANDER: Well...
BUFFY: Come on, tell!
XANDER: Grand Canyon.
BUFFY: (admiringly) You saw the Grand Canyon...
XANDER: Well, I saw the movie "Grand Canyon".  On cable. Really lame.
BUFFY: (a little confused) Oh.
XANDER: Basically I got as far as Oxnard and  the engine fell out of my car. And that  was literally, so I ended up washing  dishes at the fabulous "Ladies Night"  club for about a month and a half while  I tried to pay for the repairs. Nobody  really bothered me or spoke to me there  until one night one of the male strippers  called in sick and no power on this  Earth will make me tell you the rest of  <b>that</b> story. Suffice to say I traded in my  car for one that wasn't made entirely of  rust and came trundling back home to the  arms of my loving parents and everything's  exactly as it was except I sleep in the  basement and I have to pay rent. How's  college?
BUFFY: Male strippers?
XANDER: No power on this Earth.
BUFFY: Okay. College is great.
XANDER: Uh huh. Once more with even less  feeling.
BUFFY: No, really. Willow's in heaven -- Oz  got this great off-campus house with  the band...
XANDER: And you're sitting alone at the Bronze  looking like you were just diagnosed  with cancer of the puppy.
BUFFY: It's just... it's this vampire. She took  me down, and I'm not sure how to  stop her.
XANDER: Then where's the gang? Avengers  assemble, let's get it going.
BUFFY: I don't want to bug them... just starting  school, they don't need this...
XANDER: Okay, Buff. What's the what here.
BUFFY: I don't know, I just... what if I can't cut it.
XANDER: Can't cut what? Slaying?
BUFFY: Slaying... everything.
XANDER: Buffy, this is all about fear. It's  understandable, but you can't let it  control you. Fear leads to anger.  Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to  anger... no wait... Fear leads to hate,  hate leads to the dark side... hold on...  Hate... no First you get the women,  then you get the money, then you  get... okay forget that.
BUFFY: Well, thanks for the dada-ist pep  talk. I feel much more abstract.
XANDER: The point is, you're Buffy!
BUFFY: Yeah, sure, in high school I was Buffy...
XANDER: And what, in college you're Betty  Louise?
BUFFY: Yes, I'm Betty Louise Plotnik of  Blue Falls Missouri. Or I might  as well be.
XANDER: Buffy, I've been through some fairly  dark times in my life. Faced some scary  things, among them the kitchen of the  fabulous "Ladies Night" club. Let me  tell you something. When it's dark and  I'm all alone, and I'm scared or  freaking out or whatever, I always  think, "What would Buffy do?" (beat) You're my hero.
BUFFY: Can that be one of those things you  never ever tell me about?
XANDER: It's a deal.
BUFFY: I think I say thank you.
XANDER: And nothing says "thank you" like  dollars in the waistband. Okay. What  do we do first?
BUFFY: Kids disappearing every year. Not  too many. Just enough so everyone  believes they up and left.
XANDER: I can't believe the vampires took your  stuff. Murder I expect, but petty larceny  just seems so... petty.
BUFFY: Well, they have to be keeping it  somewhere. On campus or real near by.
XANDER: (sees something) How far back do the disappearances  go?
BUFFY: Seems like they weren't too common  till like '82.
XANDER: Magic number. Check it out.
BUFFY: Psi-Theta loses its charter, building to  be closed for renovation.
XANDER: 1982. And look here.
BUFFY: Looks pretty cherry...
XANDER: You up for a little reconnaissance?
BUFFY: You mean where we all a paint and  sculpt and stuff like that?
XANDER: No, that was the renaissance.
BUFFY: It's been a long week. Let's go  look at the house.
BUFFY: Score.
BUFFY: Oh. OH! That's my skirt. You'll never  fit in that with those hips!
XANDER: We need weapons.
BUFFY: I don't see my trunk down there. It  was under my bed. If they missed it -  Mr. Gordo! Get your filthy -- ooh!  Okay. Go to my room. If my weapons  trunk isn't there, try Willow's. I'll  keep an eye on these -- my diary...  that's so unfair...
XANDER: I'll hurry.
BUFFY: Laugh all you want. This time, we  play it my way, and the rules are  just a little bit --
BUFFY: Ooh.
SUNDAY: Who the hell...
BUFFY: Just thought I'd drop in... get it?  Drop in?? Boy. Tough room.
SUNDAY: I have to say, you've really got me  now. This is a diabolical plan. Throw  yourself at my feet with a broken arm  and no weapons of any kind, how  am I ever gonna get out of this one?
BUFFY: You've got a nice setup here. (ominous) But you made one mistake.
BUFFY: (dropping the act) Well, I'm not actually positive yet,  but statistically speaking, people  usually make at least --
KATHY: It seemed kind of weird.
OZ: (looking over the note) Weird's a pretty good word for it.
WILLOW: Buffy would never just take off. It's  just not in her nature except for that  one time she disappeared for several  months and changed her name but  there were circumstances then. There's  no circumstances.
KATHY: Does Buffy have a history of emotional  problems? 'Cause on my request form  I was pretty specific about a <b>stable</b>  non-smoker.
OZ: I don't think this is her writing.
WILLOW: I bet there were circumstances. We've  probably been so wrapped up in our  own petty lives that we totally missed  the circumstances. We're bad friends.
OZ: Let's think this through.
WILLOW: How can you be so calm?
OZ: Long, arduous hours of practice. Now  either Buffy took off, or she's been  robbed, or --
XANDER: It's a prank!
WILLOW: Xander!
XANDER: How are my guys!?
KATHY: No.
XANDER: And this is very intrusive, isn't it.
KATHY: Little bit.
XANDER: Xander.
KATHY: Kathy.
XANDER: Do we hug?
OZ: I think we're too manly.
WILLOW: What's a prank?
XANDER: Prank? Oh! The room! Some friends  of Buffy's played a funny joke, they  took her stuff and now she wants us  to help get it back from her friends  who sleep all day and have no tans.
WILLOW: Oh, those friends.
OZ: They're funny guys.
XANDER: So they took the chest. Well, let's go  then and go to our friend. It was nice  meeting you, Kathy.
KATHY: You too. Stop by sometime.
XANDER: Let's go to Will's, get supplies.
WILLOW: Is Buffy in danger?
XANDER: She's in a holding pattern. We've got  some time.
SUNDAY: Oh, this is my favorite item. What  better way to say, I am the very most  of geek."
BUFFY: You don't want to touch that.
SUNDAY: This arm's not looking so good. It  might have to come off.
BUFFY: You wanna know the truth?
ROOKIE: This is starting to suck...
BUFFY: When you look back at this, in the  three seconds it takes to turn to dust,  I think you'll find the mistake was  touching my stuff.
SUNDAY: What about breaking your arm?
BUFFY: Let me answer that question with a  headbutt.
OZ: Hey, Buff. You need a hand?
BUFFY: No thanks...
XANDER: So, all that other stuff in there, that's  just gonna sit there, right? I mean,  nobody owns it in the strictest sense...
OZ: Seems wrong somehow.
XANDER: Dibs on the rowing machine.
GILES: Buffy!
WILLOW: Hi Giles.
XANDER: What's with the arsenal?
GILES: Buffy, I've been up all night. I know  I'm supposed to teach you self-reliance,  but I'm not leaving you out there to  fight alone. The hell with what's right!  I'm ready to back you up. Let's find  that evil and fight it together.
BUFFY: Great. Thanks. We'll get right on that.
GILES: The evil is this way?
BUFFY: My room is.
WILLOW: Giles, can you get this box on top?
XANDER: (to Buffy) College not that scary after all, huh?
BUFFY: It's turning out to be a lot like high  school. Which I can handle. You  know, at least I know what to expect.
