Stop flicking at me.
(not looking up) Frere means brother.
There's more to it than wiping and kicking.
Mixing drinks comes to mind.
(wistful) Well, Xander, even if I had a pretend cigarette, I couldn't tell you my problems. Real ones have clogged up my headspace.
Class time.
You know, it's probably just him, having trouble dealing, right? I mean, sometimes, guys keep the girls they really like inside these little deep-brain, fantasy bubbles where things are always perfect.
So, maybe, <u>I'm</u> in <u>his</u> bubble. And pretty soon, he'll just realize he wants more than just Bubble-Buffy. And, he'll pop me out and we'll have dinner and stuff. (convincing herself) Guys totally do that, right?
But he can be really sweet. You know, I think he has intimacy issues, 'cause of his father dying -
Oh! Sorry.
In my defense, you take up a lot of space.
Uh, no, I… saw Parker there…
(fishing, not thrilled) He's kind of a girl chaser, huh?
Sorry, what?
Uh huh…
It's just… Parker's problem with intimacy turns out to be that he can't get enough of it. And I knew that, I knew what he was, but… You know, if he were tied up and gagged and left in a cave that vampires HAPPENED to frequent that wouldn't really be like I killed him really…
(teary eyed) I'm a slut.
A big, lecherous loser.
(brave face) I'm better. This has helped.
Sorry. I'm bumping into people today.
TV is a good thing. Bright colors, music… little tiny people.
I'm suffering the after-ness of a bad night of badness.
No, with five really smart guys.
I went to see Xander, but then I saw Parker and… then came beer.
(snort-laugh) Pfah… gutter-face, no! Just lots 'n lots 'o beer. It's nice. Foamy and comforting. It's beer.
Okay.
S'good… good enough!
Yeah. Foamy.
You're stupid!
(re: Colm) Smelly head.
No, <u>you</u>.
Hey!
(to jukebox) It sings!
(to Xander) Like it.
Want more singing. Want more… beer.
Did it hurt?
No. Like beer. Beer…good.
Say bye.
(pouty) Bye.
Parker bad!
Want people. Where people go?
WANT! Want people!
(sidling up to Xander) Boy smell nice.
Beer! Want beer!
(darkly) <b>Want beer.</b>
Fire…bad!
AAHOOWW!
Bad, bad, bad…
Tired.
Foamy.
