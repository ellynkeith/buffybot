XANDER: Rough day?
XANDER: Come on Buffy, be a lonely drunk. (beat) Rough day?
BUFFY: Stop flicking at me.
XANDER: Work with me here. I'm finally an essential part of your collegey life. No more "looking down on the townie" - I'm the new bartender at the pub. Got my lighter, my rag, my empathy face…
WILLOW: Aren't you too young to be a bartender?
XANDER: Au contraire, mon frere.
BUFFY: (not looking up) Frere means brother.
XANDER: Mon girl-frere. Behold.
WILLOW: I don't believe this is entirely on the up and up.
XANDER: What gives it away?
WILLOW: Looking at it.
BUFFY: There's more to it than wiping and kicking.
BUFFY: Mixing drinks comes to mind.
XANDER: I've seen Cocktail. I can hippy hippy shake.
BUFFY: (wistful) Well, Xander, even if I had a pretend cigarette, I couldn't tell you my problems. Real ones have clogged up my headspace.
XANDER: Then unload 'em right here, baby. (flicks the lighter) Rough day? Wanna tell me about it? (off her look) Shutting up now.
WILLOW: I'm pregnant by my step-brother who'd rather be with my best friend and left me with no place to live and no food, except for a bottle of Wild Turkey, which I drank all up.
WILLOW: That was me, being tanked and friendless for ya.
XANDER: Gets my Oscar nod.
BUFFY: Class time.
XANDER: (to Will) So, you gonna come by tonight? To the pub?
WILLOW: Oz. Bronze. Date.
BUFFY: You know, it's probably just him, having trouble dealing, right? I mean, sometimes, guys keep the girls they really like inside these little deep-brain, fantasy bubbles where things are always perfect.
XANDER: (to Buffy) How's that fugue state coming along?
WILLOW: (to Xander) Parker.
BUFFY: So, maybe, <u>I'm</u> in <u>his</u> bubble. And pretty soon, he'll just realize he wants more than just Bubble-Buffy. And, he'll pop me out and we'll have dinner and stuff. (convincing herself) Guys totally do that, right?
WILLOW: Buffy that is my best friend, you need to think about not Parker. He's no good. There are other men -  better men - men wherein the mind is stronger than the penis.
XANDER: <b>Nothing can defeat the penis!</b> (off their looks) Too loud, very unseemly.
WILLOW: I'm sorry to be coarse, but I feel strongly on the subject of stinky Parker man.
BUFFY: But he can be really sweet. You know, I think he has intimacy issues, 'cause of his father dying -
WILLOW: Not interested. You get troubles, tell 'em to the bartender.
XANDER: That's right. 'Cause the bartender's always ready to listen.
XANDER: (shouting) What? WHAT?!
XANDER: Okay… (to others) You're a rum and coke, you're a Poker's Light… Vodka on the rocks and… A water? Is that right?
XANDER: (to himself) Ice water - how do I make that?
RILEY: Whoah!
BUFFY: Oh! Sorry.
RILEY: You know, most people go around.  I'm not saying you CAN'T tunnel through me, I just think the other way's quicker.
BUFFY: In my defense, you take up a lot of space.
RILEY: I do. I'm ungainly. You looking for someone?
BUFFY: Uh, no, I… saw Parker there…
RILEY: (with wry disdain) Right, Parker and his latest conquest. That boy should have his attention span checked.
BUFFY: (fishing, not thrilled) He's kind of a girl chaser, huh?
RILEY: Sets 'em up and knocks 'em down. I guess maybe I'm old fashioned, but my father always says if you want to be a gentleman… you don't care even the slightest bit what my father says.
BUFFY: Sorry, what?
RILEY: (good-natured) Forget about it. I got people waiting. I'll see you in class.
BUFFY: Uh huh…
XANDER: Rough day?
PAULA: Nah, I've been super.
PAULA: We accepted Melody's pledge and made her an official sister of Beta Delta Gamma. And, our pins arrived today. I designed them myself!
XANDER: You are so sharp.
COLM: Hey, Paula. Are you keeping this fine bartender from his duties? Man's got to earn a living.
XANDER: S'alright.
COLM: (quieter) So, the guys and I were celebrating about the…
XANDER: (piping in, cheery) No really, it's alright. I'm due for a break.
COLM: (a little annoyed) Oh. So, what were you discussing? Maybe we can all join.
PAULA: (chuckling) Oh be nice.
XANDER: (reconsidering) Hm, no, forget it.
COLM: No, I rudely interrupted. And it sounds like you two were having quite the meeting of minds. (to Xander) Possibly debating the geo-political ramifications of bio-engineering? You have a take on that?
XANDER: I've got beer. Want some beer?
COLM: Pitcher of Black Frost. (as Xander pours) See, I think we have a perfect venue here for conducting sociometry here. Bipolar continuum of attraction and rejection. Given your socio-economic statuses, I foresee a… (indicates Paula and Xander respectively) …"B" rejects "A" diad.
COLM: I'm sorry, let me clarify. (leans in, whispers) You see, <u>we</u> are this country's future. <u>You</u> keep the bowl of peanuts full. <u>We</u> are what these girls want.
COLM: And four glasses.
XANDER: How about I see some I.D. first? 'Cause you're not getting a drop until I'm satisfied that -
JACK: (cutting him off) Just give 'em the beer.
XANDER: Buffy?
XANDER: (softly, sincerely) Rough day? (off her nod) Want to tell me about it?
BUFFY: It's just… Parker's problem with intimacy turns out to be that he can't get enough of it. And I knew that, I knew what he was, but… You know, if he were tied up and gagged and left in a cave that vampires HAPPENED to frequent that wouldn't really be like I killed him really…
XANDER: Buffy…
BUFFY: (teary eyed) I'm a slut.
XANDER: No.
BUFFY: A big, lecherous loser.
XANDER: No.
JACK: Hey!
XANDER: Sorry. So sorry.
BUFFY: (brave face) I'm better. This has helped.
XANDER: Don't go anywhere.
BUFFY: Sorry. I'm bumping into people today.
ROY: I can't imagine anybody minding…
ROY: You're not thinking of leaving, are you? 'Cause we have a strict policy against you leaving. At least until you've had a drink.
COLM: My friend's just saying, you shouldn't be alone and sad right now. You're a beautiful girl who should be covered with men. (beat) And could we be those men?
KIP: It's on us.
WILLOW: (mimicking Oz) "I'm Oz, I'm in a band, too. And this is Willow." (mimicking Veruca) "How fun, a groupie!" (mad Willow) GROUPIE!
BUFFY: TV is a good thing. Bright colors, music… little tiny people.
WILLOW: Whoah, what you have you done with Buffy?
BUFFY: I'm suffering the after-ness of a bad night of badness.
WILLOW: You <u>didn't</u>! Not with Parker again.
BUFFY: No, with five really smart guys.
WILLOW: (utter disgust) Five! Ow. Oh. (then deep concern) Oh, Buffy. Are you okay? Want to tell me about it?
BUFFY: I went to see Xander, but then I saw Parker and… then came beer.
WILLOW: And then group sex?
BUFFY: (snort-laugh) Pfah… gutter-face, no! Just lots 'n lots 'o beer. It's nice. Foamy and comforting. It's beer.
WILLOW: Drowning your troubles 'cause of Parker, the mind-frying man! He deserves a torturous and slow death by spider bites. (beat) Well, for today, we can shoot spit balls at the back of his neck in class.
BUFFY: Okay.
WILLOW: But getting dressed would be fun, too.
BUFFY: S'good… good enough!
COLM: No more? But s'good.
BUFFY: Yeah. Foamy.
KIP: (to Buffy) You should come to our class on big thinking. S'good.
WOMAN: Boy, I'm having the worst day…
WOMAN: You got a light?
COLM: I like girls.
BUFFY: You're stupid!
COLM: No, you! Stupid!
ROY: (to Colm) No, <u>you</u> stupid!
BUFFY: (re: Colm) Smelly head.
COLM: You stupid.
ROY: No, you stupid.
BUFFY: No, <u>you</u>.
BUFFY: Hey!
BUFFY: (to jukebox) It sings!
BUFFY: (to Xander) Like it.
XANDER: Time to go home, Buffy.
BUFFY: Want more singing. Want more… beer.
XANDER: No. I've cut you off.
BUFFY: Did it hurt?
XANDER: Out you go.
BUFFY: No. Like beer. Beer…good.
XANDER: No, beer bad. Bad, bad beer. What the hell am I saying? Go home and go to bed.
BUFFY: Say bye.
XANDER: Bye.
BUFFY: (pouty) Bye.
XANDER: (beat) Pay up and go home, guys.
COLM: Mmph.
XANDER: (picking through them) I'll take this one and this one. And… (beat) Man, you know, I've always had a problem calculating the tip. And you guys being so dapper of brain, maybe you could help me.
XANDER: Good. Okay. See, if your bill comes to sixty dollars. And generally, people tip… what, approximately thirty percent? That would make your tip, what?
XANDER: You are so smart! This is <u>so</u> the right amount!
XANDER: Somebody didn't have their fiber today.
XANDER: Hey, you alright in there?
CREATURE: AAAAARRRRGGGHH!
ROY: Oh…God…
HUNT: S'get outa h-
XANDER: Colm?
XANDER: We're cool. Easy.
XANDER: (yells) Help! (scared) Oh God.
COLM: Fire. Bad. (conflicted) Fire…pretty.
XANDER: Fire angry!
XANDER: Jack, JACK! We got a problem. They guys, they, they're… (sudden calm) some of your patrons are turning into cave men.
JACK: They had it coming.
XANDER: What!?
JACK: I have been taking abuse from snot-nosed kids for twenty years. Come in here with their snotty attitudes, drinking their fruity microbrews and spouting on about philosophy like it means a damn thing. Think they're different than us.
XANDER: Well they are now…
JACK: They ain't. That's the great thing about beer. Makes all men the same.
XANDER: (frantic) Why are we talking about beer? The guys are… (realization) …the beer.
JACK: Neat, huh? My brother in law's a warlock. Showed me how to -
XANDER: No! No neat! I served them that beer. (oh shit!) I served Buffy that beer. (calmly) Uh, how much beer would you say a person would need to consume before they started seriously questing for fire?
JACK: Relax. It'll wear off in a day or so.
XANDER: In a day or so, someone's gonna get killed.
XANDER: You're a bad bad man.
XANDER: I cut her off before the others. I don't think she had as much to drink.
GILES: I can't believe you served Buffy that beer.
XANDER: I didn't know it was evil!
GILES: You knew it was <b>beer</b>…
XANDER: Well excuse me Mr. I-Spent-the-60's -in-an-electric-koolaid-funky-satan-groove.
GILES: Early seventies and you should both know better.
XANDER: Hey, I'm not the dad of her. Buffy's a grown up, and she's intelligent enough to -
BUFFY: Parker bad!
PARKER: I don't mean this in a bragging way, but I do get to know a lot of women.
WILLOW: Well, getting to know people is good.
PARKER: But I haven't found the "one" yet.  I've yet to find a girl that I can just… you know, sit with, feeling totally at ease spewing whatever's on my mind. Or even sit with, comfortably in silence.
PARKER: Willow… Can I tell you something private?
WILLOW: Okay. I mean, I feel like you've shown me a perspective I hadn't really thought much about before.
PARKER: Just that I've enjoyed talking with you. Here, tonight.
WILLOW: (smiles) Me too. I mean, with you. You know, I'm wondering something. About you.
PARKER: What?
WILLOW: (maintains sweet tone) Just how gullible do you think I am? I mean, with your gentle eyes and your shy smile and your ability to talk openly with only me… (beat) You're unbelievable!
PARKER: What?
WILLOW: This isn't sharing. This isn't connecting. It's the pleasure principle! That's right, I've got your number, Id Boy. Only thing you're thinking about is how long before you can jump on my bones!
PARKER: Look, if you think -
WILLOW: You men! It's all about the sex. Find a woman, drag her to your den. Do whatever's necessary. Just as long as you get the sex. (beat) I tell you, men have not changed since the dawn of time!
WILLOW: See!?!
WILLOW: (to Parker) This way!
GILES: Fascinating, really.
BUFFY: Want people. Where people go?
GILES: (each word slowly) The TV is off.
BUFFY: WANT! Want people!
GILES: Well, at least she doesn't seem to be in any immediate danger. Maybe you should just stay with her…
BUFFY: (sidling up to Xander) Boy smell nice.
GILES: Or perhaps she should be alone.
XANDER: Yeah, I think we need to track down the funboys somewhat pronto. Jack said the beer wouldn't wear off till -
BUFFY: Beer! Want beer!
GILES: You can't have beer -
BUFFY: (darkly) <b>Want beer.</b>
XANDER: (eyeing her) Giles, don't make caveslayer unhappy…
XANDER: Yes, Buffy strong.
XANDER: No, Buffy get -
XANDER: Giles…
GILES: I'm fine. Get her.
XANDER: Which way?
GILES: Let's split up. We've got to find her before someone gets hurt.
HUNT: Woman. (punches self) Man.
COLM: Woman! Yaahhh!
XANDER: Buffy!…Buffy!…
XANDER: Ah hah. Can't find the beer. Good. Freshman girl not able to hold the beer, should not have it. Get into trouble.
XANDER: Okay, all good, remember the boy, boy smell nice? Yeah? Any part of Buffy still in there?
XANDER: Oh no.
BUFFY: Fire…bad!
BUFFY: AAHOOWW!
WILLOW: Buffy…
BUFFY: Bad, bad, bad…
XANDER: (to the caveboys) Stay.
XANDER: Are you all right?
WILLOW: Buffy's still in there…
PARKER: Oh God…
PARKER: Help me… I can't breathe…
PARKER: Buffy, what do we do, oh God…
XANDER: You guys had enough fun for one night?
WILLOW: Yes please.
BUFFY: Tired.
XANDER: And was there a lesson in all this? What have we learned about beer?
BUFFY: Foamy.
XANDER: Good. Just as long as we're clear.
XANDER: Anyway, I think the boys are contained for the time being.
XANDER: They'll figure out how to work the door locks when the effect has worn off. And they'll just think they had too much beer. Which is surely close enough.
WILLOW: Whose van is that?
XANDER: I dunno. Wasn't locked.
PARKER: Buffy. I… I don't know how to say this.  I'm sorry for how I treated you before. It was wrong of me, and… I'm sorry. (beat) And, you were great tonight. Really. (beat) I may not deserve this, but… Do you think, you could… forgive me?
