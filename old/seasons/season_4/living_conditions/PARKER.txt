The person you're hiding from.
Freshman, huh?  BUFFY It's that obvious?
There are signs. For instance, people  who've been around for a while know  how to use their dining hall card.
Work it right and you can get three meals  worth. Which equals fewer punch cards  used annually-
Right. The goal is to polish off as much  as humanly possible in one sitting -  enough to get you through the day if  necessary - while chipmunking items  for future consumption.
Excess dry goods fit nicely in a back  pack or pocket. The wetter items,  your macaronies, your turkey loaf -  then you're into Ziplocks, it's not  for beginners.
So...  Now Buffy sees WILLOW, who smiles and waves from the table she shares with Oz and Xander.
I have someone waiting. Otherwise, I'd... (offers his hand) Parker Abrams. I'm at Kresge Hall.
Okay. Well, see you around, Buffy  Summers of Stevenson.

No. It's totally cool. I should go anyway.
Another time for sure.  (to Kathy) Bye Kathy.
