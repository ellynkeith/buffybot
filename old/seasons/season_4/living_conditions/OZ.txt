(nods) Gotta respect the drive by.
No question. He'll be back.
Actually - worst part? I'd have to go  with the demon pouring blood down  your throat.
Stuff like leeches? And a Bloody  Mary minus the Mary?

She's definitely pushing the stress  meter on this Kathy thing.
Hits the red zone?
So, you either hit her - or you did your  wacky mime routine for her.
Nobody deserves mime, Buffy.

Just here to help.
Seemed more interesting than homework.
Not in question.
Just one thing - do you think the ranting  may be scaring off potential demons?
On the plus side - you killed the bench.  Which was looking shifty.
Agreed.
(interrupting him) Don't engage. I'm pretty sure the next  part is about fava beans and nice Chianti.
Then we'd better go over there and  check them.
Yeah. But Buffy's got a pretty good  lead on us.
Leaving Xander and me to go help  Buffy in the flesh.
