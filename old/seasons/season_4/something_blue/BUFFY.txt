(teasingly/re: banner) You have something to tell me?
It's good that you're open about it.  How are your parents dealing?
We were talking about having  a picnic?
(grasping the concept) Practicing.
And that's just what every girl  longs to hear.
(smiling wryly) Like an exam.
Right around "beautiful".
It's just different, you know? A picnic -  first of all, daylight, kind of a new  venue Buffywise... and the best part,  he said he'd bring all the food. All I  have to do is show up and eat - two  things I'm really good at!  WILLOW So he's nice.
Very very.
Oh yeah. He's just got - have you  looked at his arms? Those are good  arms to have. Riley is... I really like  him. I do...
I don't know. I love being around him,  I think he cares about me, but...  I still feel like something's missing...
Exactly! (then) Riley seems so solid. Like he's not the  type to give a girl grief.
I know. I gotta get over the whole bad  boy thing. There's no good there.  Seeing Angel in L.A. - even for five  minutes - hello to the pain.
But then I can't help thinking, isn't  that where the fire comes from?  Can a nice safe relationship be that  intense? It's nuts, but part of me  believes that real love and passion  have to go hand in hand with lots of pain and fighting-
(the millionth time) You saw their faces, but you can't  describe them.
Uh-huh. And the lab....?
That's it. The invalid amnesiac routine  is over. Kitchen closed 'til you tell me  something useful about the commandos.
How long are you going to pull this crap?
Flaccid?
Giles, help! He's gonna scold me!
You want something nicer?
You wanna start again?
She's still got a way to go, but yeah -  I think she's dealing.
Guess so.
I know. It feels like that now...
Driving.
You seriously drive for fun?
Actually, no-wheeling is more my  speciality. I'm an avid pedestrian,  though.
I took the class. But cars and Buffy  are like - unmixy things.
We are talking about driving, right?
I'm in.
What - did something happen? What's wrong?
Oh.
Yeah.
(perplexed) Wow. Way to rebound.
(bemused) Sounds like a good policy.
- drunk?
No - big! Anybody remember when  Buffy had a fun beer fest and  went One Million Years BC?
I'm taking you home now.
You'll thank me when you still have a  friend left in the morning.
And it will be. I promise. But it's going  to take some time.
I know. But that's how it is. You have  to go through the pain.
Giles just worries. Spells can be really  dangerous. It doesn't mean he thinks  you're a bad witch.
No, you're a good witch!
Yeah, but you don't want him to stay  because you -
You're being too -
So she did a good spell - but the plan  kind of sucked. I mean, she's the one  stuck eating pellets out of a plastic cup-
Spike escaped.
Sorry. Duty thing.
Willow. I can't hang with you until I get  Spike back to Giles'. You know that.
I thought that was going to take longer.
What are you talking about?
I don't think so.
Spike, there's nothing here.
(pulls him up) Drop the act.
That's it. I'm gagging you.
One more word out of you and I  swear -
Oh, I've got the stones. I've got a whole... bunch of stones.
(calls out) Giles! I accidentally killed Spike!  That's okay, right?
Make a move. Please. I'm dying for  good slay.
It's just so.. So sudden! I don't know  what to say!
Oh, Spike! Of course it's yes!
Here you go, Sweetie. Ninety-eight point six.
Ceremony, guests, reception... there's  so much to decide.
How about a daytime ceremony  in the park?
(getting impatient) Under the trees. Indirect sunlight only.
Okay, stop it! This is our wedding and  you're treating it like a huge joke!
Stop!
Giles? Did you see my ring?
Giles, I... I'm not crazy; I know you  probably don't approve... and my  Dad's not that far away, I could  probably... but this day is about  family, my real family. And I want  it to be you that gives me away.
(looks to Spike) Living the dream.
I guess they all will. They weren't  crazy about Angel at first.
Sorry. Let's talk about where we  should register.
Hey, you think the shadow of Drusilla  isn't hanging over me? That I won't  be wondering if you're thinking about  her on our honeymoon when you're  making sweet love to me?
What? How could that happen?
We'll fix it, don't worry.
See, this is how it'll be from now on.  Spike'll even take care of you while  I'm at the majik shop. From now on,  he's family.
Oh! Look...
(sweet regret) Riley..
I really like you. I hope know that  you mean a lot to me. And if things  were different...
You have to promise me that we'll  always be friends. And I want  you to be there on the day.
The wedding!
My wedding! I'm getting married!  Can you believe it?
It's crazy, I know, I mean we've been  fighting for years and then - sometimes  you just look at each and you know,  you know?
I think maybe we fought so much  because we didn't know how to  admit what we felt.
I really think you'd like him. Well,  nobody really likes him...
I don't really like him...
... but I love him. I do.
What?
Who?
Spike.
Don't be mad.
No, you are.
Spike? Oh no, he's totally old.
(chuckling) Well, he's not as old as my last  boyfriend, but -
But -
They were out of Taggis Root. They'll  have more tomorrow. I'm completely  on top of this. (re cake couple) Aren't they a perfect little us?
How about red paint... we can smear his  little mouth - the blood of the innocent.
Honey, we have to talk about invitations.  Do you want to be "William the Bloody"  or, like just "Spike"? 'Cause either way  it's gonna look majorly weird.
What's wrong with Buffy?
My mother picked that name!
Oh, don't you start on my mother!
Xander, calm down. If you lost them,  we have a little time to figure this out.  Maybe it's related to Giles being blind.  ANYA Giles is blind?
Spike's right. We have to get organized.
Spike and I are getting married.
(equally intimate) The man I love.
(through the kiss) What about Willow? Get off me,  Honey.
We're all tired of it, but what's it have  to do with what's going on?
She did a spell.
And both you guys were affected.  I probably only escaped it because  I'm the Slayer. Some kind of natural  immunity.
Xander...
Before someone really gets hurt.
Xander, Spike is going to be my husband.  I want him included.
Spike, these are my friends. And, by  the way, this is kind of my job.
What are you saying, you want me  to stop working?
This was burned.
Who?
Shut up, Honey.
Why would he attack Willow?
Meaning?
Oh god, Willow... so you can summon  the demon from this crypt place? Get  him to stop- (without slowing) hey, wouldn't this make a pretty back  drop for photographs?
Listen, we're gonna do this without  destroying the foliage.
(bristling) You think you have to protect me?
Honey!
Spike, are you okay?
Spike lips, lips of Spikeâ€¦
Better?
It'll happen.
No.
You're a pig.
That was the spell.
We may be into a forgetting spell  later. I loved him. We were betrothed.
We weren't! It wasn't even nice. The  bad boy thing? Over it. I get it now.  I'd be really happy to be in a nice  relationship with a decent reliable  oh my GOD Riley thinks I'm engaged.
(hyperventilating) Riley. He saw me... and.. What the hell  am I gonna say to him?
You thought I was serious?
Oh , God. Right. I'm marrying a guy named Spike.
No, no... It's just - I saw that fear in  your eyes when you caught me looking  at wedding dresses, and I had to give you  a hard time.
Yes you did. You were looking at me  like I was a cartoon ball and chain.
(is this working?) Uh huh...
Uh huh...
Yes.
You've got a lot to learn about women.
