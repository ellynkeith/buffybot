There you go. Looks good.
What?  (gets it) Oh. Yes, I am a lesbian.
They just want me to be happy.  Oh hey! You know we were talking  about having a picnic; I was thinking,  do you ever hang out at Ruggs Field?  It's beautiful there. Usually not that  crowded either. I thought maybe we  could have a little spread, sandwiches,  maybe some ants. (they stop) Could be fun.
Oh. Um, okay... (thinking) ... so was that a conversation we  actually had or just one I was  practicing?
Okay, yes, I have been known to do  a little prep work before our  conversations. It's not easy, you know.  Talking to you, sometimes, it's like  an oral exam.
Well you're tricky!
I never know how you're going to  react to something. That's why I  like you so much. You're a mystery. (laughs a bit) Probably every beautiful girl in the  world has some jerk telling her  she's a mystery, but I swear you really  are. There's a lot about you that  needs puzzling out.
Say. Don'tchya just love a picnic?
Yeah.
Not four-wheeling or anything.  But yeah. Don't you?
You're kidding, right? I mean you  know how to drive.
That's just cause you haven't had a  good experience yet. You can have  the best time in a car. It's not about  getting somewhere - you have to  take your time, forget about everything.  You just relax... let it wash over you,  the air, the motion... you just let it roll.
I thought I was... (gathering himself) I'm taking you. Some night when  it's warm, up past the vineyards...  change everything for you.
Hi Willow.
Wait. (Willow turns back) Sit. Plenty to go around.
Yeah, guess they do that.
Hey, Buffy . What's up?
Um, yeah, they're nice. A little dressy,  maybe, for school, but...
(confusion) Buffy...
Different then what?
The day when...
The wedding! What wedding?
I don't think "no" is a strong enough  word.
No.
Can we start again?
I'd just like to clear up a few things -
Buffy.
Who?
What's his name?
The groom.
That's a name?
I'm not mad.
No, I am. I really - wow. Who is this  guy? Does he go here?
Old?
Okay. It's late. And I'm very tired now,  so... I'm going to go far away, and  be... away.
(firmly) No. (leaving) Stay.
Well... no. I mean - you weren't serious?
Maybe. We haven't known each other that long.
What? I didn't have fear in my eyes.
So you decided to tell me you were  getting married.
So.... you're insane.
But you're still single.
Okay then. Just another piece of the  Buffy puzzle.
You're gonna teach me.
