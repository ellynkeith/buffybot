Zippo. Patrol has been totally uneventful. My kill count's been way down. 
She's got a point. It's not much to  go on.
Keep an eye out for threatening scenarios?
So are you <u>here</u>, here - or just passing through?
Are you okay?
Yeah. Oz and Willow had a -
It's no fun when they're that easy.
Anytime.
Right. They had a rough break-up. Some stuff came up and Oz bailed, like overnight. The whole thing left Will pretty devastated.
Yeah. And before that they were doing great, too. Totally dealing with Oz being a werewolf and - 
Right. Important detail. He got bit a couple of years back. Anyway - 
Well, yeah. Hence the high emotion.
(growing defensive) It wasn't like he was bad all the time.  He only changed three nights a month.  I mean, besides the wolf thing, Oz  is a great guy.
(offended) What kind of girl?
Oz is <u>not</u> dangerous. Something happened to him that wasn't his fault. God, I never knew you were  such a bigot.
(angrily) Love isn't logical, Rye. People can't  just be Joe Sensible about it.  God knows I haven't been.
How 'bout we don't talk about it at all? Let's just patrol.
Morning.
Right. And then you have your perfectly balanced breakfast and call your mother.
I'm not pissed off. Keep push-upping. (he does/irked) I just wish you were more spontaneous sometimes.
Sorry. I feel all itchy and cranky.  It'd be better if I just go.
I don't know. Maybe.
I know. But you sounded like Mr.  Initiative. "Demons bad. People good."
Well, yeah. There's degrees of ...
It's different with different demons.  There's creatures... vampires, for  example, that aren't evil at all.
(avoids it) The point is, every relationship has  issues. Willow fell for Oz before he  was even bit. It's always more  complicated than -
What kind of demons...
Hey.
I just... don't really feel like talking  about it. I want to hear about you  and Oz. You saw him, right?
All night? Oh my God -  (realizes) Wait. Last night was a wolf moon, wasn't it?
So... You're about to tell me something incredibly kinky, or -
Again - Oh my God! I can't believe it! (stops) Okay. I just noticed I'm all with the "woo hoo" - and you're not.
Why complicated? You got your boyfriend back.
(confused) You mean Tara has a crush on Oz? (off Willow's look) No, not - (getting it) Oh. <u>Ohh</u>.
Well, there you go then. You have  to follow your heart, Will. I mean,  that's what's important, Will.
Like what, Will?
What? No, Wi- No! Absolutely no to  that question. I'm glad you told me. (then) What did you say to Oz?
Yeah. I do.
No matter what happens, somebody's going to get hurt. The main thing  is, you have to be honest - or it'll be a lot worse.
(shakes her head) He's still not answering his page. I left him a message.
We've got to move fast, so we'll make a plan without Riley. (off their looks) And hope he calls.
We're going to need some kind of cover. If there was a way we could kill the electricity down there...
(checking her watch) Something's wrong. Riley usually returns my calls by now.
I know. Okay. Xander, you and I will go in. We've done it before -
It's too dangerous, Will. Besides, we  need you to hack into the city's  electrical grid with Giles. We have  to try to power-down the Initiative.
Fine. You'll back us up. The only way  I know in is through the elevator at  Lowell House - and my clearance is  long gone.
Or someone formerly dangerous and currently annoying.
(disbelieving) Uh huh. What's the going rate on a wild goose chase, Spike?
I've mentioned how much I'm going to kill you if this is a scam, right?
You first.
You know who I am? (off his nod) Then you know I'm pretty good with this thing. Get dressed.
Riley? He tried to help Oz escape?
Talk, later. Stealth-y escape now.
Which one?
Was I the only one awake in English that day? (to the Commandos) I'll kill him!
Xand -
Plus - snake jerky. (then) I hope everybody else is okay. It was better to split up, right? It just seems like we're too  findable in a big clump.
Probably. What should we do?
Quite a day. Woke up to a big bowl  of Wheaties, now you're a fugitive.
True. But..
No you weren't. You were thrown. You found out Willow was in kind  of an unconventional relationship and it gave you a momentary wiggins. (thinking of Tara) It happens.
I gotta tell you some stuff. About my  past. It's not all stuff you're gonna like.
I think so. I think I can.
