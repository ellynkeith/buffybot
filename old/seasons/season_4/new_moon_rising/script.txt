TARA: Do you like cats?
WILLOW: More of a dog person, myself. But  I'm not like "Death to all cats!" Why? 
TARA: 'Cause I was thinking about getting one.
WILLOW: Can you have one in the dorms?
TARA: No. But this would be a sneaky cat. 
WILLOW: That would be cool. You mean it'd be sort of like a familiar?
TARA: Actually, I was thinking it'd be  sort of like a pet. You know - we could name her Trixie or... Miss Kitty Fantastico or something.
WILLOW: And we could make kitty go bonkers with string and cat nip and stuff?
TARA: Absolutely.
WILLOW: Fun. I'm in.
TARA: So - you're not allergic or anything?
WILLOW: Nope.
TARA: Good. 'Cause I want my room to be Willow-friendly.
WILLOW: Me too.
TARA: So I'm excited about the Scoobie meeting. . . I think. What's it about?
WILLOW: I'm not sure. Probably just your garden variety disaster.
BUFFY: Zippo. Patrol has been totally uneventful. My kill count's been way down. 
WILLOW: (to Tara/helpfully) She means that there's been less  bad guy activity.
GILES: (concerned) And we know what that often indicates.
XANDER: Buffy doesn't make her quota. (to Buffy) Bad slayer!
GILES: I wish it were that innocuous. But with Adam about, I fear he may be involved somehow.
WILLOW: (to Tara again) When things get slow it's usually  because something extra evil is brewing.
RILEY: Except the weird thing is we've been  busy at the Initiative. Our squads are  pulling a lot more captures; we've got  demons coming out of our ears.
WILLOW: (once again, to Tara) That's a metaphor - 
TARA: Got it. Thanks.
WILLOW: I'm over-helping, aren't I?
GILES: So activity hasn't stopped, just shifted. Fascinating...
ANYA: To an extremely bored person, maybe.  All you're really saying is - slow week  for Buffy. Busy week for Riley.  Pardon me if I delay my freak out until  we actually know something.
BUFFY: She's got a point. It's not much to  go on.
ANYA: See? Buffy agrees with me. (to Xander) Let's go to the movies.
GILES: (defensive) I confess- it could be nothing, but it  could also indicate any number of  threatening scenarios.
ANYA: Fine. What would you like us to do?
GILES: Well. I suppose you could... I think we should all -
BUFFY: Keep an eye out for threatening scenarios?
GILES: Precisely.
ANYA: Well - that was a thrilling hour.
GILES: I do not appreciate your snide remarks,  Anya. I have a great deal of experience  in these matters and when I tell you  I feel something of import brewing, I-I...
OZ: Hey.
WILLOW: Oz...
TARA: Oz?
WILLOW: (to Oz) When - When did you get back?
OZ: Pretty much now.
XANDER: Oz, man, hate to sound grandma but - you don't call, you don't write.
OZ: Yeah, sorry.
BUFFY: So are you <u>here</u>, here - or just passing through?
GILES: (before Oz can answer) Let's not bombard Oz with questions right off. (to Oz) Can I get you something? Some tea -
WILLOW: Tea? Now? With... Oz?
OZ: Thanks, but I'll pass.
WILLOW: I - I guess so.
OZ: I'll come by your place.
WILLOW: Okay.
OZ: It's good to see you guys. Really.
ANYA: Everyone's uncomfortable now.
BUFFY: Are you okay?
WILLOW: What? I - no...
TARA: I just... I realized... I'm late for  study group.
WILLOW: Tara - wait. 
TARA: It's okay. Y-you should be with your  friends. And I should go.
WILLOW: But -
TARA: Bye.
RILEY: So - I was missing something this afternoon, wasn't I? I mean, breakups  are tough - but when Oz walked in -  it seemed like emotions were running  extra high.
BUFFY: Yeah. Oz and Willow had a -
RILEY: (cutting her off) Hold that thought. 
BUFFY: It's no fun when they're that easy.
RILEY: Speak for yourself. (into walkie) Base, this is Agent Finn. We have an HST down. Please send a  retrieval team down to Sector 72.
VOICE: No can do, Agent Finn. We're  swamped here. All the retrieval  units are in the field.
RILEY: All of them? So what am I supposed  to do with -
BUFFY: Anytime.
RILEY: Oz and Willow.
BUFFY: Right. They had a rough break-up. Some stuff came up and Oz bailed, like overnight. The whole thing left Will pretty devastated.
RILEY: I remember.
BUFFY: Yeah. And before that they were doing great, too. Totally dealing with Oz being a werewolf and - 
RILEY: (surprised) Whoa. Back up there. Werewolf?
BUFFY: Right. Important detail. He got bit a couple of years back. Anyway - 
RILEY: Oz is a werewolf and Willow was  <u>dating</u> him?
BUFFY: Well, yeah. Hence the high emotion.
RILEY: Man. You're kidding me.
BUFFY: (growing defensive) It wasn't like he was bad all the time.  He only changed three nights a month.  I mean, besides the wolf thing, Oz  is a great guy.
RILEY: That's a big "besides," Buffy. Gotta say. I'm surprised. I didn't think  Willow was that kind of girl.
BUFFY: (offended) What kind of girl?
RILEY: Into dangerous guys. She seems  smarter than that.
BUFFY: Oz is <u>not</u> dangerous. Something happened to him that wasn't his fault. God, I never knew you were  such a bigot.
RILEY: Whoah! How did we get to bigot? I'm just saying it's a little weird to  date anyone that tries to eat you  once a month.
BUFFY: (angrily) Love isn't logical, Rye. People can't  just be Joe Sensible about it.  God knows I haven't been.
RILEY: We're not talking about you - 
BUFFY: How 'bout we don't talk about it at all? Let's just patrol.
OZ: Hey.
WILLOW: Hey.
OZ: Actually, I want you to come out. I want to show you something.
WILLOW: (a little puzzled) Oh... Okay.
WILLOW: Oz. This is all so weird. I feel like  this isn't really happening. Like it's  a dream or something...
OZ: It's real. (then) Look up.
WILLOW: What?
OZ: Look at the sky.
WILLOW: Full moon...
OZ: Full moon.
WILLOW: (growing excited) Full moon! But how? I mean - you did it! How did you do it? Where did you go?
OZ: It's a long story -
WILLOW: Oh my God! Oz!
OZ: Willow -
WILLOW: This is... I mean, it's wonderful for you.
OZ: Will. I went through a lot of changes  while we were apart.
WILLOW: Yeah...I know the feeling.
OZ: And I want to hear everything. I want  to tell you everything. (then) But there's something, before all that.  I talked to Xander - and he said you  didn't have a new guy.
WILLOW: (awkwardly) No. No - new guy.
OZ: I know what I put you through. And I'm not going to push... But  I'm a different person than when  I left. I can be what you need  now. And that's what I want. That's why I'm here.
FORREST: Nothing. 
GRAHAM: Well something's out here. Charlie  Team just got another report of a  demon sighting in this sector.
FORREST: So let's split up. We can cover  more ground. Maybe get home  before breakfast.
GRAHAM: Sounds like a plan.
SOLDIER: Sir...
JAPE: Three down. Six billion to go, give  or take. I told you those demons  could get it done.
ADAM: They were efficient.
JAPE: Efficient? They were death on legs.  You're telling me it's not enough?
ADAM: It's not enough.
WILLOW: (re: sari) I love this.
OZ: A woman in Tibet traded it to me for a Radiohead CD. I got a lot  of mileage out of the barter system.
WILLOW: So Tibet was your favorite?
OZ: It's where I stayed the longest. This warlock in Romania sent me  to the monks there, to learn some  meditation techniques. It was intense.  All about keeping your inner cool.
WILLOW: (teasing) Good. 'Cause you were such a spaz before. (then) So that's it? You keep your cool and no more wolf?
OZ: There's more. I take some herbs and  stuff, some chanting, couple charms.
WILLOW: It's incredible. You've been all over  the world. You've had this complete mind/body transformation... And I've  just been - here. Same old Sunnydale.
OZ: That doesn't mean you haven't gone through a lot.
WILLOW: That's true. I passed poly-sci.
OZ: I'm serious. (off her silence) But if you don't want to talk about it...
WILLOW: Well, some of it, you know, was me telling myself I hated you and cursing your name. (quickly) Not literally.
OZ: Thanks for that.
WILLOW: (nods/then) And...I don't know...I think I'm  getting better with my spells and  stuff. I have a friend, we kind of  help each other...
OZ: Almost eight. We talked all night.
WILLOW: I used to tell people we did that  sometimes, but nobody believed  you knew that many words.  (then) I believe a manly-sized breakfast is in order, don't you?
OZ: Or we could sleep for a while.
WILLOW: I think... I'll have the less confusing  waffles right now.
OZ: Breakfast it is then.
WILLOW: Just let me freshen up. O.J. without  the yummy toothpaste flavor just  isn't the same.
TARA: Oh... Sorry. I'll come back.
OZ: Are you looking for Willow? 'Cause  she's just down in the bathroom.
TARA: N-no... That's okay.
OZ: I saw you at Giles' yesterday.
TARA: Yeah. Sometimes Willow takes me with her to the S-scoobies...
OZ: You sure you don't want to come in?
WILLOW: What?
OZ: Your friend came by. The blonde girl? But she wouldn't stay.
RILEY: Morning.
BUFFY: Morning.
RILEY: (still going) No. I do them because it's a good way to start the day.
BUFFY: Right. And then you have your perfectly balanced breakfast and call your mother.
RILEY: Okay. I've been up less than a  minute and somehow, I've managed  to piss you off.
BUFFY: I'm not pissed off. Keep push-upping. (he does/irked) I just wish you were more spontaneous sometimes.
RILEY: (gets up) I am spontaneous. I was going  to do jumping jacks...
BUFFY: Sorry. I feel all itchy and cranky.  It'd be better if I just go.
RILEY: No... Come on. Is this about that whole  Willow thing last night?
BUFFY: I don't know. Maybe.
RILEY: Look, I only said what I said because  I'm concerned. I don't want her to  get hurt.
BUFFY: I know. But you sounded like Mr.  Initiative. "Demons bad. People good."
RILEY: Something wrong with that theorem?
BUFFY: Well, yeah. There's degrees of ...
RILEY: Evil.
BUFFY: It's different with different demons.  There's creatures... vampires, for  example, that aren't evil at all.
RILEY: Name one.
BUFFY: (avoids it) The point is, every relationship has  issues. Willow fell for Oz before he  was even bit. It's always more  complicated than -
RILEY: Yeah. Come in.
FORREST: Rye, need you downstairs. Beta  team got hit.
RILEY: Bad?
FORREST: We lost Willis.
RILEY: Graham.
FORREST: He's walking. We're going on a hunt.
BUFFY: What kind of demons...
RILEY: (bitterly) Does it matter?
BUFFY: Hey.
WILLOW: Hey. You okay?
BUFFY: I just... don't really feel like talking  about it. I want to hear about you  and Oz. You saw him, right?
WILLOW: I was with him all night.
BUFFY: All night? Oh my God -  (realizes) Wait. Last night was a wolf moon, wasn't it?
WILLOW: Yep.
BUFFY: So... You're about to tell me something incredibly kinky, or -
WILLOW: No kink. He didn't change, Buffy. He said he was going to find a cure,  and he did. In Tibet. 
BUFFY: Again - Oh my God! I can't believe it! (stops) Okay. I just noticed I'm all with the "woo hoo" - and you're not.
WILLOW: No - there's "woo" <u>and</u> "hoo". But  there's also - "uh oh". And "why now?" And... it's complicated.
BUFFY: Why complicated? You got your boyfriend back.
WILLOW: It's complicated - because of Tara.
BUFFY: (confused) You mean Tara has a crush on Oz? (off Willow's look) No, not - (getting it) Oh. <u>Ohh</u>.
WILLOW: She is. And there's something between us... I wasn't looking for it, you know. It's just totally  powerful. And it's totally different  than what Oz and I had.
BUFFY: Well, there you go then. You have  to follow your heart, Will. I mean,  that's what's important, Will.
WILLOW: How come you keep saying my name like that?
BUFFY: Like what, Will?
WILLOW: Are you freaked?
BUFFY: What? No, Wi- No! Absolutely no to  that question. I'm glad you told me. (then) What did you say to Oz?
WILLOW: I was going to tell him... But then we  hung out and I could feel everything  coming back. He's Oz, you know.
BUFFY: Yeah. I do.
WILLOW: (pained) I don't want to hurt anybody, Buffy.  I think of either of them and I can't  stand it. 
BUFFY: No matter what happens, somebody's going to get hurt. The main thing  is, you have to be honest - or it'll be a lot worse.
SPIKE: (eyes still closed) From the sound of those massive mud  flaps I'd peg you as a demon, which  means you're in for a world of - 
ADAM: Spike. I want you to come with me.
SPIKE: Do you? Let's go then.
ADAM: Come. You're going to help me with my problem.
SPIKE: Why is that, exactly?
ADAM: I'm going to help you with yours.
WILLOW: Hi.
TARA: Hi.
WILLOW: I can only stay a minute, I have class.
TARA: Me too. I have class too.
WILLOW: I just wanted to let you know, what  you saw this morning, it wasn't -
TARA: (cutting her off) It's okay. I always knew, if he  came back -
WILLOW: We just talked. Nothing happened.
TARA: Oh. Really?
WILLOW: (nods) But, you know, it was intense. Just  talking. We have a lot to talk about. (then) I kind of feel like my head's going  to explode.
TARA: Whatever, you know, happens? I'll still be here. I mean, I'll still be your  friend.
WILLOW: (alarmed) Of course we'll be friends. That's not  even a question.
TARA: But I'm saying, I know what Oz means to you...
WILLOW: How can you, when I'm not even sure? I mean, I know what he <u>meant</u> to me. But he left. And everything changed. I changed. And then we...
TARA: It's okay.
WILLOW: It's not okay. I mean, Tara, the time we spend together is...
TARA: What?
WILLOW: I don't know. It's just - life was  starting to get so good again, and  you're a big part of that. And here  comes the thing I wanted most of all. (a little desperate) And I don't know what to do. I  want to know. But I don't. 
TARA: Do what makes you h-happy.
OZ: Willow?
TARA: Hey. (notices his papers) You're coming back to school here?
OZ: (smiles) Pretty much. I'm feeling oddly motivated.
TARA: That - that's great. I mean, it's  great for you and Willow, right?
OZ: I hope so.
TARA: Good. That's...Because, really, you two belong together. I think it's for the b-best...
OZ: Is that Willow's?
TARA: I hope you'll be v-v-very -
OZ: You smell like her. She's all over you, you know that?
TARA: I can't. I can't talk about th- th..
OZ: But there's something to talk about -
TARA: I-I have to g-g-g-
OZ: We talked all night and she never said anything. Nothing. I -
TARA: B-b-back demon... In the-the name of Th-th-
FORREST: Are you okay?
TARA: (nods) Where are you... what's going on?
FORREST: We'll take it from here.
RILEY: (hard) So we'll take it back and make an I.D.  If it is, we'll put him down.
TARA: You don't understand. That's a p-p-p-
FORREST: Listen, we know what we're doing.  You just need to calm down, okay? You're in shock. Go outside and get some air. (Before she can speak he turns to the others) Let's move!
SPIKE: Well. That sounds like a lot of fun.
ADAM: I think so too. 
JAPE: Yeah! Count me in for the crazy fun plan!
ADAM: You see my problem, though. Total annihilation of the humans doesn't help me. I'll be needing heavy casualties  on both sides.
SPIKE: I get that. I'm still not sure how the Slayer fits in.
ADAM: The humans need a leader. A champion.  The Slayer can do that -- can even the  odds. And she holds influence over Riley.
SPIKE: Yeah. Thing about the Slayer is, she's  a whiney little thing, but when it comes  to the fighting she does have a slight  tendency to win. 
ADAM: Then I guess you should be on her side.
SPIKE: This all goes down, the chip comes out, yeah? No tricks?
ADAM: (holds up hand) Scout's honor.
SPIKE: You were a Boy Scout?
ADAM: Parts of me. 
WILLOW: What's up? Are you okay?
TARA: Oz.. We were talking and he - he changed. Right in front of me.
WILLOW: (alarmed) What? It's day time...
TARA: I know, but it happened.
WILLOW: Oh, God... Are you alright?
TARA: I'm fine. Riley and the commando guys - they stopped him, but they don't know it's Oz. I tried to tell them, but they took him away.
WILLOW: When? Just now?
TARA: (nods) I think they might hurt him. 
WILLOW: I have to go. I have to find Buffy.
TARA: I know.
WILLOW: Tara said they took him right before  she found me.
ANYA: So that's good, right? They probably  haven't had time to eviscerate him yet.
XANDER: (to Anya) You can help by making this a  quiet moment, An. 
GILES: Again we're faced with the daunting  prospect of infiltrating the Initiative...
XANDER: Wouldn't it be great if one of us  were dating a man on the inside, someone with connections...
BUFFY: (shakes her head) He's still not answering his page. I left him a message.
WILLOW: So what do we do?
BUFFY: We've got to move fast, so we'll make a plan without Riley. (off their looks) And hope he calls.
FORREST: What's the word, Doc? Is this the animal who took apart our men?
RILEY: What's the hold up? I thought Graham gave you a full description.
RILEY: And how long's that going to take?
RILEY: I don't need a bunch of tests to know  this thing's a killer. So why don't  you back off -
BUFFY: We're going to need some kind of cover. If there was a way we could kill the electricity down there...
GILES: And you'll need to tranquilize Oz.
XANDER: What's with the wolf in the day bit anyway? Isn't that a big no-no in the werewolf handbook?
WILLOW: He said he was controlling it with  herbs and some kind of meditation... (guiltily) What if he got upset and lost control of himself? Could the wolf come out during the day?
GILES: If he'd managed to repress the beast for months? I suppose it could reach a point where it overflowed in him, regardless of time of day or month...
RILEY: (cutting him off) He's coming to. Oz?
RILEY: (angered) Why? The guy's not a threat now.
RILEY: That's enough! This guy's a student.  I know him!
BUFFY: (checking her watch) Something's wrong. Riley usually returns my calls by now.
XANDER: We can't wait much longer.
BUFFY: I know. Okay. Xander, you and I will go in. We've done it before -
ANYA: Can I just ask? What's the deal? I  mean, this guy hurt Willow, he's in  town for one day - and you're all  willing to go off and die for him?
WILLOW: (angered) The deal is, he's my - (catches herself) He was my boyfriend and none of this is his fault. (to Buffy) I'm going with you.
BUFFY: It's too dangerous, Will. Besides, we  need you to hack into the city's  electrical grid with Giles. We have  to try to power-down the Initiative.
WILLOW: Giles can do it without me. I can't  just sit here.
BUFFY: Fine. You'll back us up. The only way  I know in is through the elevator at  Lowell House - and my clearance is  long gone.
XANDER: So we grab a guy, make him take us.
GILES: How'd you get in?
SPIKE: Door was unlocked. Might want to  watch that, Rupert, someone  dangerous could get in.
BUFFY: Or someone formerly dangerous and currently annoying.
SPIKE: Now, now. None of that - or I won't  help you get Red's mongrel back. (to Willow) Bad news travels fast with us demons. We all like a good laugh.
GILES: Out of cash again, Spike?
SPIKE: I happen to be seeking monetary gratification, yeah. But I also get a  kick outta jacking up those  army ginks myself.
BUFFY: (disbelieving) Uh huh. What's the going rate on a wild goose chase, Spike?
SPIKE: Fine, if you're not interested... But I was stuck in that hole,  remember? And I hear things from other guys who've made it out. I can get you in, no alarms, no  cameras - no waiting.
RILEY: Come on.
OZ: Where are you taking me?
RILEY: To Giles and Buffy. They'll know how to help you.
FORREST: End of the line.
MCNAMARA: At ease.
RILEY: Permission to speak, Colonel.
MCNAMARA: Denied. (then) Being new around here, Finn, I had a look at your record and Professor Walsh's notes. Until recently you were an exemplary soldier, headed straight for the top, are you aware of that?
RILEY: Sir, the prisoner is a - 
MCNAMARA: (hard) You'll speak when I tell you to. (then) Tomorrow I'm going to institute a court martial, investigating the extent of your involvement with the Slayer and her band of freaks. They're anarchists, Finn, too  backward for the real world.
BUFFY: I've mentioned how much I'm going to kill you if this is a scam, right?
SPIKE: (re: soldier clothes) Look - would I wear this if I wasn't on the up and up?
WILLOW: You do sort of look like an evil olive...
XANDER: Guys - check it out...
SPIKE: For a nasty town like Sunnydale, nobody seems to mind their locks.
BUFFY: You first.
GILES: (to Anya) Try typing XH4J7 for the emergency shutdown command. That covers the entire electrical grid for the university  and outlying areas.
ANYA: (pleased) Slap my hand now. (off his look) In celebration.
GILES: Oh.
BUFFY: You know who I am? (off his nod) Then you know I'm pretty good with this thing. Get dressed.
NAMARA: (cutting her off) Finn stays in the brig. Helping an  HST escape is a court-martial offense  and you're only gonna --
BUFFY: Riley? He tried to help Oz escape?
NAMARA: That's who you came for. The wolf.
XANDER: Guess we're two for one.
RILEY: How did you-
BUFFY: Talk, later. Stealth-y escape now.
RILEY: Buffy, I leave now, I can't ever come back.
BUFFY: Which one?
XANDER: You'll...bore him to death with free prose?
BUFFY: Was I the only one awake in English that day? (to the Commandos) I'll kill him!
WILLOW: Oz...
OZ: Will, get back.
BUFFY: Xand -
OZ: Don't... Please.
GRAHAM: This can't end well, man.
RILEY: You gonna start killing people?
FORREST: I'm thinking just one.
RILEY: You and me trained together from  day one, Forrest. But I always  outranked you. Come after me,  you're gonna find out why.
NAMARA: You're a dead man, Finn.
RILEY: No sir - I'm an anarchist.
RILEY: This will work. Certainly off the beaten path.
BUFFY: Plus - snake jerky. (then) I hope everybody else is okay. It was better to split up, right? It just seems like we're too  findable in a big clump.
RILEY: It's better. Besides, I think it's mostly  me the Initiative wants now.
BUFFY: Probably. What should we do?
RILEY: We'll be safe for tonight at least. The campus is still blacked out, which ought to slow the Initiative down. I'll  figure out my next move tomorrow.
BUFFY: Quite a day. Woke up to a big bowl  of Wheaties, now you're a fugitive.
RILEY: Could be worse. At least I've got a  hotty girlfriend to keep me warm  on the lam.
BUFFY: True. But..
RILEY: Seriously? I don't know. I'm sorry it  had to end that way. But I'm glad it's  done. I'm glad to know where I stand, finally. (then) I was wrong about Oz. I <u>was</u> being  a bigot. 
BUFFY: No you weren't. You were thrown. You found out Willow was in kind  of an unconventional relationship and it gave you a momentary wiggins. (thinking of Tara) It happens.
RILEY: Still, I was in a totally black and  white space. People versus monsters.  Ain't like that. Especially when it  comes to love.
BUFFY: I gotta tell you some stuff. About my  past. It's not all stuff you're gonna like.
RILEY: You can tell me anything.
BUFFY: I think so. I think I can.
WILLOW: (re: van) This thing looks pretty good considering you drove it overseas.
OZ: It broke down outside of Mexico. I traded my bass to have it fixed and garaged. (frustrated) I shouldn't have come back now. I thought I'd changed...
WILLOW: You have changed. You stopped the wolf from coming out - I saw it. 
OZ: But I couldn't look at you. It  turns out the one thing that brings  it on, is you. Which falls under the heading of ironic in my book.
WILLOW: It was my fault. I upset you.
OZ: So we're safe then, 'cause you'll never do that again.
WILLOW: When you spoke to Tara...
OZ: I knew.
WILLOW: I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted was -
OZ: It's - it's okay. (then) But you're happy?
WILLOW: (realizes) I am. I can't explain it-
OZ: Maybe safer for both of us if you don't.
WILLOW: I missed you, Oz. I wrote you so many letters - but I didn't have  any place to send them, you know? I couldn't live like that.
OZ: It was stupid to think you'd just be waiting.
WILLOW: I was waiting. I feel like some part of me will always be waiting for you. Like, if I'm old and blue-haired and I turn a corner in Istanbul and there you are - I won't be surprised. Because you're there with me - you know?
OZ: I know. (with difficulty) But now's not that time, I guess.
WILLOW: No. (then) What are you going to do?
OZ: I think I'd better take off.
WILLOW: When?
OZ: Pretty much now.
WILLOW: No candles? Well I brought one -- it's extra flamey.
TARA: I understand. You have to be with the person you l-love.
WILLOW: I am.
TARA: You mean --
WILLOW: I mean.
TARA: Oh yes.
WILLOW: I feel horrible about everything I put you through. I'm gonna make it up, too. Starting right now.
TARA: (softly) Right now?
