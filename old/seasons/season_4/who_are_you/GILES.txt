Buffy. Good.
It's about Faith, not surprisingly.
Unless I'm mistaken, Faith is no longer in police custody.
The Watcher's Council.
Yes, those "geeks" have sent a retrieval team to capture Faith.
They sent an operations team. They handle the council's trickier jobs. Smuggling, interrogation, wetworks.
They've never had a contract on a <b>human</b> that I know of, but in the world of international sorcery, things get… complicated. It's not all pointy hats and purple cloaks, as I'm sure you well know.
It'll be a long long time before she returns -- if she ever does at all.
I'm not sure there IS a book for something like this.
Yes.
I thought it would be best for us to convene, just in case there were any loose ends or problems we haven't thought of yet. But if I'm keeping you…

We still have Adam to worry about.
I wish we knew.
God --
Really.
Because the resemblance is striking.
No I wasn't.
I know what you're going to say and --

(thinks, then:) Who is president!?!
Yes. Right. Um…
(probing) How did I turn into a demon?
Actually, I beg you to stop.
All right. Let's… I want you to explain everything.
Yes of course. Just give me a minute to --
She understands it better than I do…
Yes. Of course I would have… had I known, I…
…Yes, Buffy's here with me. In fact, she -- Oh. Right.
Dammit man, we have to get inside! Our… families are in there! Our mothers and tiny babies, for the love of God man, we have to do something! What if it was <u>your</u> tiny baby, could you stand by and wait? No!
