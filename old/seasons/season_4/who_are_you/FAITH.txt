For murder.
She's not a kid. (off his look) I just mean, she's strong.
She truly is.
Oh. You know, she's a nut job.
How do you know she got drove?  Maybe she just likes being that way.
Well, could be things are looking up. I mean, little stint in the pokey, show her the error and all that. I'm  sure there's some big ol' Bertha just waiting to shower her ripe little self with affection.
I'm sorry, Mom, I just… When I think about how she mighta hurt you, I… I can't stand it.
Nah, I'm just… I'm sore from the fight.
Cuz I haven't visited you, right? I <u>knew</u> it!
Yeah, I'm a busy little beaver. College and all.
Count on it.
Why yes, I would be Buffy, may I  help you? (beat) Buffy buffy buffy buffy buffy buffy.
Okay… not too bad…
Six four four seven. Yeah. Expiration, five oh two. Okay.
Just gettin' my mail.
Yeah. I got some time to kill. I'll go see the gang. All my friends.
Yeah. Harlot.
Burn it.
Wow, Scooby gang's all here. Willow, Xander, and…
Didn't Joyce tell you? I already kicked that ass.
Going to the big house. Cops took her off my hands about an hour ago. Poetic justice.
Well, she did all those crimes, and now she's being arrested… I guess that's just regular justice. Anyway, it's cool.
What are you talking about?
Those geeks?
Yeah, 'cause that worked so well when Wesley tried it.
So the Watcher's Council has assassins on payroll? Sweet buncha guys.
And they're taking her to England?
I'm sorry… it's just, I'm happy… Faith is so evil, and evil is… wrong. I'm glad she's going. To England.
I forgot how much you don't like Faith.
I bet I know what Faith would say to that.
I would never let her hurt you.
Well we certainly don't want to cut into THAT seven minutes.
Lighten up. We're out of danger, everything's good.
Yeah, Adam… (no clue) …what's up with him?
Yeah… Well, don't sweat it. I'll patrol tonight, as long as it takes. You guys have your fun. I'll be out there, doing my job.
(searching) And you…
(nonchalantly cool) Um, do I… usually give you a hard time?
You're a vampire.
Okay.
Spike… (sizes him up) Spike. William the Bloody, with a  chip in his head. I kind of love this town.
I'm a stuck up tight-ass with no sense of fun?
'Cause I could do anything I want  and instead I just pout and whine  and feel the burden of slayerness? I mean, I could be rich, I could be famous, I could have anything. Anyone. (her tone becomes intimate, hypnotic) Even you, Spike. I could ride you at a gallop till your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up, I've got muscles you've never even dreamed of, I could squeeze you till you popped like warm champagne and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more and you know why I don't?
Count on it.
Chug! Chug!
Back off. You're nothing but a disappointment.
Willow. And…
So we've never met. (Tara shakes her head) Okay. Cool. I'm having a thing with names.
Uh huh?
I got tired. The whole Faith thing…  I wanted to let off some steam.
That's my philosophy.
You guys have been hanging out a lot, huh?
So Willow not driving stick anymore. Who woulda thought? Guess you never know a person till you've been inside their skin.
He www? You gonna get that sentence out sometime tonight?
Oh yeah. Good call.
He's wicked obvious.
I got it.
Picking on poor defenseless women, well that really gets my dander up.
Well he's gone now. Put some… medicine on that.
Yeah, it's cool.
All's well in the world.
(amused, mock  sincerity) Yeah. You give her whatever she needs.
Hi baby.
You miss me?
Everything's great.
Faith has won a fabulous trip to England, and I got the consolation prize. Which is you.
Oh, you wouldn't have liked Faith. She's not proper and joyless like a girl should be. She has a tendency to give in to her animal instincts.
So?
They might learn something.
Well why don't we give you a test drive.
How do you want me?
What do you want to do with this body? What nasty little desire have you been itching to try out? Am I a bad girl? Do you wanna hurt me?
I'm Buffy.
Hey, if you don't wanna play --
No… No… Get --
Who are you? What do you want from her?
This is meaningless.
Nothing.
What?
I think maybe you should stay out of other people's lives.
You've got a mission? I've been fighting demons since before you could shave.
I'm not a killer! I'm a slayer. You don't know the first thing about me.
No, I… I don't care. God. I don't care…
How many are in there?
I can do three.
How'd <u>you</u> respond so fast?
The troops get here, you send 'em in, But I'm going.
Don't tell me what to do! I'm Buffy, I… This is what I have to do.
I can't use you.
Well, I'm not the cops. I just come to pray.
You're not gonna kill these people.
Because it's wrong.
The one and only.
Simple deal. You let everyone go, I let you walk. If I were you, I'd think about it. This offer is not available in stores.
Then let these people go, and you can all three take me on.
Shut up! You think I'm afraid of you? You're nothing!
