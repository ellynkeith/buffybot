It's good you called. We've been looking for this girl since she broke out of the hospital.
We'll take her to the hospital under heavy guard, get her checked out.  If she's in stable condition, she  goes to jail pending trial.
And assaultâ€¦ She's got a lot to answer for.
First thing is to keep her from hurting anybody else.
(starting to go) Thank you both. I'm glad we  finally got the kid.
Yeah. This Faith chick: definitely dangerous.
Hold her --
Keep holding her.
She's coming to the station.
She's healthy as a deeply psychotic horse. How long will that sedative work?
I'm taking her. She's gonna wake up somewhere she can't walk out of.
She's coming to. Man, I want this kid's constitution.
Let's move it. I want to get her in before she's a hundred percent.
