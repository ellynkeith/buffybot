I wonder where she is.
Yeah. I wish she'd make a move. She's making my stomach all acidy.
I think so, but… that doesn't mean Faith won't hurt someone else.
Hey…
Tara, I never… I mean, it's not like I don't want my friends to know you, it's just…
I should check in with Giles, get a situation update.
What.
Where is she?
What's wetworks?
Yeah. I hope they throw the book at her.
They could throw other things.
After what she's done to you? I just wish those council guys would give me an hour alone in the room with her… If I was larger and had grenades.
What's up?
I know.
I can't believe you've never been here. The Bronze is the coolest place in Sunnydale. Course, not a lot of competition there… I think the vending machine at Burgin's  came in second.
Lived here. Me, Xander and… Buffy…
Wow, I didn't think she'd be here…
Hey, Buff!
Buffy, this is Tara.
Tara was in my wicca group.
So what's going on? Patrol no go?
Good for you. You can't work yourself too hard.
Anybody wanna soda?
Buff. Guy in the corner.
Vampire.
You want help?
Everything poofed?
Tara's not feeling great, I'm gonna walk her home.
Are you gonna be in later, or are you going over to Riley's?
I'm sorry you're feeling blechy. But we'll get together with Buffy another time, some time soon. I really think you'll like her --
I may have overestimated the "you liking her" factor. But I wish you'd give her a chance; she's very important to me.
You lost me.
You think Buffy's not herself? Like she's possessed or something?
You didn't sense a hyena energy at all did you? Hyena possession is just unpleasant.
Of Buffy's? Uh, uh, Ooh! Ah! (fingering them) Earrings!
If it'll help Buffy…
I trust you.
I trust you.
Giles!
Oh my god.
You're Buffy. You and Faith switched bodies, probably through a Draconian Katra spell.
Tara. Tara this is Buffy, only really this time.
Tara's a really powerful witch --
No really, and she knew right away that you weren't you so we connected with the nether realm and found out what had happened and then we conjured this.
(nodding) It's a Katra -- or, the home-conjured version. It should switch you back, if you can get hold of Faith.
But we have to get inside --
