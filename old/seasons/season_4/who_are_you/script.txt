CLARK: It's good you called. We've been looking for this girl since she broke out of the hospital.
JOYCE: What's going to happen to her?
CLARK: We'll take her to the hospital under heavy guard, get her checked out.  If she's in stable condition, she  goes to jail pending trial.
FAITH: For murder.
CLARK: And assault… She's got a lot to answer for.
JOYCE: I just hope she can get some kind of help.
CLARK: First thing is to keep her from hurting anybody else.
JOYCE: Of course.
CLARK: (starting to go) Thank you both. I'm glad we  finally got the kid.
FAITH: She's not a kid. (off his look) I just mean, she's strong.
CLARK: Yeah. This Faith chick: definitely dangerous.
FAITH: She truly is.
JOYCE: Faith.
FAITH: Oh. You know, she's a nut job.
JOYCE: I just don't understand what could drive a person to that kind of behavior.
FAITH: How do you know she got drove?  Maybe she just likes being that way.
JOYCE: I'll never believe that. I think she's horribly unhappy.
FAITH: Well, could be things are looking up. I mean, little stint in the pokey, show her the error and all that. I'm  sure there's some big ol' Bertha just waiting to shower her ripe little self with affection.
JOYCE: Buffy!
FAITH: I'm sorry, Mom, I just… When I think about how she mighta hurt you, I… I can't stand it.
JOYCE: I'm sorry…
FAITH: Nah, I'm just… I'm sore from the fight.
JOYCE: I've missed you.
FAITH: Cuz I haven't visited you, right? I <u>knew</u> it!
JOYCE: I know how it is… you have so much in your life now.
FAITH: Yeah, I'm a busy little beaver. College and all.
JOYCE: Of course. But maybe we could  spend a little time together soon.  Some night when I'm not being  held hostage by a raving psychotic.
FAITH: Count on it.
FAITH: Why yes, I would be Buffy, may I  help you? (beat) Buffy buffy buffy buffy buffy buffy.
BUFFY: Let go! Let me go!
DOCTOR: Get me a sedative NOW!
CLARK: Hold her --
BUFFY: I have to get home! She's with my mother! NO!
DOCTOR: Just lie still.
BUFFY: You don't understand…
CLARK: Keep holding her.
BUFFY: She took away my… my body…
CLARK: She's coming to the station.
DOCTOR: Are you nuts? She's been severely beaten, she was in a COMA, for God's sake.
CLARK: She's healthy as a deeply psychotic horse. How long will that sedative work?
DOCTOR: A couple of hours, but there's no way I'm releasing her to --
CLARK: I'm taking her. She's gonna wake up somewhere she can't walk out of.
WILLOW: I wonder where she is.
TARA: Who? Faith?
WILLOW: Yeah. I wish she'd make a move. She's making my stomach all acidy.
TARA: But you think Buffy can handle her.
WILLOW: I think so, but… that doesn't mean Faith won't hurt someone else.
TARA: Well you should be safe. Nobody knows you're here. I mean, they don't even know I exist, right?
WILLOW: Hey…
TARA: I mean that's totally fine. It's good. It's better.
WILLOW: Tara, I never… I mean, it's not like I don't want my friends to know you, it's just…
TARA: I do.
WILLOW: I should check in with Giles, get a situation update.
TARA: I am, you know.
WILLOW: What.
TARA: Yours.
FAITH: Okay… not too bad…
FAITH: Six four four seven. Yeah. Expiration, five oh two. Okay.
JOYCE: What are you doing?
FAITH: Just gettin' my mail.
JOYCE: Oh. That was Giles on the other line. He wanted you to meet your friends there, said he had news.
FAITH: Yeah. I got some time to kill. I'll go see the gang. All my friends.
JOYCE: Is that the "Harlot"?
FAITH: Yeah. Harlot.
JOYCE: That's the same one Faith picked.
FAITH: Burn it.
CLARK: She's coming to. Man, I want this kid's constitution.
BUFFY: Faith…
CLARK: Let's move it. I want to get her in before she's a hundred percent.
WEATHERBY: By order of the Watcher's Council, you are being taken into custody until such time --
COLLINS: Skip the speech. Let's go.
GILES: Buffy. Good.
FAITH: Wow, Scooby gang's all here. Willow, Xander, and…
GILES: It's about Faith, not surprisingly.
FAITH: Didn't Joyce tell you? I already kicked that ass.
XANDER: I feel a high five coming on…
WILLOW: Where is she?
FAITH: Going to the big house. Cops took her off my hands about an hour ago. Poetic justice.
ANYA: How's that?
FAITH: Well, she did all those crimes, and now she's being arrested… I guess that's just regular justice. Anyway, it's cool.
GILES: Unless I'm mistaken, Faith is no longer in police custody.
FAITH: What are you talking about?
GILES: The Watcher's Council.
FAITH: Those geeks?
GILES: Yes, those "geeks" have sent a retrieval team to capture Faith.
FAITH: Yeah, 'cause that worked so well when Wesley tried it.
GILES: They sent an operations team. They handle the council's trickier jobs. Smuggling, interrogation, wetworks.
WILLOW: What's wetworks?
XANDER: Scuba type stuff.
ANYA: I thought it was murder.
XANDER: Well, yeah, but, there could be, underwater… murder… with the snorkles…
FAITH: So the Watcher's Council has assassins on payroll? Sweet buncha guys.
GILES: They've never had a contract on a <b>human</b> that I know of, but in the world of international sorcery, things get… complicated. It's not all pointy hats and purple cloaks, as I'm sure you well know.
FAITH: And they're taking her to England?
GILES: It'll be a long long time before she returns -- if she ever does at all.
FAITH: I'm sorry… it's just, I'm happy… Faith is so evil, and evil is… wrong. I'm glad she's going. To England.
WILLOW: Yeah. I hope they throw the book at her.
GILES: I'm not sure there IS a book for something like this.
WILLOW: They could throw other things.
FAITH: I forgot how much you don't like Faith.
WILLOW: After what she's done to you? I just wish those council guys would give me an hour alone in the room with her… If I was larger and had grenades.
FAITH: I bet I know what Faith would say to that.
ANYA: So what you're saying is that everything's fine.
GILES: Yes.
ANYA: Well I'm glad that you called us all here because that information could never be conveyed by telephone.
GILES: I thought it would be best for us to convene, just in case there were any loose ends or problems we haven't thought of yet. But if I'm keeping you…
WILLOW: What's up?
FAITH: I would never let her hurt you.
WILLOW: I know.
GILES: …please, by all means, go.
XANDER: We kind of have a romantic evening planned.
ANYA: We're going to light a bunch of candles and have sex near them.
FAITH: Well we certainly don't want to cut into THAT seven minutes.
ANYA: Hey!
XANDER: I believe that's my "hey".
FAITH: Lighten up. We're out of danger, everything's good.
GILES: We still have Adam to worry about.
FAITH: Yeah, Adam… (no clue) …what's up with him?
GILES: I wish we knew.
FAITH: Yeah… Well, don't sweat it. I'll patrol tonight, as long as it takes. You guys have your fun. I'll be out there, doing my job.
SPIKE: Oh, you.
FAITH: (searching) And you…
SPIKE: What are you, keeping tabs on me? You gonna give me a hard time now?
FAITH: (nonchalantly cool) Um, do I… usually give you a hard time?
SPIKE: Very funny. Well you don't have to worry about me drinking. Unless you're here to protect innocent beers.
FAITH: You're a vampire.
SPIKE: Yeah, and as soon as I get this chip out of my head I'll be a vampire again but until then I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree so why don't you sod off and let me enjoy the lack of ambience?
FAITH: Okay.
SPIKE: Oh, fine! Throw it in my face! 'Spike's not a threat anymore, I'll just turn my back, he can't hurt me…'
FAITH: Spike… (sizes him up) Spike. William the Bloody, with a  chip in his head. I kind of love this town.
SPIKE: Gah! You know why I really hate  you, Summers?
FAITH: I'm a stuck up tight-ass with no sense of fun?
SPIKE: Wuh-yeah, that… covers a lot of it…
FAITH: 'Cause I could do anything I want  and instead I just pout and whine  and feel the burden of slayerness? I mean, I could be rich, I could be famous, I could have anything. Anyone. (her tone becomes intimate, hypnotic) Even you, Spike. I could ride you at a gallop till your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up, I've got muscles you've never even dreamed of, I could squeeze you till you popped like warm champagne and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more and you know why I don't?
SPIKE: I get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a confrontation.
FAITH: Count on it.
BOONE: It was too crowded. We gotta hold out a few hours, pick up a straggler, some drunk. Can't be calling attention to… ourselves…
ADAM: I've been thinking. About vampires.
BOONE: This is my place.
ADAM: Your place. Yes. The sewers. You hide from them, crawl about in their filth, scavenging like rats. What do you fear?
BOONE: Kill this guy already.
ADAM: You fear the cross. The sun. Fire.
BOONE: You can have this place, I mean we don't have to stay here anymore…
ADAM: You fear death. Being immortal, you fear it more than those to whom it comes naturally.
BOONE: Okay, we're a paradox, that's cool…
ADAM: Demon in a human body. You're a hybrid. Natural and unnatural. You walk in both worlds, and belong to neither.
WEATHERBY: Well, it's awake.
BUFFY: Who are you?
WEATHERBY: Council. We're taking you back to the mother country. Seems you've been a naughty girl.
BUFFY: Listen to me. You've made a mistake.
WEATHERBY: Threats, is it?
BUFFY: I'm not threatening you. Listen. I am not Faith.
COLLINS: Well. Our mistake then.
BUFFY: I'm Buffy Summers. Faith performed some kind of spell to switch our bodies.
COLLINS: Congratulations. No one's ever actually tried that one on me before.
BUFFY: You have to find Faith. Call Giles! Get him here.
COLLINS: Giles doesn't work for the Council anymore. For that matter, neither does Buffy Summers. What you are, miss, is the package. I deliver the package. I don't much care  what's inside. (to Weatherby) Come on.
WEATHERBY: He may not care, but I do. The Watcher's Council used to mean something. You perverted it. You trash. We should have killed you while you were asleep.
WILLOW: I can't believe you've never been here. The Bronze is the coolest place in Sunnydale. Course, not a lot of competition there… I think the vending machine at Burgin's  came in second.
TARA: You used to come here a lot?
WILLOW: Lived here. Me, Xander and… Buffy…
FAITH: Chug! Chug!
WILLOW: Wow, I didn't think she'd be here…
FAITH: Back off. You're nothing but a disappointment.
WILLOW: Hey, Buff!
FAITH: Willow. And…
WILLOW: Buffy, this is Tara.
TARA: Hi.
FAITH: So we've never met. (Tara shakes her head) Okay. Cool. I'm having a thing with names.
WILLOW: Tara was in my wicca group.
FAITH: Uh huh?
WILLOW: So what's going on? Patrol no go?
FAITH: I got tired. The whole Faith thing…  I wanted to let off some steam.
WILLOW: Good for you. You can't work yourself too hard.
FAITH: That's my philosophy.
WILLOW: Anybody wanna soda?
TARA: Water?
FAITH: You guys have been hanging out a lot, huh?
TARA: Yeah. She's really cool.
FAITH: So Willow not driving stick anymore. Who woulda thought? Guess you never know a person till you've been inside their skin.
TARA: She, uh, said he www…
FAITH: He www? You gonna get that sentence out sometime tonight?
WILLOW: Buff. Guy in the corner.
FAITH: Oh yeah. Good call.
TARA: What?
WILLOW: Vampire.
FAITH: He's wicked obvious.
WILLOW: You want help?
FAITH: I got it.
FAITH: Picking on poor defenseless women, well that really gets my dander up.
DATE: (near tears) He attacked me… he was so strong…
FAITH: Well he's gone now. Put some… medicine on that.
DATE: Thank you. Thank you.
FAITH: Yeah, it's cool.
WILLOW: Everything poofed?
FAITH: All's well in the world.
WILLOW: Tara's not feeling great, I'm gonna walk her home.
FAITH: (amused, mock  sincerity) Yeah. You give her whatever she needs.
WILLOW: Are you gonna be in later, or are you going over to Riley's?
SMITH: This'll bloody keep you quiet --
BUFFY: How about this? I'll be quiet, and you can scream.
COLLINS: We go on a job we always put our affairs in order first. In case of accident.
SMITH: Collins…
COLLINS: Sorry, Smithy.
WEATHERBY: Getting her across the border is gonna be a lot more trouble than it's worth.
COLLINS: I'll call the Council. I think it's time for a contingency plan.
FAITH: Hi baby.
WILLOW: I'm sorry you're feeling blechy. But we'll get together with Buffy another time, some time soon. I really think you'll like her --
TARA: She's not your friend.
WILLOW: I may have overestimated the "you liking her" factor. But I wish you'd give her a chance; she's very important to me.
TARA: No, I mean… I don't think she's… her.
WILLOW: You lost me.
TARA: A person's energy has a flow, a unity. Buffy's was fragmented; it grated, like something forced in  where it doesn't belong. Plus she was kinda mean.
WILLOW: You think Buffy's not herself? Like she's possessed or something?
TARA: I'm not sure…
WILLOW: You didn't sense a hyena energy at all did you? Hyena possession is just unpleasant.
TARA: Do you have anything of hers?
WILLOW: Of Buffy's? Uh, uh, Ooh! Ah! (fingering them) Earrings!
TARA: There's a way we can… (flips through book) … The passage to the nether-realm, there's a ritual, if you find her there you should be able to see…
WILLOW: If it'll help Buffy…
TARA: The nether-realm exists beyond the physical world. Accessing it is, it's kind of like astral projection, it's very intense. I'd have to be your anchor, keep you on this plane.
WILLOW: I trust you.
TARA: It's not like anything we've ever --
WILLOW: I trust you.
FAITH: You miss me?
RILEY: I did, actually. Everything's okay?
FAITH: Everything's great.
RILEY: What about Faith?
FAITH: Faith has won a fabulous trip to England, and I got the consolation prize. Which is you.
RILEY: So I don't have to worry about Faith showing up? I have to admit, I was kind of curious to meet her. (aroused) Or I was until about thirty seconds ago…
FAITH: Oh, you wouldn't have liked Faith. She's not proper and joyless like a girl should be. She has a tendency to give in to her animal instincts.
RILEY: Uh, the door's open.
FAITH: So?
RILEY: So, my fantasies don't tend to include a bunch of Marines looking in on me.
FAITH: They might learn something.
RILEY: I'm not that bad. I guess those drugs the professor was feeding me really did make me stronger. I'm healing pretty quick.
FAITH: Well why don't we give you a test drive.
RILEY: Wouldn't say no.
FAITH: How do you want me?
RILEY: How do I --
FAITH: What do you want to do with this body? What nasty little desire have you been itching to try out? Am I a bad girl? Do you wanna hurt me?
RILEY: What are we playing at here?
FAITH: I'm Buffy.
RILEY: Okay, then I'll be Riley.
FAITH: Hey, if you don't wanna play --
RILEY: Right. I don't wanna play.
TARA: The Inward Eye, The Sightless Sea, Ayala flows through the River in Me…
RILEY: (softly) I love you.
FAITH: No… No… Get --
RILEY: Buffy… what? What's wrong?
FAITH: Who are you? What do you want from her?
RILEY: Should I not have…
FAITH: This is meaningless.
RILEY: You're shaking.
FAITH: Nothing.
ADAM: I have been blessed. I have a gift that no man has, no demon has ever had. I know why I'm here. I was created to kill. To extinguish life wherever I find it and I have accepted that responsibility. You have lived in fear and desperation because you didn't have that gift. But it's time to face your fear.
BOONE: Tell us what to do…
ADAM: You are here to be my first. To let them know I'm coming. I am the end of all life, of all magic. I'm the war between man and demon, the war that no one can win. You're a part of that now. You have to show me that you're ready.
BOONE: We are. We're ready.
ADAM: Then ask yourself: What is it? More than man, more than anything else… what is the thing that you fear?
FORREST: Hope you left him alive…
FAITH: What?
FORREST: Boy's supposed to be on the mend.  I don't see you letting him get much rest.
FAITH: I think maybe you should stay out of other people's lives.
FORREST: We've got a mission here. And back when Riley could still think for himself --
FAITH: You've got a mission? I've been fighting demons since before you could shave.
FORREST: Yeah, you're a killer.
FAITH: I'm not a killer! I'm a slayer. You don't know the first thing about me.
FORREST: You really care what I think?
FAITH: No, I… I don't care. God. I don't care…
SMITH: The council.
COLLINS: (into phone) It's Collins.
WEATHERBY: Torch the place?
COLLINS: Get the gas.
SMITH: She could've killed me, she didn't.
COLLINS: Lucky you.
SMITH: Weatherby…
BUFFY: Keys, keys…
WEATHERBY: Stop her, you ponce!
BUFFY: Okay, I'm good at this… (finds) drive!
BUFFY: Giles!
GILES: God --
BUFFY: Don't move!
GILES: Really.
BUFFY: Really.
GILES: Because the resemblance is striking.
BUFFY: I know. Giles, you just have to -- stop inching! You were inching.
GILES: No I wasn't.
BUFFY: Just hear me out.
GILES: I know what you're going to say and --
BUFFY: I'm Buffy.
GILES: All right I didn't know what you were going to say but that doesn't make you less scary.
BUFFY: Faith switched. She had some device, she switched our bodies.
GILES: (slowly) If you're Buffy, then, then you'll allow me to tie you up -- without killing me -- until we can be sure that you're telling the truth.
BUFFY: Giles, Faith has taken my body and for all I know she's taken it to Mexico by now. I don't have time for bondage fun. (idea) Ask me a question. Ask me anything!
GILES: (thinks, then:) Who is president!?!
BUFFY: We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion.
GILES: Yes. Right. Um…
BUFFY: (impatient) Oh, this is -- Giles, you turned into a DEMON and I knew it was you.  Can't you just look in my eyes and  be all intuitive?
GILES: (probing) How did I turn into a demon?
BUFFY: 'Cause of Ethan Rayne. And, and, you have a girlfriend named Olivia and you haven't had a job since we blew up the school -- which, uh, is valid, lifestylewise, I mean you're not like a slacker, but, okay -- and (coup de grace) When I had psychic power I heard my Mom think you were like a stevedore during sex. Do you want me to keep going?
GILES: Actually, I beg you to stop.
BUFFY: What's a stevedore?
GILES: All right. Let's… I want you to explain everything.
BUFFY: And I will. AFTER we get Faith. Jesus, Giles, she's got my skin on.
GILES: Yes of course. Just give me a minute to --
WILLOW: Giles!
BUFFY: Willow!
WILLOW: Oh my god.
BUFFY: Willow, wait. You don't understand.
WILLOW: You're Buffy. You and Faith switched bodies, probably through a Draconian Katra spell.
GILES: She understands it better than I do…
BUFFY: How did you…
WILLOW: Tara. Tara this is Buffy, only really this time.
TARA: Hi.
WILLOW: Tara's a really powerful witch --
TARA: Not really --
WILLOW: No really, and she knew right away that you weren't you so we connected with the nether realm and found out what had happened and then we conjured this.
BUFFY: Does that --
WILLOW: (nodding) It's a Katra -- or, the home-conjured version. It should switch you back, if you can get hold of Faith.
BUFFY: Oh thank God. I was afraid I… you guys rule.
GILES: Yes. Of course I would have… had I known, I…
BUFFY: (to Willow) Do you know where Faith is?
GILES: …Yes, Buffy's here with me. In fact, she -- Oh. Right.
REPORTER: … and barricaded themselves in the church with at least twenty parishioners. One of the few who escaped described the three men as frighteningly disfigured, almost inhuman.
REPORTER: So far one escapee has since died of severe neck wounds. (more) There is no report of the condition of the parishioners still trapped inside, but their assailants have vowed to kill all of them if police attempt to storm the church.
BOONE: It's hard to believe. I've been avoiding this place for so many years, and it's nothing. It's <u>nice</u>, got the pretty windows, the pillars, lots of folks to eat… where's the thing I was so afraid of? You know, the <u>lord</u>? He's supposed to be here -- <u>he gave us this address</u>. Well, we'll just have to start killing off his people, and see if he shows up.
RILEY: (knows the answer) What'd he say.
SERGEANT: (defeated) He said I was to defer command to you.
RILEY: Then hold your men until the reserves arrive. This is a military situation.
SERGEANT: What, do they got bombs in there?
RILEY: Your men are not prepared to deal with them. Just trust me.
FAITH: How many are in there?
RILEY: We think there's three.
FAITH: I can do three.
RILEY: Not alone… Wait till the troops get here. They're still mobilizing.
FAITH: How'd <u>you</u> respond so fast?
RILEY: I didn't. I was just late for church.
FAITH: The troops get here, you send 'em in, But I'm going.
RILEY: I don't want you risking --
FAITH: Don't tell me what to do! I'm Buffy, I… This is what I have to do.
RILEY: Then I'm coming with.
FAITH: I can't use you.
BOONE: I told the cops they send anyone in, I start the whole massacre thing…
FAITH: Well, I'm not the cops. I just come to pray.
BOONE: (moving toward her) Now's a good time to start.
FAITH: You're not gonna kill these people.
BOONE: Why not?
FAITH: Because it's wrong.
BOONE: You're the slayer.
FAITH: The one and only.
SERGEANT: You people get out of here.
WILLOW: But we have to get inside --
SERGEANT: The police are handling this. Just back off right now.
GILES: Dammit man, we have to get inside! Our… families are in there! Our mothers and tiny babies, for the love of God man, we have to do something! What if it was <u>your</u> tiny baby, could you stand by and wait? No!
FAITH: Simple deal. You let everyone go, I let you walk. If I were you, I'd think about it. This offer is not available in stores.
BOONE: You think we're afraid of you? We're not afraid of anything anymore.
FAITH: Then let these people go, and you can all three take me on.
BOONE: I got a better idea.
BUFFY: Riley!
RILEY: It's all right, miss. You just get out of harm's way.
BUFFY: Riley, it's me, it's -- never mind. How many are in there?
RILEY: Well… who are you?
BOONE: I have strength you couldn't dream of! Adam has shown me the way and there is <u>nothing</u> that can -- gnnnnh --
BUFFY: You can't win this --
FAITH: Shut up! You think I'm afraid of you? You're nothing!
BUFFY: She's gone. Not a trace. Giles says the Council guys have cleared out, too.
RILEY: I don't understand. How could she have… how is it <u>possible</u>?
BUFFY: Magic.
RILEY: I knew there was something… I should have picked up on it, I  should have just --
BUFFY: You slept with her.
RILEY: I slept with <u>you</u>.
BUFFY: I don't think she's coming back.
RILEY: I guess she had her fun.
BUFFY: (looking out the window) Yeah… Fun…
