Let go! Let me go!
I have to get home! She's with my mother! NO!
You don't understand…
She took away my… my body…
Faith…
Who are you?
Listen to me. You've made a mistake.
I'm not threatening you. Listen. I am not Faith.
I'm Buffy Summers. Faith performed some kind of spell to switch our bodies.
You have to find Faith. Call Giles! Get him here.
How about this? I'll be quiet, and you can scream.
Keys, keys…
Okay, I'm good at this… (finds) drive!
Giles!
Don't move!
Really.
I know. Giles, you just have to -- stop inching! You were inching.
Just hear me out.
I'm Buffy.
Faith switched. She had some device, she switched our bodies.
Giles, Faith has taken my body and for all I know she's taken it to Mexico by now. I don't have time for bondage fun. (idea) Ask me a question. Ask me anything!
We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion.
(impatient) Oh, this is -- Giles, you turned into a DEMON and I knew it was you.  Can't you just look in my eyes and  be all intuitive?
'Cause of Ethan Rayne. And, and, you have a girlfriend named Olivia and you haven't had a job since we blew up the school -- which, uh, is valid, lifestylewise, I mean you're not like a slacker, but, okay -- and (coup de grace) When I had psychic power I heard my Mom think you were like a stevedore during sex. Do you want me to keep going?
What's a stevedore?
And I will. AFTER we get Faith. Jesus, Giles, she's got my skin on.
Willow!
Willow, wait. You don't understand.
How did you…
Does that --
Oh thank God. I was afraid I… you guys rule.
(to Willow) Do you know where Faith is?
Riley!
Riley, it's me, it's -- never mind. How many are in there?
You can't win this --
She's gone. Not a trace. Giles says the Council guys have cleared out, too.
Magic.
You slept with her.
I don't think she's coming back.
(looking out the window) Yeah… Fun…
