Look at him. Have you ever seen  anything so masculine?

(very hurt) Sure. It's okay.
Some vengeance is justified, you know...
Some vengeance is justified, you know...
How much butter goes in with these?
I'll go.
I liked his wife. She gave me pie.
(re: Angel) This is Angel. He's large and glowery, isn't he?
He's fine. Lots of ears.
(to Willow, intrigued) What's he like when he <u>is</u> evil?
That's nice...
