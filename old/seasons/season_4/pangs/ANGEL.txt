She sounds good. Kind of intense about this Thanksgiving thing...
Whatever killed the woman in the museum, that's probably the danger.
Maybe I'm wrong... but, I have to try something. I can't just keep watching.
It's not yours anymore either. Are you going to walk away?
If she knew I was here, I-- It would distract her. It could get her hurt. I don't want to, to get in the way.
Or maybe it was trapped there and now it's released...
Do you know Father Gabriel? He knows the history of this place pretty well -- family dates back to mission times. He might fill in some blanks.
To watch her.
Believe me, I'm not getting the good half of the deal. To be outside, looking in at what I can't... I'd forgotten how bad it feels.
I'm not evil. I'm here to help Buffy.
My friend had a vision. Buffy's  in danger.
If she sees me it'll be worse.
Willow?
You know how I feel about her. If there was any way...
It's just, everything's different now.
Will. I'm here to protect Buffy. I don't have a whole lotta time for personal stuff.
Well, if you can just tell me... (totally jealous) Who's that guy?
Willow--
I'm not evil again! Why does everyone think that?
I haven't been evil for a long time.
Yeah. All the Chumash weapons are missing from the cultural center. Something's up. Where's Buffy?
Why the Dean?
He's a warrior. To a warrior the leader means the strongest fighter.
He's formed a raiding party.
I'll call her. You get back <u>fast</u>.
Help the others!
