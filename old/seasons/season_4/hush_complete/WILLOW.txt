Boy, that was an exciting class, huh?
And that last twenty minutes -- it was a revelation. Just laid out everything we needed to know for the final. I'd hate to have missed that.
(smiles) You were very discreet. Minimal drool.
So, were you dreaming?
You know, you guys go, I'm gonna do the thing. (to Buffy) I'll see you after the Wicca group.
Well, this is good, this is all fun... a bake sale, some baked goods there... But there's also other stuff... that we might show interest in... as a wicca group...
Well, there's the wacky notion of spells...
I was actually talking more about real spells. You know: conjuring, transmutation...
No, no, my energy's always very... you really don't do any spells?
Talk! All talk: blah blah Gaia blah blah moon, menstrual lifeforce power... I thought after a few sessions we'd get into something real, but...
Buncha wannablessedbe's. It's just a fad. Nowadays every girl with a henna tattoo and a spice rack think she's a sister to the dark ones.
Well, I'd like to float something bigger than a pencil someday... Hey how's with you and Riley? You guys seemed pretty snugly after class...
Do I have to tie you two together?
Get with it! I need my vicarious lovin'!
It didn't bother you with Parker.
(mouths) Hey.
(mouths) I'm deaf! I've gone deaf!
You were there looking for me?
What they were talking about?
Yeah. So how long have you been practicing?
Oh, I'm not -- I don't have much in the way of power, really, I mean most of my potions come out... soup. Also spells going awry, friends in danger -- I'm definitely nothing special.
Well, I thought we made a pretty good team -- not getting killed at all.... with some soda machine, boom! Pretty cool. Seems like you're kinda powerful.
I know exactly what you mean.
