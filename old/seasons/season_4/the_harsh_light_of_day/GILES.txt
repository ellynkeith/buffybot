Well, shelve them correctly and we  can finish.
My system? It's the alphabet.
Believe me, I am kicking myself.
(get on with it) I'm disillusioned. I shall never love again.
The Gem of Amarra? Are you sure?
It's just, it's not real. It's like, like a  vampire version of the Holy Grail.  A source of some kind of enormous  power, always conveniently vague...
I don't see how something that valuable,  if it were real, could remain hidden on a  Hellmouth, with all its demonic activity.  I could probably even track the development  of the myth...
Very subtle, but I was going to do it  myself anyway. You've done all you  can for tonight. Go to bed.
The alphabet. It's fairly well known.
(no kidding) Oh? Really?
I'm sincerely relieved to hear it. Now,  may we talk about the impending disaster?
A text. It refers to the Gem of Amarra  residing in the "valley of the sun."
It seems Spike may know what he's about.  The gem may exist after all, in Sunnydale,  in a sealed underground crypt.

I'm not-- It's not--

Spike. Come on. Xander, find Buffy  and meet us there.
Harmony? Where's Spike?
Where did he go?
So the question now is, what do we do  with it? It's obviously extremely  dangerous and destroying it--
But, Buffy, any vampire who gets this  is essentially unkillable... Oh...
Buffy, are you sure?
