And it's definitely the crypt, right?  I'm not keen on tunneling into  someone's septic tank.
Better be more than sure, mate, cuz  I'd hate to have to hurt you. No.  Wait. Hate's too strong a world.
Harm? does this look like a good time  to talk?
Nobody knows I'm here. Now I'm  not killing the Slayer's best friend,  as that would tend to announce my  presence. And we're too bloody close...
Sod off, eat something. I've got work to do.
He's perfectly fresh.
Harm...
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Tonight. I'll take you somewhere nice.
Well, this is interesting. Sort of a  double date.
But the fun's just starting: old friends,  lots to drink...
Say, let's have a look at the new boy.  Hmm. I like him. He's got, what's the  word, vulnerability.
Actually, how we met, funny story, really--
Maybe <u>I</u> dumped <u>her</u> --
Harm. We're going. (ominously, to Buffy) It isn't time yet.
No.
No. Wait, on second thought, yeah,  go do that. Take your time, do Melanie  and the kids as well.
Harm, I've been wondering, just for  my own curiosity, what's it take to  get you to <u>shut the hell up</u>?
We've got an extra set of chains.
Drusilla.
Say her name.
Bite your tongue.
Harm? What are you doing?
Why?
I've got to get back to work.
(under his breath) I love syphilis more than you.
(shouted) It's here! The crypt is here. I can't  bloody believe it.
We're close now. No one leaves the  lair 'til we're in. I don't want the Slayer  tracking anyone to the tunnel. And  that means you, Harm. You're an  indoor kitty now.
Listen to me, you stupid bint. This gem  is everything. I came back to Sunnydale  for it. A place which has witnessed some  truly spectacular kickings of my arse.  The very sound of the name burns  along my nerve endings. Do you get it?  I hate Sunnydale more than life itself.  Now, when I have the Gem, they all  die, don't worry, but until then, <u>stay</u>
 <u>inside</u>. And, by the way, I would be  insanely happy if, from this point on,  I heard bugger all about sodding <u>France</u>!
(bitterly) Love hurts, baby.
(awed) It's real.
Nick whatever you want. I don't care.
Hang on.
That's my gem...
Good idea. I think I'll go play outside.
Innit a fantastic day? Birds singing,  squirrels making lots of rotten little  squirrels, sun beaming down in a nice,  non-fatal way. It's very exciting, I can't  wait to find out if I freckle.
Oh yeah. The Gem of Amarra.
Getting tired Slayer?
A little. Awfully bright, disorienting...  oh, no, I lied. I'm fine.
Did he play the sensitive lad and get  <u>you</u> to seduce <u>him</u>? Good trick if the  girl's thick enough to buy it.
