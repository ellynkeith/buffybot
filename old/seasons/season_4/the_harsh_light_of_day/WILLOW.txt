You know what else I love about college?  How when the professor comes in, the  class gets all quiet.
Hey look, Parker's here.
You're not looking? He's really  cute in green.
That's nice. You know, when you spend  <u>all week</u> with a boy, you are allowed  to look at him directly.
Almost. Buffy's looking at Parker.  Who, it turns out, has a reflection,  so, big plus there.
Buffy's having lusty wrong feelings.
Wait. No you're not.
No, they're not wrong feelings.  'Cause there's no wrong. You're  free. You're both grown-ups...  You <u>are</u> free, right?
Um... Devon? Aren't they supposed  to dance?
Harmony! I haven't seen you since...
Yeah. So how was your summer?
Ooh. And museums.
I heard they have 'em. Little rumors  you pick up on the street.
No, you either.
Back off, Harmony.
She's back from her summer vacation  and she's different.
Paler.
Band-aid now.
I felt she was adjusting. You know,  when the fang went in.
She just made me so mad. "My boyfriend's  gonna beat you up!"
Well, if you believe her. I mean, she  always lied about stuff like that.  "Oh, he goes to another school,  you wouldn't know him."
Giles found something.
Demon fancy-talk for Sunnydale.
(to Giles) I'll call Xander and Oz, meet you at  your place.
And? Details? I mean, not <u>details</u>, don't  need a diagram, but maybe, like, a  blurry water-color?
I love this part. Don't you love this part?  Where it's all new and everything's a  discovery?
Maybe it doesn't work. It's like, art.
(gently) Harmony...?
I like it.
(aside to Xander) She's giving it to Angel. Don't make  a fuss.
Well, from what I understand, pretty  much. But it won't always be like that.  You've just had some really bad luck.
Well, why shouldn't you, if it's what  you want? I mean, as long as it's safe.  Oh, Buffy, it was safe, wasn't it?
Well, maybe you made a mistake, but  that's okay. Next time-- (off Buffy's look) What?
No it wasn't. He said that so you'd take  a chance and sleep with him. He's a  poop-head.
I'm your friend. I'd call you repulsive in a second.
You're missing something about the  whole "poop-head" principle.
You sure?
