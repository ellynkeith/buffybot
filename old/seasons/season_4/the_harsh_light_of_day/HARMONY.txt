Since graduation. Big snake, huh?
I was going to go to France. But I  didn't. I was dying to see the stores.
Museums?
You're always so funny, Willow.  You haven't changed a bit.
Oh, maybe a little.
Okay, fine. Hide behind your <u>boyfriend</u>.  Well, guess what? I've got a boyfriend  too, and he's gonna be mad you were  mean to me.
Hi Baby. I'm back.
How's my little blondy-bear?
Are you gonna kill Willow today?  'Cause I want you to say "this is for  messing with my sweet girl," then  you know...
You almost killed her last year,  suddenly it's a big deal...
This one tastes funny. Take me out to eat!
I think I was in a math class with him  last year and I didn't like him much  then either.
I wanna go to a party!
(sexy) Maybe I would... after a party.
Buffy. Hi. What a cute outfit, last year.
Hey!
She left him for a Fungus Demon.  It's all he talks about some days...
(to Buffy) Yeah, but as soon as we have the Gem  of Amarra you're gonna be sooo sorry -  Ow!
(off paper) Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?
Oh. Can I make him a vampire?
Hey, I don't have a pulse. Cool. Can we  eat a doctor and get a stethoscope so I  can hear my heart not beating?
And if my heart's not beating, what are  all these veins for? I'm simply covered  in these blue veins. See?
Eww. Just because Dorcas went in  for that kind of stuff...
Whatever.
Dorcas.
<u>Do it <b>for</b> me</u>.
I'm writing "Spike loves Harmony"  on your back.
It's fun. I'm bored. You can write on me.
You love that tunnel more than me.
But, Spike, you said you'd take me places!  You said we'd go to France and now  I can't even leave the lair?
I don't know why I let you be so mean  to me.
Ew. Like you're too good to work a clasp.
What are you doing, you big freak?
Fine! If that's all that matters to you,  then take it. <u>Take it and get out</u>!
(gasping through tears) Being a vampire sucks.
He staked me and he took it. Tried to  take it right off my finger. Like I wouldn't  have just give it to him? I'd've given  him anything he wanted. He was my  platinum baby and I loved him.
