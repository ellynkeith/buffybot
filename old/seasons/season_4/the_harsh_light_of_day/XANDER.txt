I'm not enjoying this.
I don't get your crazy system.
Huh. Would you look at that.
Anya? Hey, last time I saw you, fleeing  in terror. How'd that work out for you?
Yeah. Needed some money and--
Our what? Our who?
I-- I-- we have a relationship?
Yes. On our one and only date. Second  date called on account of snake, remember?  And, there's the whole you-used-to-be-a- man-killing-demon thing, which, to be  fair, is as much my issue as it is yours...
Really? You know, if I'm in the check-out  line at Wal-Mart I've had that same one.
Anya, slow down. In fact, come to a  screeching halt. This is just, I'd say it's  out of nowhere, but that doesn't really  capture the amount of nowhere which  it's out of. See, these things kind of  have to develop on their own.
I don't know. It just... happens.
Come in!
Yeah, I s'pose. So... you're my first guest  at Casa del Xander -- not the final name,  still working on it. You want something?  I've got Cranapple.
You know, it's customary to call before  you show up, not that --
So-- So-- So-- the crux of this plan is...
Uh-huh. Just working through a little  hysterical deafness here.
Ah, right. But, see, we hardly know each  other. I mean, I like you. More than  other ex-demons. And you have a certain...  directness that I admire...
I do. I show my teeth and make repeated  'ha' noises. But sexual inter- what you're  talking about, well -- and I am actually  turning into a woman as I say this -  but it's about expressing something,  and accepting consequences...
And the amazing thing? Still more  romantic than Faith.
Um... okay.
Yeah?
Whoa. Giles has a TV. Everybody look  at this, Giles has a TV! He's shallow  like us!
Buffy!
Have you seen Buffy.
(didn't hear a word) Anya-- I don't have time.
Quite tasteful. Really worth getting  my ribs bashed in.
What's going on? What's in L.A.?
