WILLOW: You know what else I love about college?  How when the professor comes in, the  class gets all quiet.
BUFFY: Oh I hate that. I'm always like, what?  Did something scary come in?  Do I have to kill it?
WILLOW: Hey look, Parker's here.
BUFFY: (disinterested) Yeah?
WILLOW: You're not looking? He's really  cute in green.
BUFFY: Blue.  (caught) He's, uh, reflected in that mirror.
WILLOW: That's nice. You know, when you spend  <u>all week</u> with a boy, you are allowed  to look at him directly.
BUFFY: Not all week. We've hung out.  Moderately incessantly. But we're  not here together, and I don't want  to crowd him.
OZ: You guys ready to load up and go?
WILLOW: Almost. Buffy's looking at Parker.  Who, it turns out, has a reflection,  so, big plus there.
OZ: Good looking guy. Works out.  (off their looks) I have eyes.
WILLOW: Buffy's having lusty wrong feelings.
BUFFY: No I'm not.
WILLOW: Wait. No you're not.
BUFFY: I'm not? Oh, I so am.
WILLOW: No, they're not wrong feelings.  'Cause there's no wrong. You're  free. You're both grown-ups...  You <u>are</u> free, right?
BUFFY: Well, sure. (realizing) Yeah. I really feel like I am, like I'm  over... everything else. High school stuff.
PARKER: I just wanted to say, I'm heading out.  And it's not real safe around here, so,  if you need a walk back to your dorm...
BUFFY: Guess I was kinda silly, not planning ahead...
PARKER: Don't worry about it. So... you  ready to go?
BUFFY: Absolutely.
DEVON: That was, like, the best set ever.  We'll do great in L.A. We'll have  'em glued to their seats.
WILLOW: Um... Devon? Aren't they supposed  to dance?
OZ: We could glue them to the dance floor.
DEVON: (to Oz, as they exit) I didn't mean with real glue.  You got that, right?
WILLOW: Harmony! I haven't seen you since...
HARMONY: Since graduation. Big snake, huh?
WILLOW: Yeah. So how was your summer?
HARMONY: I was going to go to France. But I  didn't. I was dying to see the stores.
WILLOW: Ooh. And museums.
HARMONY: Museums?
WILLOW: I heard they have 'em. Little rumors  you pick up on the street.
HARMONY: You're always so funny, Willow.  You haven't changed a bit.
WILLOW: No, you either.
HARMONY: Oh, maybe a little.
WILLOW: Back off, Harmony.
HARMONY: Okay, fine. Hide behind your <u>boyfriend</u>.  Well, guess what? I've got a boyfriend  too, and he's gonna be mad you were  mean to me.
DEVON: Man, that looked like Harmony. Weird.  I saw her get bit at graduation. (off their looks) I didn't tell you?
BUFFY: Hobbies?
PARKER: Yeah, hobbies. Interests. I feel like there's  so much I still don't know about you.  What do you like to do?
BUFFY: Well, mostly I... you know, hang out  and do stuff.
PARKER: Yeah, I was into that for a while.
BUFFY: What's what?
PARKER: You have a scar.
BUFFY: Oh. Right. Angry puppy.
PARKER: Oh, mine are all psychological.
BUFFY: Please, they're the best kind.
PARKER: Well, my father died last year.
BUFFY: Oh, Parker. God, I'm sorry, I didn't  mean to bring up something like that.  Bad, bad Buffy.
PARKER: No, no, I'm okay to talk about it now.  And I'm not doing the deep "get sympathy"  routine. Don't you hate guys that are all  "I'm dark and brooding so give me love"?  BUFFY I... I've never met that type.
PARKER: I just wanted to say that the thing that  made it so sad was that there was a lot  of stuff he didn't get to finish. Like,  he thought there'd always be this future  out there, and then there wasn't.  It's made me think about, you know,  living for now.
BUFFY: I think about that sometimes. A lot,  actually. How fast it could end?  See, I sort of, drowned once, a couple  of years ago. And I came back. Obviously.
PARKER: Wow. I mean, you hear about stuff  like that...
BUFFY: Yeah, well, pool safety, important.  Anyway, I don't put things off anymore.  Like you were saying.
PARKER: That's great. Everyone says they get it:  "oh, man, me too, live for today," but  what they really want is an excuse to  goof off and not study for finals.
BUFFY: Also a valid life choice.
PARKER: It's cool to find someone else who  understands.
BUFFY: So, when you go to bed tonight, what  are you going to regret not doing today?
PARKER: I'm going to regret being too nervous to  ask you to the party at Wolf House  tomorrow night. Do you want to go  to the party at Wolf --
BUFFY: Yes.
PARKER: Buffy? When you... drowned, whoever  brought you back? they're getting a big  kiss from me.
BUFFY: Xander will be so happy.
XANDER: I'm not enjoying this.
GILES: Well, shelve them correctly and we  can finish.
XANDER: I don't get your crazy system.
GILES: My system? It's the alphabet.
XANDER: Huh. Would you look at that.
ANYA: You should lock your door.
GILES: Believe me, I am kicking myself.
XANDER: Anya? Hey, last time I saw you, fleeing  in terror. How'd that work out for you?
ANYA: (to Giles) I need to talk to Xander. Go away.
ANYA: Your mother said you were working here.
XANDER: Yeah. Needed some money and--
ANYA: Where is our relationship going?
XANDER: Our what? Our who?
ANYA: Relationship. What kind do we have  and what is it progressing toward?
XANDER: I-- I-- we have a relationship?
ANYA: We went to the prom.
XANDER: Yes. On our one and only date. Second  date called on account of snake, remember?  And, there's the whole you-used-to-be-a- man-killing-demon thing, which, to be  fair, is as much my issue as it is yours...
ANYA: I can't stop thinking about you. In my  dreams sometimes you're all naked.
XANDER: Really? You know, if I'm in the check-out  line at Wal-Mart I've had that same one.
ANYA: So can I assume a standing Friday night  date and mutual recognition of prom night  as our dating anniversary?
XANDER: Anya, slow down. In fact, come to a  screeching halt. This is just, I'd say it's  out of nowhere, but that doesn't really  capture the amount of nowhere which  it's out of. See, these things kind of  have to develop on their own.
ANYA: All right. How?
XANDER: I don't know. It just... happens.
BUFFY: This is it. My door. It's wood. Maybe  some kind of wood veneer.
PARKER: Nice.
OZ: Hey. Remember Harmony?
WILLOW: She's back from her summer vacation  and she's different.
BUFFY: (frustrated) Different?
WILLOW: Paler.
PARKER: Is your neck okay?
BUFFY: Neck! Paler. Puppy! The angry puppy!
OZ: (what a lame cover) Yeah. We came to warn you. About  the puppy.
BUFFY: (to Parker) I should take care of this.
PARKER: I'll pick you up tomorrow for the party...
BUFFY: (really meaning it) I can't wait.
WILLOW: Band-aid now.
BUFFY: Harmony's a vampire? She must be  dying without a reflection.
WILLOW: I felt she was adjusting. You know,  when the fang went in.
BUFFY: Oh, Willow, I'm sorry. It's not funny.  That must have been terrible.
WILLOW: She just made me so mad. "My boyfriend's  gonna beat you up!"
BUFFY: Boyfriend?
WILLOW: Well, if you believe her. I mean, she  always lied about stuff like that.  "Oh, he goes to another school,  you wouldn't know him."
OZ: Devon dated her for a while, but she  was too flaky for him. Which, stop  and marvel at the concept.
BUFFY: Guy dating Harmony -- dead? Must be  like the most tolerant guy in the world.
HARMONY: Hi Baby. I'm back.
SPIKE: And it's definitely the crypt, right?  I'm not keen on tunneling into  someone's septic tank.
BRIAN: It's the crypt. The radar soundings are  clear. The walls are thinnest here, at the  bottom. You have to tunnel from  underneath. More work, but I'm sure --
SPIKE: Better be more than sure, mate, cuz  I'd hate to have to hurt you. No.  Wait. Hate's too strong a world.
BRIAN: (terrified) I... swear... I...
HARMONY: How's my little blondy-bear?
SPIKE: Harm? does this look like a good time  to talk?
HARMONY: Are you gonna kill Willow today?  'Cause I want you to say "this is for  messing with my sweet girl," then  you know...
SPIKE: Nobody knows I'm here. Now I'm  not killing the Slayer's best friend,  as that would tend to announce my  presence. And we're too bloody close...
HARMONY: You almost killed her last year,  suddenly it's a big deal...
SPIKE: Sod off, eat something. I've got work to do.
HARMONY: This one tastes funny. Take me out to eat!
SPIKE: He's perfectly fresh.
HARMONY: I think I was in a math class with him  last year and I didn't like him much  then either.
SPIKE: Harm...
HARMONY: I wanna go to a party!
SPIKE: You'd like that, wouldn't you?
HARMONY: (sexy) Maybe I would... after a party.
SPIKE: Tonight. I'll take you somewhere nice.
PARKER: Watch out. You can take pictures, but  stay in the safari truck at all times.
BUFFY: (shouted back) Better. No old Romans.
PARKER: (shouted) You wanna dance?
BUFFY: (shouted) Let's have a meaningful talk instead.
HARMONY: Buffy. Hi. What a cute outfit, last year.
SPIKE: Well, this is interesting. Sort of a  double date.
BUFFY: I think you two should go.
SPIKE: But the fun's just starting: old friends,  lots to drink...
PARKER: Looks like your friend there started the  party a little early, huh?
SPIKE: Say, let's have a look at the new boy.  Hmm. I like him. He's got, what's the  word, vulnerability.
PARKER: Hi, I'm Parker...
BUFFY: And you, with Harmony. Lose a bet?
HARMONY: Hey!
SPIKE: Actually, how we met, funny story, really--
BUFFY: (to Parker) I'll be right back!
BUFFY: Dru dump you again?
SPIKE: Maybe <u>I</u> dumped <u>her</u> --
HARMONY: She left him for a Fungus Demon.  It's all he talks about some days...
SPIKE: Harm. We're going. (ominously, to Buffy) It isn't time yet.
HARMONY: (to Buffy) Yeah, but as soon as we have the Gem  of Amarra you're gonna be sooo sorry -  Ow!
XANDER: Come in!
ANYA: Your mother sent me around from the  front of the house. She also said to ask  you to add fabric softener when the timer  goes off. Can we talk some more?
XANDER: Yeah, I s'pose. So... you're my first guest  at Casa del Xander -- not the final name,  still working on it. You want something?  I've got Cranapple.
ANYA: All right.
XANDER: You know, it's customary to call before  you show up, not that --
BUFFY: Yeah, Spike. With Harmony, if you  can believe it. I mean, I thought Spike  and Dru were a forever kind of deal,  didn't you? Where's the commitment?
GILES: (get on with it) I'm disillusioned. I shall never love again.
BUFFY: So anyway, I couldn't figure out why  he ran away, but Harmony said something.  What they're here for. The Gem of  something... Amarra. He's waiting 'til  he gets it--
GILES: The Gem of Amarra? Are you sure?
BUFFY: Yeah. What's up?
GILES: It's just, it's not real. It's like, like a  vampire version of the Holy Grail.  A source of some kind of enormous  power, always conveniently vague...
BUFFY: Well Spike seems to think it exists.  And he's looking in Sunnydale.
GILES: I don't see how something that valuable,  if it were real, could remain hidden on a  Hellmouth, with all its demonic activity.  I could probably even track the development  of the myth...
BUFFY: And I'm with you. Myth tracking. I mean,  I don't really need a full eight hours, right?  A little shaky, but that's okay...
GILES: Very subtle, but I was going to do it  myself anyway. You've done all you  can for tonight. Go to bed.
BUFFY: Uh-huh. Sleepy. Yawn. Bye.
HARMONY: (off paper) Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?
SPIKE: No.
HARMONY: Oh. Can I make him a vampire?
SPIKE: No. Wait, on second thought, yeah,  go do that. Take your time, do Melanie  and the kids as well.
HARMONY: Hey, I don't have a pulse. Cool. Can we  eat a doctor and get a stethoscope so I  can hear my heart not beating?
SPIKE: Harm, I've been wondering, just for  my own curiosity, what's it take to  get you to <u>shut the hell up</u>?
HARMONY: And if my heart's not beating, what are  all these veins for? I'm simply covered  in these blue veins. See?
SPIKE: We've got an extra set of chains.
HARMONY: Eww. Just because Dorcas went in  for that kind of stuff...
SPIKE: Drusilla.
HARMONY: Whatever.
SPIKE: Say her name.
HARMONY: Dorcas.
SPIKE: Bite your tongue.
HARMONY: <u>Do it <b>for</b> me</u>.
ANYA: ...At which point the matter is brought  to a conclusion with both parties satisfied  and able to move on with their separate  lives and interests. To sum up, I think  it's a workable plan.
XANDER: So-- So-- So-- the crux of this plan is...
ANYA: Sexual intercourse. I've said it like a  dozen times.
XANDER: Uh-huh. Just working through a little  hysterical deafness here.
ANYA: It's the secret to getting you out of my  mind. Putting you behind me. Behind me,  figuratively. I'm thinking face-to-face  for the event itself.
XANDER: Ah, right. But, see, we hardly know each  other. I mean, I like you. More than  other ex-demons. And you have a certain...  directness that I admire...
ANYA: I amuse you. I can tell. Sometimes you laugh.
XANDER: I do. I show my teeth and make repeated  'ha' noises. But sexual inter- what you're  talking about, well -- and I am actually  turning into a woman as I say this -  but it's about expressing something,  and accepting consequences...
ANYA: I have condoms. Some are black.  XANDER That's-- that's very considerate.
ANYA: I like you. You're funny and you're  nicely shaped. And, frankly, it's ludicrous  to have these interlocking bodies and  not interlock.
XANDER: And the amazing thing? Still more  romantic than Faith.
ANYA: Fabric softener.
BUFFY: Parker. I wasn't sure I'd find you.
PARKER: I was getting a little worried.
BUFFY: I am so sorry. I-- the English guy, he's  an old... friend. And the thing is, he's,  he's not supposed to drink. And I saw  him here, you know, land of the beer...
PARKER: Buffy, it's okay. You did a good thing  for your friend. (then) Did, uh, did you and he used to, like,  go out, or...?
BUFFY: No. No, we didn't.
PARKER: Good.
BUFFY: And what do I do? Stand here and watch?
PARKER: Buffy.
PARKER: Well, I declared pre-med but I hated it.  I switched to History.
BUFFY: History. Compelling places. Fascinating dates.
PARKER: People think it's dull. But there's something  amazing about these huge events, that  when you dig down into them, they're  all about people. Regular people, just  trying to make choices.
BUFFY: I never thought of it like that. history  always seemed like just, stuff that happened.
PARKER: That's 'cause when you look back, it  seems like things only could have  happened that one way. Like people  were swept up in events they couldn't  control. But I don't believe that.  You always have a choice. With  everything you do.
BUFFY: It doesn't feel like it. To me, a lot of  the time, it feels like stuff's just coming  at me, you know, and I'm reacting as  fast as I can, just trying to keep going.  Just-- just trying to be on my feet  before the next thing hits.
PARKER: That sounds exhausting.
BUFFY: It really is.
PARKER: I just had to. Is this okay?
BUFFY: Mmm.
PARKER: (teasing now) Because I could stop, if you wanted.  Your choice.
BUFFY: Making a choice.
GILES: The alphabet. It's fairly well known.
BUFFY: Parker?
PARKER: Hey, you're up!
BUFFY: You're here.
PARKER: I live here.
BUFFY: I didn't know where you were.
PARKER: It seemed like you were gonna be out  for a while, so I went for coffee and  doughnuts. Better than whatever I've  got around here, warm soda and  breath mints.
BUFFY: Yeah, but, breath mints, I wouldn't  be turning 'em down.
PARKER: You look cute.
BUFFY: Well, if you think <u>this</u> is attractive,  wait 'till you see me with the stomach flu.
PARKER: Actually, the thing is, my mom's  coming to visit...
BUFFY: Oh, gosh. I didn't know. Look, I'll just  clear out of here. But maybe later, we  could, you know, talk and stuff?
PARKER: I'll call you, if that's okay?
BUFFY: That's great. And, before I go...
PARKER: A kiss?
BUFFY: I was thinking pants. But a kiss is  good too.
ANYA: So... I'm over you now.
XANDER: Um... okay.
ANYA: Okay?!
XANDER: Yeah?
SPIKE: Harm? What are you doing?
HARMONY: I'm writing "Spike loves Harmony"  on your back.
SPIKE: Why?
HARMONY: It's fun. I'm bored. You can write on me.
SPIKE: I've got to get back to work.
HARMONY: You love that tunnel more than me.
SPIKE: (under his breath) I love syphilis more than you.
BUFFY: Giles! Hi! I... I didn't know you were here.
GILES: (no kidding) Oh? Really?
BUFFY: (to Giles) I was. Studying. At the library. All night. (realizing the flaw) All Saturday night. Okay, you know what?  I'm an adult. It's none of your business  where I was.
GILES: I'm sincerely relieved to hear it. Now,  may we talk about the impending disaster?
WILLOW: Giles found something.
GILES: A text. It refers to the Gem of Amarra  residing in the "valley of the sun."
WILLOW: Demon fancy-talk for Sunnydale.
GILES: It seems Spike may know what he's about.  The gem may exist after all, in Sunnydale,  in a sealed underground crypt.
BUFFY: You guys find that crypt. I'll track down  Spike, stop him before he gets there.
GILES: I'll get started.
WILLOW: (to Giles) I'll call Xander and Oz, meet you at  your place.
BUFFY: Yeah, it happened.
WILLOW: And? Details? I mean, not <u>details</u>, don't  need a diagram, but maybe, like, a  blurry water-color?
BUFFY: It was nice. Really nice. He's going  to call.
WILLOW: I love this part. Don't you love this part?  Where it's all new and everything's a  discovery?
BUFFY: I don't know-- (smiling, admitting it) Yeah, I guess I do.
SPIKE: (shouted) It's here! The crypt is here. I can't  bloody believe it.
BRIAN: (relieved) I knew it was here.
SPIKE: We're close now. No one leaves the  lair 'til we're in. I don't want the Slayer  tracking anyone to the tunnel. And  that means you, Harm. You're an  indoor kitty now.
HARMONY: But, Spike, you said you'd take me places!  You said we'd go to France and now  I can't even leave the lair?
SPIKE: Listen to me, you stupid bint. This gem  is everything. I came back to Sunnydale  for it. A place which has witnessed some  truly spectacular kickings of my arse.  The very sound of the name burns  along my nerve endings. Do you get it?  I hate Sunnydale more than life itself.  Now, when I have the Gem, they all  die, don't worry, but until then, <u>stay</u>
 <u>inside</u>. And, by the way, I would be  insanely happy if, from this point on,  I heard bugger all about sodding <u>France</u>!
HARMONY: I don't know why I let you be so mean  to me.
SPIKE: (bitterly) Love hurts, baby.
SPIKE: (awed) It's real.
SPIKE: Nick whatever you want. I don't care.
HARMONY: Ew. Like you're too good to work a clasp.
SPIKE: Hang on.
HARMONY: What are you doing, you big freak?
SPIKE: That's my gem...
HARMONY: Fine! If that's all that matters to you,  then take it. <u>Take it and get out</u>!
SPIKE: Good idea. I think I'll go play outside.
OZ: Okay, I'm either borrowing all your  albums or I'm moving in.
GILES: Oz, there are more important things  than records right now.
OZ: More important than this one?
GILES: Yes, well, I suppose an argument  could be made...
XANDER: Whoa. Giles has a TV. Everybody look  at this, Giles has a TV! He's shallow  like us!
OZ: Gotta admit, a little disappointed.
GILES: I'm not-- It's not--
WILLOW: Maybe it doesn't work. It's like, art.
GILES: I-- Public television-- Look, everyone,  we have vital work to do. Television  isn't going to help us now.
OZ: Tunneling.
GILES: Spike. Come on. Xander, find Buffy  and meet us there.
PARKER: (to the girl) I mean, it hit me hard, you know, my dad.  And since then I just don't put stuff off  anymore. It's about living for now.
BUFFY: Parker?
PARKER: Buffy! Buffy Summers, this is  Katie Loomis.
BUFFY: (hurt) Parker, what's going on?
PARKER: Hey, Katie, you're gonna be late for  class. I'll catch up, okay?
BUFFY: She's a friend of yours?
PARKER: Yeah. You'd like her a bunch. So,  what's up?
BUFFY: Well, you, sort of, didn't call. I mean,  I understand if you've been busy or  sick or something.
PARKER: It's only been a couple of days.  You need to talk to me about something?
BUFFY: Well, is... is everything... okay?
PARKER: Sure it is.
BUFFY: It is?
PARKER: Sure.
BUFFY: Oh. So, do you maybe want to go  do something?
PARKER: We can do that. Absolutely.  BUFFY Great. Tonight?
PARKER: Well, the thing is, I think I'm sort of  getting together with some people later.
BUFFY: Parker? Did I...
PARKER: Sorry to rush you, just, late for class.
BUFFY: Did I do something-- something wrong?
PARKER: Something wrong? No, of course not.  It was fun. Didn't you have fun? (joking) Watch out how you answer, my  ego's fragile.
BUFFY: I-- You had fun. Is that all it was?
PARKER: Okay, I'm a little confused now. I mean,  I definitely got the idea you'd done it  before. You were one who was all over  me. It was fun. What else was it  supposed to be?
BUFFY: It seemed like you... liked me?
PARKER: I do. But I'm starting to feel like you  thought that meant, what? Some kind  of commitment? Is that really what  you want right now?
BUFFY: I just thought, you know...
PARKER: I'm sorry if you misunderstood something.  I thought things were pretty clear.
BUFFY: I-- I didn't mean-- I'm sorry.
PARKER: Look, I really have to go now.
BUFFY: Parker, wait. I did this all wrong.
PARKER: I'll give you a call sometime.
SPIKE: Innit a fantastic day? Birds singing,  squirrels making lots of rotten little  squirrels, sun beaming down in a nice,  non-fatal way. It's very exciting, I can't  wait to find out if I freckle.
BUFFY: The gem.
SPIKE: Oh yeah. The Gem of Amarra.
WILLOW: (gently) Harmony...?
HARMONY: (gasping through tears) Being a vampire sucks.
XANDER: Buffy!
ANYA: Xander. I've been looking for you.  You weren't in your musty basement.
XANDER: Have you seen Buffy.
ANYA: No. (then, shyly) About what happened. See, when I  said I was over you--
XANDER: (didn't hear a word) Anya-- I don't have time.
GILES: Harmony? Where's Spike?
HARMONY: He staked me and he took it. Tried to  take it right off my finger. Like I wouldn't  have just give it to him? I'd've given  him anything he wanted. He was my  platinum baby and I loved him.
GILES: Where did he go?
SPIKE: Getting tired Slayer?
BUFFY: I'm okay. How 'bout you? Sun in  your eyes?
SPIKE: A little. Awfully bright, disorienting...  oh, no, I lied. I'm fine.
BUFFY: You're a pig Spike.
SPIKE: Did he play the sensitive lad and get  <u>you</u> to seduce <u>him</u>? Good trick if the  girl's thick enough to buy it.
BUFFY: Really? Let's see.
WILLOW: I like it.
OZ: It's small.
XANDER: Quite tasteful. Really worth getting  my ribs bashed in.
GILES: So the question now is, what do we do  with it? It's obviously extremely  dangerous and destroying it--
BUFFY: We don't destroy it.
GILES: But, Buffy, any vampire who gets this  is essentially unkillable... Oh...
OZ: I have that gig in L.A. I could swing by.
BUFFY: Thanks, Oz.
XANDER: What's going on? What's in L.A.?
WILLOW: (aside to Xander) She's giving it to Angel. Don't make  a fuss.
GILES: Buffy, are you sure?
BUFFY: He should have this.
BUFFY: So what I'm wondering is, does this  always happen? Sleep with a guy and  he goes all evil?
WILLOW: Well, from what I understand, pretty  much. But it won't always be like that.  You've just had some really bad luck.
BUFFY: I don't know, Will. Bad luck just happens.  I made this happen.
WILLOW: Well, why shouldn't you, if it's what  you want? I mean, as long as it's safe.  Oh, Buffy, it was safe, wasn't it?
BUFFY: It was safe. It's not that. It's that the  whole time, I kept thinking, hey, look  at me with someone who isn't Angel.  Look how much I'm not hung up on  Angel anymore. Look how this is not  <u>all</u> about Angel. God, how come I  didn't see it?
WILLOW: Well, maybe you made a mistake, but  that's okay. Next time-- (off Buffy's look) What?
BUFFY: (sentimental) Parker said it was okay to make mistakes.  It was sweet.
WILLOW: No it wasn't. He said that so you'd take  a chance and sleep with him. He's a  poop-head.
BUFFY: I know. He's manipulative and shallow  and why doesn't he want me? If there  was something totally repulsive about  me, you'd tell me, right?
WILLOW: I'm your friend. I'd call you repulsive in a second.
BUFFY: Maybe me and Parker could still work  it out. Do you think we could still work  it out?
WILLOW: You're missing something about the  whole "poop-head" principle.
BUFFY: You go on up. I'm gonna walk.
WILLOW: You sure?
BUFFY: How come it's never easy?
