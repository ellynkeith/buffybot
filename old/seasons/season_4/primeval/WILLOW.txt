Hey.
Right.
I forgot my laptop and the disks. (off his blank look) The encrypted disks Spike stole  from the Initiative? I still need to  decode them.
No, that's okay.
Got 'em.
So… See you.
Okay… Bye.
Can't. Not now. I think I'm onto  something. I've been assuming the  ciphertext was encrypted with an  asymmetric algorithm. Then it hit me:  a hexagonic key-pattern. It's - (off her look) I'm scaring you now, huh?
I didn't. I haven't even  finished putting in the new code.
It must be programmed to  self-decrypt at a certain point. (irked) That's so annoying. It's like  someone blurting out the  answer to a riddle just when you -
I mean - yippie! - we have the information.
And I don't think Tara felt welcome.
I - well -  (a little sheepish) Spike - specifically. But -
Me too.
So - why do you think Spike made  with the head games?
Oh! Hey - I decrypted them! (grumpy admission) Well. They decrypted themselves  but I almost had it.
A bunch of stuff we already knew  about 314 - but it also said there's  some "final phase" where Adam  manufactures a bunch of creepy  cyber-demonoids just like him.  There's a special lab down in the  Initiative, but it didn't say where it was.
(nods) Hidden somewhere.
What do you mean?
…and Adam gets neat piles of parts to  start building his army. Diabolical yet gross.
Riley?
What about magic? Some kind of…  I don't know, uranium extracting spell. (squinting) I know. I'm reaching.
Right. Don't you have to speak it in  Sumerian or something?
(to Xander) Nervous?
Super. What was I thinking,  using stairs all this time?
Really, Buffy, it's not as scary  as I thought.
It's not your fault. Spike stirred up trouble.
(it's hard to admit) Maybe a little. But, you know, first  year of college. Hard to keep the  high school gang together.
You're the slayer, Buffy. Your stuff is  pretty crucial.
I wasn't exactly Ms. Available either.  I kept secrets. I hid things from everyone.
I wanted to tell you. But I was so scared…
Me too. I love you too.
I promise. I promise…
Xander! Wonderful Xander!
We do. Totally.
No - we just missed you.
It's a gourd.
Including the secret lab?
On it.
(re: monitor) Hold on, hold on, look at this.  According to this, there's air  ducts and electrical conduits all running into… (points) … there.
So, there's no there there. Look.
I don't have to. Every lock in the  Initiative's been disengaged. (looking up) Except the exits.
How do we open it?
Long as we don't get all blowed up or nothin'.
(reading) By the generous will of the  Ancients, the almighty power  of the Divine Spirits… Your  supplicants humbly beseech thee  to behold us, and that which we  possess… the moieties of the  One, the Avatar…
Spiritus… The Spirit…
And Manus. The Hand.
We enjoin that we may inhabit  the vessel - the hand -  daughter of Sineya, First of the Ones.
We implore thee: Admit us,  bring us to the vessel! Take us <u>now</u>!
Wow… That -- that was…
Wasn't it amazing?
You up to this?
