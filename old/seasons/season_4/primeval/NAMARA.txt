Shut up. Got some nerve, lady.
You think you and your friends can  just keep waltzing into a government  installation, brandishing weapons like, like-
What kind of freaks are you people?
Nice try.
Every inch of this installation is under  constant, twenty-four hour surveillance.
(brusquely) Including <u>everything</u>! (then) What secret lab?
I know everything that goes on around  here. A tick on a mouse couldn't get in  without my knowing it. And if Adam  wants to try, we're ready for him.
Hit him simultaneously with multiple taser  blasters. Incapacitate him with as much  voltage as we can muster.
You telling me my business?

Maybe up there. Down here I'm the one in control.

You menâ€¦ follow me. We have to take  the armory. Now!
(barks to guards) These people are under arrest. Do you understand?
Fall back! Fall back! Protect  the flank gunners and lock  down that pit!
