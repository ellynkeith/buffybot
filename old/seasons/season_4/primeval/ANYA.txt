You said you wanted to check the  board at the unemployment office  this morning.
You can't go this way. They won't  even interview you if you're naked.
Don't they make you get up really  early in the morning?
Are you still upset about the  fight you had with your friends?
That was hours ago. Get over it.
So they all think you're a lost,  directionless loser with no plan  for his future. (dismissing it) Pfff.
Why not?
So what if they are? You're a good  person and a good boyfriend and you  do amazing things with your tongue  and I'm in love with you.
Whatever they think of you, it shouldn't matter.
