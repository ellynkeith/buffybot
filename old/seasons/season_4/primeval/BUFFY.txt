What are you doing here?
Adam's been using these caves.  I found his lair.
(wheels turning) And Adam's cleared out of here.  Whatever he's planning, it's  about to go down.
The disks? Oh, I - Willow has them.
Right…
(to Xander) Where's Anya?
Why? Because of the things we said? (off Will's hurt nod) Will - who told you we were  talking behind your back. Specifically?
(to Xander) And who told you we thought  you'd be better off joining the army?
He played us. He wanted us to  fight. To split us up.
That's where it all came from.  The stuff we said the other night.
Good. Great.
I think it's more than that. I think it's Adam.
I went to Adam's lair just now. Adam  was gone and Spike "just happened" to  be there. He made a big noise about  how I should check out the  information on those encrypted disks -
Adam fed Spike the disks. It has to be.  He wants me to know all about his evil  guy assembly line. (things clicking in her head) And this lab is <u>in</u> the Initiative?
(has got it) Give this demon his due. He thought this one out.
You know how the Initiative has been  so overcrowded? Those demons were  too easy to catch. It's like they wanted  <u>in</u> that place -
The demons are going to attack  the Initiative from inside.
I gotta shut him down, Giles. The  final phase is about to start.
They won't listen to me.
He's a deserter. Anyway he… he got  some bad news, kinda took off.  Which is fine with me.
Oh, he wants me down there. Probably  figures I'll even out the kill ratio.
(concerned) He's really not.
According to Riley, Adam's power source  comes from a uranium core embedded  somewhere inside his chest. Probably near the spine.
What was I thinking?
Game faces, guys. We're going in.
How you doing?
Okay. Good. (a beat/then) Will…
No. I was going to say… I'm  sorry. I hate that things have been  so strained between all of us.
But - I think trouble was stir  up-able. I think we've all sort  of drifted apart this year… (off her silence) Don't you?
But I <u>want</u> it together. I miss you,  and Xander - and Giles. (then) And it is my fault. I've been a bad friend. I got so caught up in my own stuff.
I mean Riley. And - Riley, mostly.
That's not your fault. I mean, you were  going through something huge -
You can tell me anything, Willow.  I love you. You're my best friend.
Let's promise to never not talk again -
Xander!
Xander - you know we love you, right?
(sotto) Okay. If we stick together, we'll  be fine. Everybody ready?
Good. Let's -
…do this.
Colonel -
You've got to listen -
Adam is here, Colonel. In the Initiative.
Those overcrowded containment  cells of yours? Compliments of  Adam. He's pulling a Trojan Horse  on you, Colonel. Waiting for his moment -
The one Adam's using. The one built  for the final stage in the 314 project. (off his look) And you have no idea what I'm talking  about, do you?
I've seen Adam hit with a taser blast,  Colonel. He feeds on it. And now  you want to provide him with an  all-you-can-eat buffet.
This isn't your business. It's mine. You,  the Initiative, the boys at the Pentagon…  You're in way over heads. Messing with  primeval forces you've got no comprehension of.
I'm the Slayer. You're playing on my turf.
It's Adam.
I'm the only one who can stop him now  and you know it. Let me handle Adam.  You just get your people out of here.
Colonel -
We've got to find Adam.
First things first…
How we doing, Will?
So?
It's Adam.
Right behind room 314.
(to Willow) Can you unlock it?
Great. So we know we're going to 314. Now all we have to do is get there.
Come on!
It's here.
Once I'm in - barricade it. Giles -  this place okay to be Magic Central?
How long before the ritual kicks in?
I'll move fast, then.
I won't be.
Riley?
Are you hurt? Say something.
Riley? What is this? Why  won't you talk to me?
Me?
Sorry - Maybe it's the slayer in me,  but I don't jump through hoops on  command. I've never been one to tow the line.
(to Riley) I need to get to Adam. Like now. Are you able --?
Yeah, well, Professor Walsh  was no dummy. A little light  on the sanity, yeah -
Broke your arm.
We can. We are forever.
(Sumerian) sha me-en-dan. Gesh-toog  me-en-dan. Zee me-en-den.  Oo-khush-ta me-ool-lee-a  ba-ab-tum-mu-do-en.
(English translation) We are heart. We are mind.  We are spirit. From the raging  storm, we bring the power of  the Primeval One.
(Sumerian) Im-a sheng-ab.
(English translation) Boil the air.
(Sumerian) Kur.
(English translation) Change.
You could never hope to  grasp the source of our power.
But yours is right here.
We were great.
You guys get to the exits, get  'em open somehow. Riley, try  and organize the soldiers, pull  'em back. I'll take point.
I seriously am.
