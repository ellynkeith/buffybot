BUFFY: (to vamp) Thanks for the re-locate. I perform  better without an audience.
SPIKE: Watch your mouth, little girl. You should  know better than to tempt the fates that  way. Because the Big Bad is back - and  this time, it's GNYAARGGHHLL!!
WILLOW: It's more fun here this year, isn't it?  The Bronze?
BUFFY: (agreeing) 'Cause of the gloating factor alone.  We're all about college now.  We've got heady discourse...
OZ: Curfew free nights of mom and  pop-less hootenanny...
XANDER: Co-ed dating prospects who find  "townies" sexy and dangerous... (off Willow's look) What? I can dream.
BUFFY: Right... So, if college is so great - what  are we doing here and why is it more fun?
WILLOW: Because the Bronze is nice and familiar.  It's like a big comfy blanky.
OZ: I was under the impression that I was  your big comfy blanket. 
WILLOW: You're my <u>person</u> blanky. This is my  <u>place</u> blanky. With all the shock of the  new it's nice to know that there's one  spot we can come back to where things  are predictable and-  GILES (interrupting her) Hello, all.
BUFFY: Giles. Trouble?
GILES: Oh no - don't get up Buffy. It's nothing  like that. I just thought I'd pop by...  Anybody for a latte? On me?
BUFFY: (to Willow) So much for your predictable blanky  theory, Will.
GILES: Splendid. It's been ages since I've  been out to hear a band...
BUFFY: (bemused) But it's your cutting edge 8-tracks that  keep you ahead of the scene.
OZ: (to others) Might want to save the scoffing, gang.  I've seen the collection, and Giles was  an animal in his day.
BUFFY: I guess... If the Stones are still rolling, why can't Giles?  WILLOW (to Giles) Exactly, I think it's brave that you're here.
GILES: (a bit peeved) Well - thank you, all. You've made  me feel right at home.
XANDER: Isn't home that empty place you're  trying to escape?
WILLOW: Oh. Yea... Veruca's playing tonight.
OZ: Yeah. Every Wednesday. I told you.
BUFFY: So Oz, what about you guy?  When's Dingoes playing here again?
OZ: What? Oh - we're up next Friday...
WILLOW: (anxious/re: band) They're good, aren't they?
OZ: Nothing special.
BUFFY: Yeah. She's quell' Fiona. Color  me bored.
GILES: Really? I think she's rather remarkable.  Such a presence for someone her age...
WILLOW: It's in the sandblaster!
OZ: What's the sandblaster, Will?
WILLOW: Hmmmmmm.... (grins) Ooooooh.... (then) All Geminis to the raspberry hats!
OZ: Now you're faking.
WILLOW: Am not.
OZ: Morning.
WILLOW: Morning.
OZ: Bad dream?
WILLOW: I guess. But the waking up part  makes up for it.
OZ: It's always so busy in there.
WILLOW: (suggestively) Not always. A few things shut my  brain up completely.
OZ: Anything I can help you with?
WILLOW: I have to get to class right now.  But tonight, for sure.
OZ: I don't know about tonight. Unless the  extreme Jerry Garcia look turns you on. (off her puzzled look) Night before the full moon.
WILLOW: Oh! That's right. And I have a thing...  There's a wicca group on campus I  wanted to check out, they have  orientation on the three nights you're  wolfy. It's probably totally silly, but-
OZ: (cutting her off) Go. Show them how it's done.
WILLOW: Are you sure? You can lock yourself up?  I mean, it's only this one month. After  orientation they meet on different nights-
OZ: Will, I'll be fine.
WILLOW: Okay... As long as you don't mind.
OZ: The only part I mind is being away  from your for three nights.
WALSH: Ms. Summers. I want you to prepare  to lead a discussion group next class  on the paper topic. (re: Buffy's paper) That was smart work.
BUFFY: It - I... What do I-
WALSH: You have any questions, bring them  up with one of the TA's.
WILLOW: Are you okay? How'd you do?
BUFFY: I know - can you believe it!?
WILLOW: Guess Ms. Walsh isn't so ogrey after all.
BUFFY: Except now she wants me to lead a  discussion group next class. Which  means more work, right? Shouldn't  she have a better reward system?  Like a cookie? Or maybe a little toy,  like at the dentist?
WILLOW: (blown away) She wants you to lead a discussion group?  Okay - jealous again. Jealous, jealous...  I'm back. (then) I'm meeting Oz at the caf√©. You want to  come? I'll get you your celebratory cookie.
BUFFY: Great. I'm TA bound - but I'll catch  up with you guys. 
VERUCA: What are you going to do? Sit on  the ground?
OZ: My girlfriend's coming.
VERUCA: There's room.
OZ: Big lunch. 
VERUCA: (shrugs) I like to eat. I hate chicks who are all -  "does that have dressing on it?"
OZ: Agreed.
VERUCA: I guess. The set's starting to come together -  but the amps still sound dirty to me...
OZ: What are you using? 50 or 120?
WILLOW: Hey!
VERUCA: Hey...
OZ: You should be using 50. And Blue  Voodoo isn't your best bet if you don't  dig the distort.
WILLOW: Music talk, huh? Cool. I love to listen  to Oz talk about "the biz."
VERUCA: (ignoring/to Oz) What do you like, again? I know  you told me.
OZ: There are a couple of good ones.  The Johnson Mil...
VERUCA: My #1 has to be Redbone.
OZ: #1? I gotta go with Hound Dog...
WILLOW: Me too! That was a great song. I mean,  Elvis - what a guy.
VERUCA: (bemused) You a big Elvis fan?
WILLOW: The biggest. Well, I mean, after Dingoes.
OZ: We were actually talking amps... (off Will's embarrassment) But it's easy to get confused, with the  names they give them.
WILLOW: Oh.
OZ: (to both of them) I have to bail. (to Willow) Call me later.
VERUCA: I should go too. Good shirt.
WILLOW: Me. I don't speak "muscianese." (then) Why didn't you tell me I look like a  crazy birthday cake in this shirt?
BUFFY: Oh. I thought that was the point.
WILLOW: He thinks she's sexy. He gets this blushy  thing going on behind his ears. That's  for me only.
BUFFY: (sympathetic) It doesn't mean anything, Will. So Oz  checks another girl. He loves you.
WILLOW: I know. I know. And I don't want to be  the kind of girl who freaks every time  my boyfriend notices someone else -  even if she is throwing herself at him  like a twenty dollar ho...
BUFFY: Please. Ten dollar ho. Fifteen, max.
WILLOW: I mean, I have wrong feelings for other  guys sometimes...
BUFFY: You have them. But you don't act  on them.
WILLOW: No. In fact, I feel guilty about them. I flog and punish.
BUFFY: See? I'm sure Oz is flogging and  punishing himself- (stops) This is sounding so wrong before I  even finish. (then) Point is - you're both human. But I  promise you, in a few days it'll be  like - Veruca who?
WILLOW: You think?
BUFFY: Absolutely. Oz just isn't the type to stray.
WILLOW: (still worried) Not tonight, anyway. He'll be locked  in a cage...
WALSH: Hello?
WALSH: God...
VERUCA: Morning.
OZ: Morning.
VERUCA: That was some night.
OZ: So it appears.
VERUCA: Right... You don't remember. It's like  that at first. But after a while, bits and  pieces start coming back to you.
OZ: So you're...
VERUCA: A werewolf groupie. Nobody else  gets it done for me.
OZ: What?
VERUCA: Kidding. You know what I am. You've  known since the first time you saw me.
VERUCA: God. The kids in this dorm need  Fashion 101 in a bad way...
OZ: Not making a statement. Just trying to  get back to my place. I want to know  why we both got out of our cages and-
VERUCA: (scoffing) You have a cage?
OZ: Don't you?
VERUCA: Yeah. It has a little wheel and a cute  plastic ball with a bell in it. (then) God. Somebody's domesticated the  hell out of you.
OZ: It's my choice. I don't want to hurt anybody.
VERUCA: Maybe. Or maybe you don't want to  admit what happened to you. Maybe  you want to pretend you're just a  regular guy...
OZ: I am. I'm only a wolf three nights a month.
VERUCA: Or you're the wolf <u>all the time</u>, and  your human face is just your disguise.  Ever think of that?
OZ: I'm going. I have to check the paper.  See if we did any damage last night.
VERUCA: We did - but only to each other. I know  some part of you remembers that.
OZ: (firmly) But we aren't going to. It ends. Now.
VERUCA: I can help you, Oz. You're scared. I was  too. But now I accept it. The animal.  And it's powerful... Inside me all the time. (then) Soon you'll feel sorry for other people.  They only wish they could be as alive  as we are. As free-
OZ: Free to kill people? I won't do that.  And you shouldn't either.
VERUCA: You don't understand. But you will.  And you'll see that we belong together.
OZ: No. I know where I belong.
VERUCA: See you tonight.
WALSH: It was unbelievable. <u>Two</u> of them.  That I survived at all is a miracle-
BUFFY: Excuse me, Ms. Walsh-
WALSH: I hope you're being careful when you  walk on campus after dark. I was  attacked by wild dogs last night.
BUFFY: Wild dogs.
RILEY: Two of them.
WALSH: Biggest tings I've ever seen. The first  one, I thought it was... well for a moment,  I thought it was a gorilla. My heart  practically stopped. (to Buffy) I know how it sounds. But crazy is my  specialty - and I definitely saw what  I saw.
BUFFY: No. I believe you.
RILEY: Did you have a question, Buffy?
BUFFY: (distracted) No... Thanks. Just saying howdy.
WALSH: Fine. See you in class.
WILLOW: Hey.
OZ: Hey. New look.
WILLOW: (re: his outfit) You too.
OZ: Oh. Laundry day... kinda came and went.
WILLOW: Hey. I'm sorry if I was weird yesterday.  With you and Veruca.
OZ: (tighter) I didn't notice anything.
WILLOW: You didn't? Cause I felt all spazzy.
OZ: No.
WILLOW: Oh. Good. Guess I've been worrying  for nothing again. Me and my busy head... (hinting) Always thinking, thinking, thinking...
OZ: Now you can stop. Everything's fine.
WILLOW: Well. Maybe you can... help me stop.
OZ: Sorry, I-
WILLOW: You don't want to?
OZ: It's not that. I do. But...
WILLOW: No. It's fine. I don't have that much  time anyway-
OZ: It's just - I didn't sleep at all I guess.  I'm really beat.
WILLOW: Right. Busy wolf night. Got it.  It's totally okay.
OZ: Will. You don't have to-
WILLOW: No. I should. I'll see you later.
GILES: Treaty of Westphalia!
GILES: Moron. That dinette set should be mine.
BUFFY: Hi...
GILES: Can I get you anything? Some tea?  I made an interesting mousaka last  night if you're hungry.
BUFFY: Pass on the tea. And the moose. But thanks.
GILES: So. You come on business, I hope?
BUFFY: Yep. Lucky for you, people may be  in danger.
GILES: I didn't... I only meant - I'm at the ready.
BUFFY: Clearly - we need to get you kicking  some monster bootie, stat. So check it -  one of my professors said she almost got  attacked by two wild "dogs" last night.  Under the light of a nearly full moon.
GILES: Werewolves? Two of them?
BUFFY: Could be.
GILES: I didn't see anything about attacks in  the paper or on the news. Have you  spoken to Oz?
BUFFY: He's my next stop.
GILES: Yes. Get right on that. And I'll see  what I can find out.
BUFFY: (finishing for him) ASAP. Promise.
XANDER: Hey, Will. Mom let you in?
WILLOW: Uh huh... Seemed a little cranky.
XANDER: We're having a little landlord/tenant  dispute, so I'm withholding rent. An  effective - and might I add thrifty - tactic.
WILLOW: How come?
XANDER: She won't let me put a lock on my door.  I suspect she's afraid I'll start having  "the sex."
WILLOW: Yeah. Parents wait until you're out  of the house-
XANDER: Or under it-
WILLOW: Or under it - to start worry about that  stuff. And it's mostly too late...
XANDER: So I know why I'm sitting around in a  dank, sunless little room - but why you?
WILLOW: I just... Things with Oz are weird. I  talked with Buffy, but I have a feeling  we're in guy-ville... Like I need a  translator from the Y wide of things.
XANDER: Last time I checked I had the creds.  Hit me.
WILLOW: What does it mean when a girl wants  to... you know...
XANDER: If you're doing it I think you should  be able to say it.
WILLOW: Make love...
XANDER: Wild monkey love or tender Sarah  McLachlan love?
WILLOW: Any kind. But what if the girl wants  to and the guy doesn't? That's a bad  sign, right?
XANDER: Could be. Or the girl caught the guy in  one of the 7 annual minutes when he's  legitimately too preoccupied to do it.
WILLOW: But say, the girl has been noticing-
XANDER: Will? I think I've deciphered your  ingenious code.
WILLOW: Oh. Say I've been noticing Oz notice  somebody else. A woman.
XANDER: And this chick is noticing back?
WILLOW: Most definitely.
XANDER: Well... Have you asked Oz about it?
WILLOW: Thought about it. But then he'll think  I'm all jealous and worried.
XANDER: But you <u>are</u>. And odds are he feels it.  I bet that's all there is to the weird  you're feeling.
WILLOW: Okay. Now that you said that - I knew it.  How come I didn't <u>know</u> I knew it  before you said it?
XANDER: Love. It's a logic blocker. (then) Talk it out with him, Will. You'll  both feel better.
BUFFY: Got out, huh?
OZ: Yeah... Any news about attacks?
BUFFY: No. But I did hear about a person being  chased by <u>two</u> "wild dogs."
OZ: Two? Really?
BUFFY: You don't remember anything like that,  do you? Another wolf?
OZ: (shakes his head) As soon as the change comes - I'm  gone. It's like a total blackout.
BUFFY: Must be spooky.
OZ: It is.
BUFFY: Sure.
OZ: Give this thing a go.
BUFFY: Seems good to me... (then/teasingly) If I find werewolf #2 on patrol tonight -  you may have a roomie.
OZ: Thanks.
BUFFY: Oz? (off his look) Are you alright? If possible, you seem  even more monosyllabic than usual.
OZ: I'm okay. Thanks.
VERUCA: So this is why you called me here?  To see your Habittrail?
OZ: (evenly) Come here.
VERUCA: I'm not getting in that stupid cage with  you, if that's what this is about. We  belong outside.
OZ: You can't run loose tonight. And not  just because you might hurt someone.  I know people who will be out there -  hunting for us.
VERUCA: Really? You should meet new people.
OZ: I'm serious.
VERUCA: So you're saying I should spend the  whole night with you. Alone.  Locked in a cage...
OZ: You'll be safe.
VERUCA: (knowingly) Not from you. Isn't that really the point  of this cozy arrangement?
OZ: I feel it.
VERUCA: I wanted you even before I saw you.  I sensed you. Did you sense me.
OZ: <u>Come here</u>.
VERUCA: Did you?
OZ: Willow-
WILLOW: Oh my God... Oh my God...
OZ: I know what you saw. It was... I had to -  I had to lock her up with me.
WILLOW: I bet. 
OZ: She's like me. A wolf.
WILLOW: (laughs darkly) Well, I knew you two had a lot in  common, but...
OZ: She was going to hurt somebody.  I didn't have a choice-
WILLOW: (cutting him off) But you did! You could have told somebody.  Your "solution" conveniently put you  two alone together all night.
VERUCA: Girl's got a point.
OZ: Leave.
VERUCA: I was just saying-
OZ: <u>Now</u>!
WILLOW: Why didn't you talk to me? I knew.  I <u>knew</u>, you jerk! And you sat there,  telling me everything was fine?  That's as bad as... As...
OZ: I know how it feels. I remember.
WILLOW: Oh, so, what? This is payback? I had  this coming.
OZ: No. That's not-
WILLOW: (cutting him off) Because I thought that was behind us.  And you know what happened with  Xander - it doesn't compare. Not with  what you and I had - and not with  <u>whatever</u> you've been doing with her.
OZ: I don't know what Veruca and I have  done. When I change - it's like I'm  gone and the wolf takes over.
WILLOW: But before this, when you were just  regular Oz - you had feelings for her,  didn't you?
OZ: I could sense something, yes. But-
WILLOW: But - you wanted her. Like, in an  animal way. (pained) Like - more than you wanted me.
BUFFY: Willow!
RILEY: Willow? Are you okay?
BUFFY: Thank you. I was too far away-
RILEY: It was lucky. She almost got...
BUFFY: (to Will) Willow. What's the matter?
RILEY: Maybe you should get her home.
BUFFY: I have to go. I have to find Veruca  before the sun sets.
WILLOW: No.
BUFFY: I'll come back as soon as things are  taken care of. You just take it easy, okay? (then) Riley was right. The main thing is -  put the blame where it belongs.  Don't hurt yourself.
WILLOW: I'm fine. Promise.
OZ: You haven't seen her around?  Okay. Thanks man.
BUFFY: Where is she?
OZ: I don't know. I already tried her usual haunts. (then) But - I know the areas we're drawn to,  and I'm pretty sure I can follow her scent.
BUFFY: We'll try that, then.
OZ: Look. You should just know that-
BUFFY: (cutting him off) Oz. This might be a good time for  your trademark stoicism.
WILLOW: I conjure thee, by Barabbas, by Satanas,  and the Devil As thou art burning,  let Oz' and Veruca's deceitful hearts  be broken.
OZ: This way.
WILLOW: I conjure thee by the Saracen Queen,  and by the name of hell. Let them  know no love or solace, let them  find no peace as well.
OZ: She's right near here. I can smell her.
BUFFY: Or the dirty pile of clothes she left  lying on the ground. 
OZ: They could be from the other night  when she-
BUFFY: Unless she <u>wanted</u> to throw you off  the scent.
OZ: Willow.
WILLOW: Let this image seal his fate, not to  love - but only hate...
VERUCA: Sometimes you have to, you know,  to keep what's yours. (darkly) Sometimes you have to kill.
VERUCA: Can't say I'm surprised you didn't go  through with your little hex. You don't have the teeth.
WILLOW: You don't know what I have. You don't  know anything about me. 
VERUCA: I know what you love. I have his scent  on me right now.
OZ: Don't touch her again.
VERUCA: Come stop me. I like it rough, remember?
OZ: You want to hurt me, hurt me.  But leave her out of this.
VERUCA: How can I? She's the reason you're  living in cages. She's blinding you!  When she's gone, you'll be able to  admit what you are-
OZ: You don't want to find out what I am.
VERUCA: You're an animal. Animals kill.
OZ: You're right. (he turns to Veruca) We kill.
WILLOW: Oz?..
GILES: I'm not sure I understand.
BUFFY: There was so much going on with Oz  and Will - there still is - but I thought  you should know about this.
GILES: So this fellow in the woods - he was  in military garb?
BUFFY: And he was toting some serious weaponry... (then) Thing is, I saw some other guys dressed  exactly like him on Halloween night.  I assumed they were in costume...
GILES: But maybe they were working.
BUFFY: I wanna know what's up. Guy got in  my way; I almost didn't catch up to  Oz in time. As it is, I was too late to...
GILES: You saved Willow.
BUFFY: I think right now she wishes I hadn't...  I've never seen her like this before,  Giles. It's like it hurts too much to  even form words.
GILES: But you've felt that way yourself,  and you got through it.
BUFFY: Well, I ran away and went to hell - and  then I got through it. I'm kind of hoping  Willow won't use me as a model.
GILES: Fair enough.
BUFFY: I just don't know how they're gonna  deal with this.
WILLOW: Hello?
OZ: Hi.
WILLOW: What are you doing?
OZ: I'm going.
WILLOW: Now?
OZ: That's my decision.
WILLOW: Don't I get any say in this?
OZ: No. (then) Veruca was right about something.  The wolf is inside me all the time. And  I don't know where the line is anymore -  between me and it. Until I figure out  what that means, I shouldn't be around  you - or anybody.
WILLOW: That could be a problem. 'Cause, people?  Pretty much a planetary epidemic.
OZ: I'll find someplace.
WILLOW: Well how long -
OZ: I don't know.
WILLOW: (desperate) Oz... Don't you love me...?
OZ: My whole life, I've never loved  anything else.
WILLOW: Oh God... Oz...
