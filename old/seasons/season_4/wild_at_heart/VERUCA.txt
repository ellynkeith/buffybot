What are you going to do? Sit on  the ground?
There's room.
(shrugs) I like to eat. I hate chicks who are all -  "does that have dressing on it?"
I guess. The set's starting to come together -  but the amps still sound dirty to me...
Hey...
(ignoring/to Oz) What do you like, again? I know  you told me.
My #1 has to be Redbone.
(bemused) You a big Elvis fan?
I should go too. Good shirt.
Morning.
That was some night.
Right... You don't remember. It's like  that at first. But after a while, bits and  pieces start coming back to you.
A werewolf groupie. Nobody else  gets it done for me.
Kidding. You know what I am. You've  known since the first time you saw me.
God. The kids in this dorm need  Fashion 101 in a bad way...
(scoffing) You have a cage?
Yeah. It has a little wheel and a cute  plastic ball with a bell in it. (then) God. Somebody's domesticated the  hell out of you.
Maybe. Or maybe you don't want to  admit what happened to you. Maybe  you want to pretend you're just a  regular guy...
Or you're the wolf <u>all the time</u>, and  your human face is just your disguise.  Ever think of that?
We did - but only to each other. I know  some part of you remembers that.
I can help you, Oz. You're scared. I was  too. But now I accept it. The animal.  And it's powerful... Inside me all the time. (then) Soon you'll feel sorry for other people.  They only wish they could be as alive  as we are. As free-
You don't understand. But you will.  And you'll see that we belong together.
See you tonight.
So this is why you called me here?  To see your Habittrail?
I'm not getting in that stupid cage with  you, if that's what this is about. We  belong outside.
Really? You should meet new people.
So you're saying I should spend the  whole night with you. Alone.  Locked in a cage...
(knowingly) Not from you. Isn't that really the point  of this cozy arrangement?
I wanted you even before I saw you.  I sensed you. Did you sense me.
Did you?
Girl's got a point.
I was just saying-
Sometimes you have to, you know,  to keep what's yours. (darkly) Sometimes you have to kill.
Can't say I'm surprised you didn't go  through with your little hex. You don't have the teeth.
I know what you love. I have his scent  on me right now.
Come stop me. I like it rough, remember?
How can I? She's the reason you're  living in cages. She's blinding you!  When she's gone, you'll be able to  admit what you are-
You're an animal. Animals kill.
