It's more fun here this year, isn't it?  The Bronze?
Because the Bronze is nice and familiar.  It's like a big comfy blanky.
You're my <u>person</u> blanky. This is my  <u>place</u> blanky. With all the shock of the  new it's nice to know that there's one  spot we can come back to where things  are predictable and-  GILES (interrupting her) Hello, all.
Oh. Yea... Veruca's playing tonight.
(anxious/re: band) They're good, aren't they?
It's in the sandblaster!
Hmmmmmm.... (grins) Ooooooh.... (then) All Geminis to the raspberry hats!
Am not.
Morning.
I guess. But the waking up part  makes up for it.
(suggestively) Not always. A few things shut my  brain up completely.
I have to get to class right now.  But tonight, for sure.
Oh! That's right. And I have a thing...  There's a wicca group on campus I  wanted to check out, they have  orientation on the three nights you're  wolfy. It's probably totally silly, but-
Are you sure? You can lock yourself up?  I mean, it's only this one month. After  orientation they meet on different nights-
Okay... As long as you don't mind.
Are you okay? How'd you do?
Guess Ms. Walsh isn't so ogrey after all.
(blown away) She wants you to lead a discussion group?  Okay - jealous again. Jealous, jealous...  I'm back. (then) I'm meeting Oz at the caf√©. You want to  come? I'll get you your celebratory cookie.
Hey!
Music talk, huh? Cool. I love to listen  to Oz talk about "the biz."
Me too! That was a great song. I mean,  Elvis - what a guy.
The biggest. Well, I mean, after Dingoes.
Oh.
Me. I don't speak "muscianese." (then) Why didn't you tell me I look like a  crazy birthday cake in this shirt?
He thinks she's sexy. He gets this blushy  thing going on behind his ears. That's  for me only.
I know. I know. And I don't want to be  the kind of girl who freaks every time  my boyfriend notices someone else -  even if she is throwing herself at him  like a twenty dollar ho...
I mean, I have wrong feelings for other  guys sometimes...
No. In fact, I feel guilty about them. I flog and punish.
You think?
(still worried) Not tonight, anyway. He'll be locked  in a cage...
Hey.
(re: his outfit) You too.
Hey. I'm sorry if I was weird yesterday.  With you and Veruca.
You didn't? Cause I felt all spazzy.
Oh. Good. Guess I've been worrying  for nothing again. Me and my busy head... (hinting) Always thinking, thinking, thinking...
Well. Maybe you can... help me stop.
You don't want to?
No. It's fine. I don't have that much  time anyway-
Right. Busy wolf night. Got it.  It's totally okay.
No. I should. I'll see you later.
Uh huh... Seemed a little cranky.
How come?
Yeah. Parents wait until you're out  of the house-
Or under it - to start worry about that  stuff. And it's mostly too late...
I just... Things with Oz are weird. I  talked with Buffy, but I have a feeling  we're in guy-ville... Like I need a  translator from the Y wide of things.
What does it mean when a girl wants  to... you know...
Make love...
Any kind. But what if the girl wants  to and the guy doesn't? That's a bad  sign, right?
But say, the girl has been noticing-
Oh. Say I've been noticing Oz notice  somebody else. A woman.
Most definitely.
Thought about it. But then he'll think  I'm all jealous and worried.
Okay. Now that you said that - I knew it.  How come I didn't <u>know</u> I knew it  before you said it?
Oh my God... Oh my God...
I bet. 
(laughs darkly) Well, I knew you two had a lot in  common, but...
(cutting him off) But you did! You could have told somebody.  Your "solution" conveniently put you  two alone together all night.
Why didn't you talk to me? I knew.  I <u>knew</u>, you jerk! And you sat there,  telling me everything was fine?  That's as bad as... As...
Oh, so, what? This is payback? I had  this coming.
(cutting him off) Because I thought that was behind us.  And you know what happened with  Xander - it doesn't compare. Not with  what you and I had - and not with  <u>whatever</u> you've been doing with her.
But before this, when you were just  regular Oz - you had feelings for her,  didn't you?
But - you wanted her. Like, in an  animal way. (pained) Like - more than you wanted me.
No.
I'm fine. Promise.
I conjure thee, by Barabbas, by Satanas,  and the Devil As thou art burning,  let Oz' and Veruca's deceitful hearts  be broken.
I conjure thee by the Saracen Queen,  and by the name of hell. Let them  know no love or solace, let them  find no peace as well.
Let this image seal his fate, not to  love - but only hate...
You don't know what I have. You don't  know anything about me. 
Oz?..
Hello?
What are you doing?
Now?
Don't I get any say in this?
That could be a problem. 'Cause, people?  Pretty much a planetary epidemic.
Well how long -
(desperate) Oz... Don't you love me...?
Oh God... Oz...
