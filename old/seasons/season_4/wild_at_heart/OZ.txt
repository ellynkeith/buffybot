Curfew free nights of mom and  pop-less hootenanny...
I was under the impression that I was  your big comfy blanket. 
(to others) Might want to save the scoffing, gang.  I've seen the collection, and Giles was  an animal in his day.
Yeah. Every Wednesday. I told you.
What? Oh - we're up next Friday...
Nothing special.
What's the sandblaster, Will?
Now you're faking.
Morning.
Bad dream?
It's always so busy in there.
Anything I can help you with?
I don't know about tonight. Unless the  extreme Jerry Garcia look turns you on. (off her puzzled look) Night before the full moon.
(cutting her off) Go. Show them how it's done.
Will, I'll be fine.
The only part I mind is being away  from your for three nights.
My girlfriend's coming.
Big lunch. 
Agreed.
What are you using? 50 or 120?
You should be using 50. And Blue  Voodoo isn't your best bet if you don't  dig the distort.
There are a couple of good ones.  The Johnson Mil...
#1? I gotta go with Hound Dog...
We were actually talking amps... (off Will's embarrassment) But it's easy to get confused, with the  names they give them.
(to both of them) I have to bail. (to Willow) Call me later.
Morning.
So it appears.
So you're...
What?
Not making a statement. Just trying to  get back to my place. I want to know  why we both got out of our cages and-
Don't you?
It's my choice. I don't want to hurt anybody.
I am. I'm only a wolf three nights a month.
I'm going. I have to check the paper.  See if we did any damage last night.
(firmly) But we aren't going to. It ends. Now.
Free to kill people? I won't do that.  And you shouldn't either.
No. I know where I belong.
Hey. New look.
Oh. Laundry day... kinda came and went.
(tighter) I didn't notice anything.
No.
Now you can stop. Everything's fine.
Sorry, I-
It's not that. I do. But...
It's just - I didn't sleep at all I guess.  I'm really beat.
Will. You don't have to-
Yeah... Any news about attacks?
Two? Really?
(shakes his head) As soon as the change comes - I'm  gone. It's like a total blackout.
It is.
Give this thing a go.
Thanks.
I'm okay. Thanks.
(evenly) Come here.
You can't run loose tonight. And not  just because you might hurt someone.  I know people who will be out there -  hunting for us.
I'm serious.
You'll be safe.
I feel it.
<u>Come here</u>.
Willow-
I know what you saw. It was... I had to -  I had to lock her up with me.
She's like me. A wolf.
She was going to hurt somebody.  I didn't have a choice-
Leave.
<u>Now</u>!
I know how it feels. I remember.
No. That's not-
I don't know what Veruca and I have  done. When I change - it's like I'm  gone and the wolf takes over.
I could sense something, yes. But-
You haven't seen her around?  Okay. Thanks man.
I don't know. I already tried her usual haunts. (then) But - I know the areas we're drawn to,  and I'm pretty sure I can follow her scent.
Look. You should just know that-
This way.
She's right near here. I can smell her.
They could be from the other night  when she-
Willow.
Don't touch her again.
You want to hurt me, hurt me.  But leave her out of this.
You don't want to find out what I am.
You're right. (he turns to Veruca) We kill.
Hi.
I'm going.
That's my decision.
No. (then) Veruca was right about something.  The wolf is inside me all the time. And  I don't know where the line is anymore -  between me and it. Until I figure out  what that means, I shouldn't be around  you - or anybody.
I'll find someplace.
I don't know.
My whole life, I've never loved  anything else.
