I think it's strange… I mean I think I should worry, that we haven't found her name.
You'd think she would have told us her name by now.
You're not worried?
You don't know everything about me…
(smiles) Oh, you know <b>that</b>…
They will find out, you know. About you.
Are you gonna finish in time for class?
But you've never taken drama before. You might miss something important.
Why not?
Things aren't going very well.
You don't understand yet, do you.
Yes.
The play's already started. That's not the point.
If they find out, you'll be punished. I can't help you with that.
Shhh…
We just think you're really interesting.
Do you wanna come in the back with us?
For who?
You lost them.
Oh, that clock's completely wrong.
Here.
You think yhou know. What's to come, what you are… You really have no idea.
Be back before dawn…
Of course not. That's the reason you came.
(agreeing) I was borrowed. Someone has to speak for her.
I don't.
You're asking the wrong questions.
I have no speech. No name. I live in the action of death. The blood- cry, the penetrating wound. I am destruction. Absolute. Alone.
The first.
The slayer doesn't walk in the world.
