It was nice meeting you… finally.
(to Buffy) Notice how pointedly I said 'finally?'
(setting down the tray) No, you guys have your fun. I'm tired… I can't believe you guys aren't exhausted -- have you even slept since…
Hey.
Oh, no. Anyway, they all left a while ago.
(smiles) I've heard that before.
Conquest?
What about comfort?
I do know the difference. I've learned about boys.
It's very late. Would you like to rest for a while?
Don't get lost…
Oh, hi, honey.
Oh, sweetie, no, I'm fine here. Don't worry about me.
Well, it seems that way to <u>you</u>… I made some lemonade, and I'm learning to play Mah Jong. You go find your friends.
Sorry dear. Sorry. A mouse is playing with my knees.
Well, you could probably break through the wall…
I'm guessing I missed some fun.
Oh. You want some hot chocolate?
Xander?
Will you be my kitchen buddy again? Help me carry?
