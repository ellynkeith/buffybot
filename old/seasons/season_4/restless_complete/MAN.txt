I've made a little space for the cheese slices…
These will not protect you…
What the hell is wrong with you? You won't come upstairs?
What are you, ashamed of us? You're mother's crying her guts out!
No, YOU don't understand! Life ends here, with us! You're not gonna change that. You haven't got the HEART.
I wear the cheese. It does not wear me.
