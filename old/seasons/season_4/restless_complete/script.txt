BUFFY: You're sure you'll be all right.
RILEY: Sure as I am of anything. Which is less and less, these days.
BUFFY: Cause I could be there in the morning --
RILEY: It's just a debriefing. They're not gonna make me disappear, and they're not pinning anything on me. I got Graham and a lot of the guys testifying I'm the reason they're alive. I might actually get out of this with an honorable discharge.
GILES: In return for your silence, no doubt.
RILEY: Oh yeah. Having the inside scoop on the administration's own Bay of Mutated Pigs is definitely an advantage.
WILLOW: Yeah, it's like you're blackmailing the government! (off Riley's look) In a patriotic way…
RILEY: (to Buffy) I'll call you when it's over.
XANDER: Dinner is served! My very own recipe.
WILLOW: You pushed the button on the microwave marked 'popcorn'?
XANDER: Actually, I pushed 'defrost.' But Joyce was there in the clinch.
RILEY: You guys have fun tonight. (to Joyce) It was nice meeting you.
JOYCE: It was nice meeting you… finally.
JOYCE: (to Buffy) Notice how pointedly I said 'finally?'
BUFFY: No…
XANDER: Let the vidfest begin!
GILES: (to Joyce) You sure you don't want to join us?
JOYCE: (setting down the tray) No, you guys have your fun. I'm tired… I can't believe you guys aren't exhausted -- have you even slept since…
GILES: Still feel a bit too wired.
WILLOW: Yeah, that spell, that was powerful.
BUFFY: I don't think I <u>could</u> sleep.
XANDER: Well, we got plenty of vid. And I'm putting in a preemptive bid for <u>Apocalypse Now</u>. Heh?
WILLOW: Did you get anything less Heart-of-Darknessy?
TARA: I think it's strange… I mean I think I should worry, that we haven't found her name.
WILLOW: Who? Miss Kitty?
TARA: You'd think she would have told us her name by now.
WILLOW: She will. She's not all grown yet.
TARA: You're not worried?
WILLOW: I never worry here. I'm safe here.
TARA: You don't know everything about me…
WILLOW: Have you told me your real name?
TARA: (smiles) Oh, you know <b>that</b>…
TARA: They will find out, you know. About you.
WILLOW: I don't have time to think about that. You know, I have all this homework to finish.
TARA: Are you gonna finish in time for class?
WILLOW: I can be late.
TARA: But you've never taken drama before. You might miss something important.
WILLOW: I don't want to leave here.
TARA: Why not?
WILLOW: It's so bright…
WILLOW: And there's something out there…
OZ: Hey.
WILLOW: Hi, guys.
OZ: Heard you're taking Drama.
WILLOW: Uh huh.
OZ: Tough course.
WILLOW: You took it?
OZ: Oh, I've been here forever.
XANDER: So, whatchya been doing? Doing spells? (to Oz) She does spells with Tara.
OZ: I heard about that.
WILLOW: I'm gonna be late.
XANDER: (sheepish) Sometimes I think about two women doing a spell… and then I do a spell by myself.
HARMONY: Isn't this exciting? Our first production! Oh…
HARMONY: I can't wait 'til our scene! I love you! Don't step on my cues.
WILLOW: Production?
BUFFY: Oh my god the place is packed. Everybody's here. (to Will, excited) Your whole family is in the front row -- and they look really angry!
WILLOW: There's a production?
HARMONY: Someone's got stage fright…
WILLOW: But isn't this the first class?
RILEY: Well you showed up late or you'd have a better part! I'm cowboy guy!
BUFFY: (to Will) Your costume is perfect. (conspiratorially) No one is ever gonna know the truth. You know, about you.
WILLOW: Find -- but -- costume?
BUFFY: Ooh, you're already in character. I should have done that.
WILLOW: But how come there's a -- I mean, I was given to understand that a drama class would have a, you know, drama class. We haven't even rehearsed --
HARMONY: Well maybe <b>some</b> people haven't…
RILEY: (aside, to Harmony) I was on time so I got to be cowboy guy.
WILLOW: I just think it's really early to be putting on a play. I don't even know what -- (panics) This isn't <b>Madam Butterfly</b>, is it? I have a whole problem with Opera.
GILES: All right, everyone, pay attention. In just a few moments that curtain will open on our very first production. Everyone Willow has ever met is in that audience, including all of us. That means we have to be perfect. Stay in character, remember your lines, and energy energy energy. Especially during the musical numbers.
WILLOW: (whispers) Did you guys see --
GILES: Remember, acting isn't about behaving. It's about hiding. The audience wants to find you, they want to strip you naked and eat you alive so HIDE.
GILES: Stop that. Costumes. Sets. The things, you know, things, you touch them and hold them --
HARMONY: Props?
GILES: No…
RILEY: Props.
GILES: Yes. It's all about subterfuge. (to Harmony) That's very annoying. (to the company) So get out there, lie like dogs and have a wonderful time. If we can stay focussed, keep our heads and if Willow can stop stepping on everybody's cues I know this will be the best production of Death of a Salesman we've ever done. (to Harmony) Stop it.
MAN: I've made a little space for the cheese slices…
TARA: Things aren't going very well.
WILLOW: Well, NO. Drama class is just, I think they're really not doing things in the proper way, and now I'm in a play and my whole family's her and why is there a cowboy in Death of a Salesman anyway?
TARA: You don't understand yet, do you.
WILLOW: Is there something following me?
TARA: Yes.
WILLOW: Well what should I do? The play's gonna start soon and I don't know my lines!
TARA: The play's already started. That's not the point.
RILEY: Why hello, little lady. Can I hold those milk pails for you?
HARMONY: Why thank you, but they are not very heavy. Why have you come to our lonely small town, which has no post office and very few exports?
RILEY: I've come looking for a man. (ominously, to the audience) A <b>sales</b>-man.
TARA: If they find out, you'll be punished. I can't help you with that.
WILLOW: But what's the… What's after me? Is it something I forgot to do? Was I supposed to --
TARA: Shhh…
WILLOW: (whisper) What is that…
WILLOW: Tara?
BUFFY: But what else could I expect from a bunch of low rent, no account hoodlums like you -- hoodlums! Yes. I mean you and your friends, your whole sex, throw 'em all in the sea for all I care, throw 'em in and wait for the bubbles. Men, with your groping and spitting, all groin no brain three billion of ya passin' around the same worn out urge. Men. With your… <b>sales</b>.
WILLOW: Tara… Okay, this really isn't fair --
BUFFY: Willow!
WILLOW: Buffy, oh, God…
BUFFY: Come on.
BUFFY: Stay low.
BUFFY: What did it look like?
WILLOW: I don't know. I don't know why it's after me.
BUFFY: Well you must have done something…
WILLOW: No! I never do anything! I'm very seldom naughty. I just came to class, and then the play was starting…
BUFFY: Play's long over. What are you still doing in costume?
WILLOW: Okay, still having to explain wherein this is just my outfit.
BUFFY: Willow, everybody already knows. Take it off.
WILLOW: No… No, I need it…
BUFFY: Oh, for God's sake just take it OFF.
BUFFY: That's better.
BUFFY: Well, that's a little more realistic.
HARMONY: See? Is everybody very clear on this now?
ANYA: (laughing) Oh my god! It's like a tragedy!
OZ: (to Tara) I tried to warn you…
ANYA: It's exactly like a greek tragedy. There should only be greeks.
WILLOW: (reciting) My book report. This summer, I read <b>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</b>…
XANDER: (to the ceiling) Oh, who <b>CARES</b>….?
WILLOW: This book has many themes. One of the first --
WILLOW: Help! Help me!
XANDER: I'm awake! I'm good. Did I miss anything?
GILES: Nothing much at all, really.
BUFFY: Bunch of massacring.
SOLDIER: We've got to keep going, men! We've got to take that hill. (keeps walking) Damn this war! (walks) Men? Oh my god, what's happened to my MEN!!!
GILES: I have to say, I really feel <b>Apocalypse Now</b> is over-rated.
XANDER: (staring, puzzled, at the screen) No, no… it gets better… I remember that it gets better…
BUFFY: You want some corn?
XANDER: Butter flavor?
BUFFY: New car smell.
XANDER: Cool.
XANDER: What's her deal?
BUFFY: Big faker.
GILES: I'm beginning to understand this now. It's all about the journey, isn't it?
XANDER: Well, thanks for making me have to pee.
BUFFY: You don't need any help, right?
XANDER: I got a system.
JOYCE: Hey.
XANDER: Hey, Joyce. Mrs. Summers.
XANDER: We're not making too much noise down there, are we?
JOYCE: Oh, no. Anyway, they all left a while ago.
XANDER: Oh. I should probably catch up.
JOYCE: (smiles) I've heard that before.
XANDER: I move pretty fast. You know, a man's always after…
JOYCE: Conquest?
XANDER: I'm a conquistador.
JOYCE: What about comfort?
XANDER: I'm a comfortador, also.
JOYCE: I do know the difference. I've learned about boys.
XANDER: That's cool about you.
JOYCE: It's very late. Would you like to rest for a while?
XANDER: Um, yeah. I'd like you. I'm just going to the bathroom first.
JOYCE: Don't get lost…
XANDER: Okay. I'm gonna find another bathroom.
XANDER: (calling out) I didn't order any vampires…
XANDER: That's not the way out…
XANDER: That's not the way out…
XANDER: Hey. There you are.
BUFFY: You sure it's us you were looking for?
SPIKE: Giles here is gonna teach me to be a Watcher. Says I got the stuff.
GILES: Spike's like a son to me….
XANDER: Well, that's good. I was into that for a while, but I got other stuff going on.
XANDER: Gotta have something. Gotta be always moving forward.
BUFFY: Like a shark.
XANDER: A shark with feet. And much less… fins.
SPIKE: AND on <b>land</b>.
GILES: Very good…
XANDER: Buffy, are you sure you want to play there? Pretty big sandbox.
BUFFY: I'm okay. It's not coming for <b>me</b> yet.
XANDER: I just mean… You can't protect yourself from… some stuff.
BUFFY: I'm way ahead of you, big brother.
XANDER: Brother?
GILES: Come on, put your back into it! A watcher scoffs at gravity!
ANYA: Do you know where you're going?
XANDER: North. To the mountains. The highest peak, the one they call "100 percent scary plummeting death." The test of a man.
ANYA: Do you know where you're going?
XANDER: No.
ANYA: I've been thinking about getting back into vengeance.
XANDER: Is that right?
ANYA: Well, you know I miss it, I'm so at loose ends since I quit and I think this is gonna be a very big year for vengeance.
XANDER: I don't know…
ANYA: I've been keeping close tabs on cultural trends -- a lot of Men being unfaithful -- very exciting things happening in the scorned women market. I don't wanna be left out.
XANDER: Yeah, but, isn't vengeance kind of… depressing?
ANYA: (petulant) You don't want me to have a hobby.
XANDER: Not a vengeance hobby, no. It's dangerous. People can't just do anything they want. Society has rules, and borders, and an endzone. It doesn't matter if…
XANDER: Do you mind? I'm talking to my demon.
WILLOW: Sorry.
TARA: We just think you're really interesting.
XANDER: (bravado) Oh, I'm goin' places.
WILLOW: I'm way ahead of you.
XANDER: Is that right?
WILLOW: Watch this.
TARA: Do you wanna come in the back with us?
ANYA: Oh, go on.
XANDER: I don't have to…
ANYA: I'll be fine. I think I've figured out how to steer by gesturing emphatically.
XANDER: I know what's up there!
MAN: These will not protect you…
XANDER: Giles!
GILES: Xander! What are you doing here?
XANDER: What's after me?
GILES: It's because of what we did. I know that.
XANDER: What we did?
GILES: The others have all gone ahead. Now listen carefully. Your life may depend on what I am about to tell you. You need to get to --
GILES: (french dubbing over:) -- the house where we're all sleeping. All your friends are there having a wonderful time and getting on with their lives. The creature can't hurt you there.
XANDER: What? Go where? I don't understand.
GILES: (still dubbed) Oh for God's sake, this is no time for your idiotic games!
ANYA: (with the dubbing) Xander! You have to come with us now! Everybody's waiting for you!
GILES: (dubly) That's what I've been trying to tell him.
XANDER: Honey, I don't -- I can't hear you…
ANYA: (dubbage) It's not important. I'll take you there.
XANDER: Well, wait. Where are we going?
XANDER: Hey! Let go! Hey!
SNYDER: Where you from, Harris?
XANDER: Well, the basement, mostly.
SNYDER: Were you born there?
XANDER: Possibly.
SNYDER: I walked by your guidance counselor's office one time, a bunch of you were sitting there, waiting to be… shepherded, to be guided. You and the other problems, glassy-eyed, slack-jawed, I remember it smelled like dead flowers. Like decay, and it hit me, yes, that's what it is; the hope of our nation's future is a bunch of mulch.
XANDER: You know, I never got the chance to tell you how glad I was you were eaten by a snake.
SNYDER: Where are you heading?
XANDER: Well, I'm supposed to meet Tara and Willow… and possibly Buffy's mom…
SNYDER: Do you know why they sent you here?
XANDER: Not 'sent' so much as 'manhandled', but… no.
SNYDER: Your time is running out.
XANDER: No, I'm in my prime. This is primetime.
SNYDER: Are you a soldier?
XANDER: I'm a comfortador.
SNYDER: You're neither. You're a whipping boy, raised by mongrels, and set on a sacrificial stone.
XANDER: I'm getting a cramp…
GILES: It's even more serious than I thought.
BUFFY: I can fight anything, right?
ANYA: Maybe we should slap her.
XANDER: Buffy?
XANDER: (whispers) That's not the way out…
MAN: What the hell is wrong with you? You won't come upstairs?
XANDER: I'm sorry…
MAN: What are you, ashamed of us? You're mother's crying her guts out!
XANDER: You don't understand…
MAN: No, YOU don't understand! Life ends here, with us! You're not gonna change that. You haven't got the HEART.
GILES: You have to stop thinking. Let it wash over you.
BUFFY: (amused) You don't think it's a little old fashioned?
GILES: This is the way women and men have behaved since the beginning, before time.
BUFFY: Come on! Come on!
BUFFY: We're gonna miss all the good stuff!
OLIVIA: Does she always want to train this badly?
GILES: It appears she never heard the fable about patience.
OLIVIA: Which one is that?
GILES: (tries to think) You know, with the fox, and the… less patient fox.
BUFFY: Ooh! Here! Can I? Can I?
GILES: Yes, go ahead.
GILES: Buffy, you have a sacred birthright to protect mankind. Don't stick out your elbow.
GILES: I haven't got any treats…
OLIVIA: For God's sake, Rupert, go easy on the girl.
GILES: This is my business. Blood of the lamb and all that. (to Buffy) Now, you're gonna get that all over your face.
GILES: (shocked, whispers) I know you…
SPIKE: (stage whisper) Come on! You're gonna miss everything!
GILES: Don't push me about, you know, I have a great deal to do.
SPIKE: I've hired myself out as an attraction.
GILES: Sideshow freak?
SPIKE: At least it's showbiz…
GILES: What am I supposed to do with all of this?
SPIKE: Gotta make up your mind, Rupes. What are you wasting time for? Haven't you figured it all out yet with your enormous squishy frontal lobes?
GILES: (starting to walk) I still think Buffy should have killed you.
MAN: I wear the cheese. It does not wear me.
GILES: Honestly, you meet the most appalling sort of people…
GILES: I'm sorry I'm so late. There's a great deal going on, all at once.
WILLOW: (peevish) Don't we know it. Only at death's door over here… Look at Xander!
XANDER: Got the sucking chest wound swinging… I promised Anya I'd be there for her big night. Now I'll probably be pushing up daisies in the sense of being in the ground underneath them and fertilizing the soil with my decomposition.
ANYA: Okay. A man walks into the office of a doctor. He is wearing on his head, a… there's a duck? Is that right?
ANYA: Quiet. You'll miss the humorous conclusion.
GILES: She seems to be doing quite well.
WILLOW: Do you even know this is your fault?
GILES: We have to think about the facts, Willow. I'm very busy. Have a gig myself, you know.
WILLOW: Something is trying to kill us. It's like some primal… some animal force.
GILES: That used to be us.
XANDER: Don't get linear on me now, man…
ANYA: And the duck tells the doctor, "there's a man that's attached to my ass."
ANYA: See, it was the duck and not the man that spoke.
WILLOW: Rupert, if we don't know what we're fighting, I don't think we have a chance.
GILES: (sings) It's strange. It's not like anything we've faced before, yet it seems familiar somehow. Of course! The spell we cast with Buffy must have released some primal evil, that's come back seeking… I'm not sure what. Willow, look through the Chronicles. Some reference to a warrior beast… Xander, help Willow and try not to bleed on my couch. We've got to warn Buffy. I tried her this morning but I only got her machine. Oh, wait…
GILES: Well, that was obvious.
GILES: (quietly terrified) I know who you are. And I can defeat you. With my intellect. Cripple you with my thoughts.
GILES: Of course you underestimate me. You couldn't know…
GILES: You never had a Watcher…
ANYA: Buffy, you have to wake up! Right away!
BUFFY: I'm not really in charge of these things…
ANYA: Please wake up oh please!
BUFFY: (turning onto her back) I need my beauty sleep, okay, so stop --
BUFFY: Faith and I just made that bed…
TARA: For who?
BUFFY: I thought you were here to tell me. The guys aren't here, are they? We were gonna hang out, watch movies.
TARA: You lost them.
BUFFY: No, I… I think they need me to find them.
BUFFY: It's so late…
TARA: Oh, that clock's completely wrong.
TARA: Here.
BUFFY: I'm never gonna use those.
TARA: You think yhou know. What's to come, what you are… You really have no idea.
BUFFY: I gotta find the others.
TARA: Be back before dawn…
BUFFY: Have you seen my friends anywhere? (looking around) They wouldn't just disappear; they're my very good friends.
BUFFY: Mom?
JOYCE: Oh, hi, honey.
BUFFY: Mom, why are you living in the walls?
JOYCE: Oh, sweetie, no, I'm fine here. Don't worry about me.
BUFFY: It looks dirty.
JOYCE: Well, it seems that way to <u>you</u>… I made some lemonade, and I'm learning to play Mah Jong. You go find your friends.
BUFFY: I think they're in trouble-danger…
JOYCE: Sorry dear. Sorry. A mouse is playing with my knees.
BUFFY: I really don't think you should live in there.
JOYCE: Well, you could probably break through the wall…
RILEY: Hey there, killer.
BUFFY: Riley! You're back!
RILEY: I never left.
BUFFY: How did the debriefing go?
RILEY: I told you not to worry about that! It went great. They made me Surgeon General.
BUFFY: Why didn't you come and tell me? We could have celebrated.
RILEY: Oh, we're drawing up a plan for world domination. The key element? Coffee makers that <u>think</u>.
BUFFY: World domination. Is that a good?
RILEY: Baby, we're the government. It's what we do.
ADAM: She's uncomfortable with certain concepts. It's understandable. (to Buffy) Aggression is a natural human tendency. Though you and me come by it another way.
BUFFY: We're not demons.
ADAM: Is that a fact?
RILEY: Buffy, we've got important work here. A lot of filing, and giving things names.
BUFFY: (to Adam) What was yours?
ADAM: Before Adam? Not a man among us can remember.
ADAM: This could be trouble.
RILEY: We'd better make a fort.
ADAM: I'll get the pillows.
BUFFY: No wait… I have weapons…
RILEY: If that's the way you want it baby, I guess you're on your on your own.
BUFFY: (whispers) I'm never gonna find them here…
TARA: Of course not. That's the reason you came.
BUFFY: You're not in my dream.
TARA: (agreeing) I was borrowed. Someone has to speak for her.
BUFFY: Let her speak for herself. That's what's done in polite circles.
BUFFY: (to the Primitive) Why do you follow me?
TARA: I don't.
BUFFY: Where are my friends?
TARA: You're asking the wrong questions.
BUFFY: (calm anger) Make her <u>speak</u>.
TARA: I have no speech. No name. I live in the action of death. The blood- cry, the penetrating wound. I am destruction. Absolute. Alone.
BUFFY: (realizing) The Slayer.
TARA: The first.
BUFFY: I'm not alone.
TARA: The slayer doesn't walk in the world.
BUFFY: I walk. I talk. I shop, I sneeze, I'm gonna be a fireman when the floods roll back. There's trees in the desert since you moved out, and I don't sleep on a bed of bones. Now <u>give me back my friends</u>.
PRIMITIVE: No… friends… just the kill… we are… <u>alone</u>.
BUFFY: That's it. I'm waking up.
BUFFY: It's over.
BUFFY: Are you quite finished?
BUFFY: You just have to get over the whole primal power thing. You're not the source of me.
BUFFY: Also, in terms of hair care, you really want to say 'what kind of impression am I making in the workplace?' 'Cause that particular look --
WILLOW: The first slayer… wow.
XANDER: Not big with the socialization.
WILLOW: Or the floss…
GILES: Somehow, our joining with Buffy and invoking the essence of the Slayer's power was an affront to the source of that power.
BUFFY: You know, you coulda brought that up before we did it.
GILES: I did! I said there could be dire consequences!
BUFFY: Yeah, but you say that about everything.
JOYCE: I'm guessing I missed some fun.
WILLOW: The spirit of the first Slayer tried to kill us in our dreams.
JOYCE: Oh. You want some hot chocolate?
ALL: Yes please -- that sounds nice -- thanks, yeah…
JOYCE: Xander?
XANDER: Yes? What, Joyce -- dyeh, Buffy's mom?
JOYCE: Will you be my kitchen buddy again? Help me carry?
XANDER: Yes. Sure. Buffy's mom.
GILES: You all right?
BUFFY: Yeah, I just… I think I might jump in the shower.
GILES: You do seem a bit…
BUFFY: Yeah. I guess… the first Slayer. I never really thought about… it was just intense. I guess you guys got a taste of that, huh?
XANDER: Yeah, from now on, you keep your slayer friends out of my dreams, is that clear?
WILLOW: She's not good for the sleeping.
BUFFY: Yeah, well at least you all didn't dream about that guy with the cheese…
