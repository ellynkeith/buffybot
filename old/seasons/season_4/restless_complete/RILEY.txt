It's just a debriefing. They're not gonna make me disappear, and they're not pinning anything on me. I got Graham and a lot of the guys testifying I'm the reason they're alive. I might actually get out of this with an honorable discharge.
Oh yeah. Having the inside scoop on the administration's own Bay of Mutated Pigs is definitely an advantage.
(to Buffy) I'll call you when it's over.
You guys have fun tonight. (to Joyce) It was nice meeting you.
Well you showed up late or you'd have a better part! I'm cowboy guy!
(aside, to Harmony) I was on time so I got to be cowboy guy.
Props.
Why hello, little lady. Can I hold those milk pails for you?

Oh, we're drawing up a plan for world domination. The key element? Coffee makers that <u>think</u>.

We'd better make a fort.
If that's the way you want it baby, I guess you're on your on your own.
