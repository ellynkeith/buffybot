Where you from, Harris?
Were you born there?
I walked by your guidance counselor's office one time, a bunch of you were sitting there, waiting to beâ€¦ shepherded, to be guided. You and the other problems, glassy-eyed, slack-jawed, I remember it smelled like dead flowers. Like decay, and it hit me, yes, that's what it is; the hope of our nation's future is a bunch of mulch.
Where are you heading?
Do you know why they sent you here?
Your time is running out.
Are you a soldier?
You're neither. You're a whipping boy, raised by mongrels, and set on a sacrificial stone.
