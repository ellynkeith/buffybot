Howdy Debbie.
Can't take the pressure. It's not the music that's hard, it's the marching.
Yeah. But - you know - good jazz is  improvisational. So we'd be marching off in all directions. Running into floats  and stuff. Scary. 
Pretty much full time.
Senior bio? I sort of aced that final.
I thought it was right. It said "nice  seeing you" - not - "take me now." Not that I have anything against a  "take me now" kiss, mind you. But it's not very school.
Oh. That would be the "nice seeing you kiss."
Nice seeing you. (then) Of course - it can be a fine line. The "nice to see you" kiss can easily morph into….
Really nice seeing you. And if you aren't careful, that becomes….
(to Giles) Just a thought? Poker. Not your game.
Jeff? He was - I know him.
Or there just happened to be another werewolf  roaming the woods.
(frustrated) Good in theory. Not very helpful for the potential nibbler.
You're having a slayer watch me? Good thing we're not over-reacting
Okay. You know that thing where you bail  in the middle of an upsetting conversation?  I need to do that. Kind of dramatic. But  sometimes it's a necessary guy thing.
Get away from the cage.
It's going to happen soon. Get away from me.
Everything okay?
You know how to do those?
So we're scared now. It's official.
No. I'd say scared is pretty much called for. It's cool.
You okay?
Fell down and hit your… eye.
Hey. If you want to talk-
Present.  (glances at Willow) Hey. I may be a cold blooded jelly  donut - but my timing's impeccable.
Okay.
Debbie.
Victim #1. Jeff? He was in Jazz  band with us. They used to horse around.
I don't think so. But he hid her music  comp book once.
Add this and stir. I ran into her just  now - sporting a nasty black eye.
Deb was in the hall a minute ago.
I'll - lock myself in the cage.
This is a really bad time, Pete.
I talked to her, yeah. But it was move-free.
About this cage? When the sun sets -
I'm serious. Something happens, which  you probably won't believe -
-or you might.
Time's up. Rules change.
Yeah. A freshman told me that Pete  had eight iced café mochas and lost it.
