(reading) …going back into the wombs of time. The rabbit could not turn-…
Xander - oh good….
(gives him a look) Some of us are. Anyway, it'll help you stay awake.  It's good and very wolfy. And it seems to sooth the savage beast. Except the stuff about…. (glances at Oz / low whisper) Rabbits.
He gets sort of…over excited. (baby sitter talk) Now. He's already had his two o'clock feeding.  After sunrise, if he forgets where his clothes are -  They're on top of the file cabinet in his cage. And I put that towel up for privacy.
It's not you I'm worried about. It's me. I'm still getting used to half a monty.
(enjoying his wiggins) Wouldn't you like to know. (moving on) Okay - he's more manageable tonight and on  night three. Tomorrow - the total full moon?  That's the real howler. Still, if there's trouble  - there won't be - but, you know, if…
Thanks again for doing this.  I wouldn't ask, but I have this test-
He's just being Oz.
Okay. You. Scott. School kiss.
But in the dark. Alone. A school  kiss is a whole 'nother deal. It's  statement-y. it says - hey, peers -  we're smooching!
Totally. That kind of kiss in school is all about showing off. The "haves" rubbing it in the faces of the "have-nots."
I'm not sure I completely understand. What was the first kind of kiss?
And - how does that go?
What's the deal, Giles?
Which student?
Wolf you. Not you, you.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
He did not!
Right, we can see if it's a werewolf kill or  not. But what about Oz?
And I want you to. Do the guy thing - but…
Oz….
What?
(hands him a baggie) Here. Hold this open.
I'm not sure. I mean, there are a lot of  incised wounds - but they could be from anything. 
Almost done. Let me just get a few stray  hairs off the body. They may be from the attacker….
(to Xander) Yeah. That's it.
I thought Faith was on duty.
Glazed or cake? It's fun to watch them  make them, you know. They have this  spritzy thing that plops the batter right-
I've been sitting in Mr. Donut since the  TV did that snowy thing. (then) But, how come you're wakey-girl? I mean,  this time it's not your boyfriend who may  be a cold-blooded-
-jelly donut.
(re: donuts) Anybody? They're yummy delicious.
It wasn't conclusive. I-
I should know more after tonight.  I'm doing hair and fiber tests.
(caught) Not - I…like to sound technical when I'm scared.  But I figure - wolf hair, hair found on the body.  See if they match. It's a test.
What? Oh - no - I didn't mean it that way-
Yes!
Sorry. I got a little… I mean,  it's horrible. Horrible.
But you're not! It's a "kill in the day"  monster! One-hundred percent for sure.
Okay. Pretend Debbie wanted Platt  dead. Maybe he fought back.
So it is him? But weren't Mr. Platt  and Jeff murdered by an animal?
Well, when are you going to? I  mean - if Pete kills you - it'll be  pretty much too late.
(wincing) Wrong question.
Of course you can. And we'll both  help you. Believe me - we understand. (then) But you have to choose. It's got to be  you over him.
(to Buffy/worried) I think we broke her.
No! Down!! Bad Oz!
Get off her!
Get the gun, get the gun,  get the gun!!
HURRY!
We have to get you a better cage.
It's all over school. What happened  with Debbie and Pete… Except for  the "Pete was a monster" part.
Well, we found Pete's lab diaries and  stuff. Mr. Science was pulling a  Jeckel/Hyde deal. He was afraid Debbie  would leave him - so he mixed this  potion to get super mas macho.
