The two o'clock. Buffy Summers.
We're not going to be friends.
You already have friends - I hope. A friend is a good thing. Likes you, agrees with you, tells you what you want to hear. What you do need is a trained, not-too-crazy professional who will always give you his  honest opinion. Which I offer you. (then) Have a seat.
(points to certificates on the wall) Those are my credentials. Look, Buffy. Any person - grown up, shrink, pope, any  person who claims to be totally sane is either  lying or not very bright. Everybody has problems. Everyone has demons. Right?
Excellent. So, the hope I bring you is that demons can be fought. People can change. You can change. It's all about finding your strength. Believing in yourself (then) Now. Your turn. Let's start with why you ran away.
Bore me.
All nice things. But still - you're bringing me in at the end of the movie.
Tell me more about this guy. The bad-ending guy.
He changed.
He got mean.
But you didn't stop loving him. (off her silence) You know - lots of people lose themselves in love. It's no shame. They write songs about it. (then) The hitch is - you can't stay lost. Sooner or later, you have to get back to yourself.
If you can't - love becomes your master. And you're just it's dog.
