Private Harris reporting for Oz watch.
Call of the Wild. Aren't we reading the  Cliff Notes to this for English?
Rabbits?
No worries. I can handle the Oz full monty. (quickly) I mean - not handle, handle -  like "hands to flesh" handle.
Oh, good- (alarmed) Half? You and Oz? Which half?
Sleepy time. Gotchya.
No big. You can count on me. I got my coffee,  magazines…Figured I'd read, run the stairs here…. I'm good.
I'm telling you, it's a waste of time. I was here all night - 
But it's not. Not wolf you - or you you. Okay? The room was secure. The cage was locked. The window's unbreakable and-
-open.
Hey. Not to freak. I rested my eyes now and then. That's all.
A little now. A little then. But I never heard Oz leave and he was here in the morning when I… when I - 
If you want to put it that way, Mr. Technical.
(to Cordy/stern) Oz does not eat people. It's more, werewolf  play. You know - I bat you around a little bit.  Like a cat toy. I have harmless wolf fun. Is it  Oz' fault that, you know, side effect, people get  cut to ribbons and maybe then he takes a little  nibble and I'm not helping am I?
We're doing crime, Cordy. You don't sneak up during crime!
I think both "scarred" and "life"  are moot for this fella, Cordy.
Yeah, Will. This guy is barf-worthy. Can't we be elsewhere? Is Oz cleared or what?
Do you want to go back to the car and wait?
Great. So we got everything we need?
(worried) Okay - little too much excitement for the Willster… (to Cordy) It doesn't look good for Oz, does it?
In your special place, Cor.  And that's why I adore you.
