(surprised) Buffy. Right. Very good.
Jealousy, clearly, is the tool that Iago  used to undo Othello. But what's his  motivation? What reason does Iago  give for destroying his superior officer?
Any other reason?
Uh... good, Nancy. Can't overlook that.
Iago makes a lot of references to  Othello's color, but he never specifically  cites race as a motive. Is there something  else at work here?
Buffy. Really. Very astute. I said  something quite like that in my  dissertation.
Yes, and doesn't that also explain  Othello's readiness to believe Iago?  Within seconds he turns on Desdemona,  belies that she's unfaithful. And we're  all like that; we all have little internal  Iagos telling us our husbands or our  girlfriends or whatever don't really  love us. We can never see what's in  their hearts. We doubt. We worry.
Most of us don't go to as extreme  measures as Othello, thank goodness...
