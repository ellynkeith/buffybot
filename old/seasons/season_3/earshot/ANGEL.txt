Sorry.
It's a dangerous time. You know,  with Faith...
I just want to make sure you're okay.  That you're safe.
I'm tracking you. (beat) Something's bothering you.
"An aspect of the demon."
By rumor. But that doesn't mean  anything. Sometimes demons  exaggerate their power.
Believe me, I won't let anything hurt  you if I can help it. And no matter what  happens, I'll be with you. I'll love you  even if you're covered with slime.
You can't get into my mind.
It's like the mirror. The thoughts  are there, but they create no  reflection in you. (then) You got your "aspect of the demon."
You don't have to play games with  me, Buffy. Ever.
So ask me.
What do you want to know about?  Faith? How I felt kissing her? Pretending  to have no soul? Watching you suffer?
I hated hurting you. It cut me deeper  than I've ever been cut. More than  I can stand.
Kissing her meant nothing. I don't want  a bad girl. I've done that before. I've  lived a long time, Buffy, and I'm past  that. I've been with dozens of girls like  her. More.
There's no comparison. In 243 years  I've loved exactly one person.
Next time, just ask.
And Buffy, be careful with this gift.  A lot of things that seem good and  strong and powerful... they can be  painful.
Exactly. I'm dying to get rid of that.
(intensely) I'm a funny guy.
I got it.
I'm going to help you.
Giles!
Buffy?
