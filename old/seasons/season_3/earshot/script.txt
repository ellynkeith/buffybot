BUFFY: You demons just can't resist a  run-and-stumble, can you?
BUFFY: Say "Uncle". Oops. No mouth.
WILLOW: Scabby Demon got away?
BUFFY: Scabby Demon number two got away.  Scabby Demon one, big check in the  "Slay" column.
WILLOW: I don't like this "no mouth" thing.  It's disquieting. (realizing) Unless they have them somewhere  else...
GILES: Good morning, girls. We've just been  researching the Mayor's upcoming  Ascension.
OZ: It's pretty riveting stuff.
BUFFY: What do we know?
XANDER: What <b>don't</b> we know?! Tell her, Giles.
GILES: Well, based on the supposed date,  Graduation Day, and the Mayor  being impervious to harm, I've  cross referenced...
XANDER: He's a cross referencing <b>fool</b>.
GILES: ...and I have eliminated several  possibilities. It is <u>not</u> the ritual flaying  of the demon Azorath, nor the... the- (off their looks) I don't know what's going to happen.
OZ: That was kind of an anticlimax.
BUFFY: So we don't know anything? The  whole thing with Angel and Faith  was for nothing?
GILES: No, no. If nothing else, Angel's  charade succeeded in bringing  Faith's treachery into the open. And  this information about the Ascension  will prove useful; I just have to put it  together.
WESLEY: Terribly sorry. I was detained. Official  Council business. Giles, you were  talking?
GILES: I was just filling Buffy in on my  progress regarding researching the  Ascension.
WESLEY: Oh? And what took up the rest  of the minute?
GILES: (very humble) Touche. My work is, after all,  <u>un</u>official, and my sources are limited.  I'm sure, however, with the resources  of the Council behind you, that you have  something to add. We're all ears.
WESLEY: Well, I... I am pleased to state with  certainty that the demon Azorath  will <u>not</u> be involved in-
WESLEY: I'm sure we'll find out more soon.
GILES: (scornful; to Wesley) The demon Azorath.
WILLOW: Have you talked to Angel lately?
BUFFY: Not really. Seeing him bad again,  even pretend bad... and with Faith...
WILLOW: He only smootched her for the  greater good.
BUFFY: I don't know... to the naked eye,  it looks like fun. Or maybe it wasn't,  maybe he was never tempted... I just  wish I could be sure.
WILLOW: As always, I advise you to ask.
BUFFY: Like he'd tell me.
STUDENT: Hogan! Great game, man!
HOGAN: Thanks!
PERCY: (to the student) Just wait till tonight.
XANDER: Hogan Martin. Thinks he's so hot.  Like we should all be awed by him  'cause he can put a ball in a net.
HOGAN: Hey, Xander.
XANDER: He said my name! He knows my  name!
PERCY: Willow, hey.
WILLOW: Hi.
PERCY: I can't make the study session after  school today. Can we do it fifth  period?
WILLOW: Okay. Did you do the reading?
PERCY: Most of it...
WILLOW: Percy...
PERCY: I'll finish it at lunch.
WILLOW: That's my little trooper.
HOGAN: I don't know what you're doing to him;  I actually heard him complete a sentence.  Had a clause and everything.
PERCY: You're gonna watch the game, right?
WILLOW: Wouldn't miss it.
XANDER: See ya, Hogan.
BUFFY: You're going to the game? I didn't think  you watched basketball.
WILLOW: I didn't either. But I've really been  getting into it, and now we're in the  championship and it's so exciting!  It's too bad you're patrolling 'cause  we're all going, Xander and Oz.  Everybody.
BUFFY: Right. Everybody who isn't currently  Buffy.
GILES: You touched one of the demons.
BUFFY: A "good touch," not a "bad touch."  Anyway, it's been itching like crazy.  No big. Just another problem for the  good people at Lubriderm, right?
GILES: These are the demons in question?
BUFFY: In the disgusting flesh.
GILES: Hmm.
BUFFY: What?
GILES: Oh, it says that they can infect a host --
BUFFY: Infect? Infect?... Infect?
GILES: Infect a host with "an aspect of the  demon." That's all it says. I say,  that's rather terse, isn't it?
BUFFY: I'm going to get an aspect of them?  Like, a part of them?
GILES: Of course, there are many other  explanations for your hand. A new  fabric softener can cause irritation.  But just in case, I'd advise you not  to try to track the one that got away.  Let's minimize your exposure.
BUFFY: A part of the demon. I hope it's not  the outside part.
CHEERLEADERS: H-O-G-A-N. IT'S HOGAN!  GO HOGAN!
BUFFY: Is it just me or is this really lame?
OZ: I don't know. Usually I enjoy lameness,  and this is leaving me cold.
WILLOW: Well, according to Freddy's latest  editorial the pep rally is a place for  "pseudo-prostitutes to provoke men  into a sexual frenzy, which, when  thwarted, results in pointless athletic  competition".
CHEERLEADERS: GET THE BALL AND STUFF IT!  STUFF IT!
XANDER: The downside being...
WILLOW: The school paper is edging towards  depressing lately. Have you guys  noticed that?
OZ: I don't know; I always go straight  to the obits.
WILLOW: Buffy? What are you doing?
BUFFY: Nothing. (then, an admission) Checking for horns.
WILLOW: Oh, Buffy. You know, I don't even  think Giles is right about you becoming  like a demon. He's totally burnt,  dealing with Faith and this  Ascension thing. Between you  and me, he's not doing his best work.
BUFFY: But what if he's right? I'm suddenly  gonna grow a demon part and I don't  even know which one. It could be scales,  or claws, or -- (off Willow's look) --what?
WILLOW: Was it a boy demon?
CHEERLEADERSS: T-O-M. IT'S TOM! GO TOM!
XANDER: They're really very good.
OZ: Well, their spelling's improved...
XANDER: You know, Oz, I look at all this  beauty. All these... healthy young  women and I wonder why I even  wasted my time with Cordelia.  Look at her, she's no better looking  than the rest of them.
OZ: None of them are really my--
XANDER: Oh my god. He's looking at her.
XANDER: He's got his filthy adult Pierce Brosnan-y  eyeballs all over my Cordy.
OZ: You're a complex man, aren't you?
BUFFY: I'm just... I'm really scared, Will.  There's something in me and I can't  stop it, I can't find it, and what if it  changes me, not just the way I look,  but... I could be something that's not  me anymore.
WILLOW: Yay! Whoo-hoo! (then) Sorry. They spelled Percy. I had to  show support. He's needy. But I heard  you. Really. And I understand. I would  be frightened too. But--
BUFFY: Let's keep it between us for now,  okay?
WILLOW: Okay.
XANDER: Man, I'm pumped for the game tonight.
WILLOW: It's gonna be fun. (off Buffy) If you like that sort of thing.
BUFFY: That's okay. Patrolling is fun too.
BUFFY: Well, I've still got a mouth.
ANGEL: Sorry.
BUFFY: It's okay. I didn't see you so I  should've known you were there.  What are you doing here?
ANGEL: It's a dangerous time. You know,  with Faith...
BUFFY: Yeah. Faith... She, well... Faith.  What can you say about her?
ANGEL: I just want to make sure you're okay.  That you're safe.
BUFFY: And the fact that you're right here.  Does that mean Faith's around? Are  you keeping me safe by tracking me  or by tracking her?
ANGEL: I'm tracking you. (beat) Something's bothering you.
BUFFY: Oh, lots of things.
BUFFY: The most recent is this demon. Two,  actually. Ooky-looking with extra ook.  Well, I kind of... got one of them on me,  and now I might get a big case of the  bumpies or a tail or something...
ANGEL: "An aspect of the demon."
BUFFY: You now the drill...
ANGEL: By rumor. But that doesn't mean  anything. Sometimes demons  exaggerate their power.
BUFFY: Demon-hype. Or maybe not. But, hey,  I spend all my time here in the dark  anyway. Not like I'd be at a game or  out with friends or something where  people'd see me and my new monster-part.
ANGEL: Believe me, I won't let anything hurt  you if I can help it. And no matter what  happens, I'll be with you. I'll love you  even if you're covered with slime.
BUFFY: I liked everything up until that.
WILLOW: Could you believe it? Right at the buzzer! Three points for the win!
OZ: It was intense.
XANDER: Yeah, for a minute there I thought  you were gonna make an expression.
OZ: I felt one coming on, I won't lie...
WILLOW: I've never seen anyone jump like  Hogan Martin. They should call him  "The Jumper."
XANDER: Or a name that isn't an article of  women's clothing.
WILLOW: Shush.
BUFFY: Ooh. Quietness. We either lost the  game or we won and you don't want  me to feel bad.
WILLOW: Yeah, well, it wasn't really a good  game.
XANDER: Yeah. Tall hoop, but then, tall guys,  so what's the point.
OZ: Pretty dull.
CORDELIA: Are you guys crazy? It was an incredible  game! I've never cheered so hard in my  life. I've still got knee-marks on my back. (off their looks) From the pyramid.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) Yeah, well. I still bet patrolling was  way better. Because, wow, important.
BUFFY: I thought I saw a four-legged demon.  But it was a dog.
OZ: (interested) A weredog?
BUFFY: Regular.
XANDER: Tough luck.
BUFFY: Yeah.
BUFFY: It really bugs you, huh?
XANDER: What?
BUFFY: Cordelia and Wesley. Smootching.
XANDER: Man. You read my mind.
BEACH: (pleasantly) Whoa there. You watch where you're  going now.
BUFFY: Sorry, Mr. Beach. I will.
BUFFY: Is this the thing? The aspect-thing?  Because, I've got to say, it's better than  a tail. I mean, it's hard enough getting  jeans that fit right anyway...
GILES: Buffy. Slow down. I'm not even  convinced that you're experiencing  genuine mind-reading. Most likely,  you're projecting...
BUFFY: When I came in, a minute ago, you  thought, "Look at those shoes. If the  fashion magazines told her to, she'd  wear cats strapped to her feet."
GILES: I... that...
BUFFY: And by the way, cat-shoes? I mean,  what is that?
GILES: Of course. The demons are telepathic.
BUFFY: I know. You just told me. That's why  they don't need mouths. And you  should have known.
GILES: I... this is astounding.
BUFFY: It was happening in the hall. Principal  Snyder has "Walk Like an Egyptian"  stuck in his head. And the boys in this  school are seriously disturbed. It was  strange, but, Giles, it's like this whole  secret world is open to me. Think what  I can do.
GILES: It would be useful. You can anticipate  an opponent's moves, turn their plans  against them...
BUFFY: Oh, way better than that.
BUFFY: Jealousy!
MURRAY: (surprised) Buffy. Right. Very good.
MURRAY: Jealousy, clearly, is the tool that Iago  used to undo Othello. But what's his  motivation? What reason does Iago  give for destroying his superior officer?
BUFFY: (working it out) Well, he was passed over for promotion,  Cassio was picked instead... and people  were saying Othello slept with his wife.
MURRAY: Any other reason?
NANCY: Race!
MURRAY: Uh... good, Nancy. Can't overlook that.
BUFFY: (whispered to Willow) Who's that guy?
WILLOW: Freddy Munson. He writes those  editorials for the school paper.  He's sardonic.
MURRAY: Iago makes a lot of references to  Othello's color, but he never specifically  cites race as a motive. Is there something  else at work here?
BUFFY: Well, he sort of admits himself that  his motives are... spurious, he just  does things because he enjoys them...  sort of... Well it's almost like he's not a  person, like he's a force of nature -  the dark half of Othello himself,  Othello's fear and rage sort of...  embodied...
NANCY: (raggedly overlapping) Whoa.
MURRAY: Buffy. Really. Very astute. I said  something quite like that in my  dissertation.
BUFFY: I know. I mean, I agree. With that.
MURRAY: Yes, and doesn't that also explain  Othello's readiness to believe Iago?  Within seconds he turns on Desdemona,  belies that she's unfaithful. And we're  all like that; we all have little internal  Iagos telling us our husbands or our  girlfriends or whatever don't really  love us. We can never see what's in  their hearts. We doubt. We worry.
MURRAY: Most of us don't go to as extreme  measures as Othello, thank goodness...
BUFFY: Hi. Sorry about the daytime. I just  ducked out of school and that's when  they have it.
BUFFY: You look good. I mean, I saw you  last night, but sometimes things change  real quick. I mean, really quickly.  Listen to me, I'm talking like Faith.
BUFFY: Not that she was so bad to have  around. Before the evil. I think she  was hurting a lot. Some people,  protective-type people, might be  drawn to that, I guess.
BUFFY: The thing about Faith...
ANGEL: You can't get into my mind.
BUFFY: How did you--? And why not?
ANGEL: It's like the mirror. The thoughts  are there, but they create no  reflection in you. (then) You got your "aspect of the demon."
BUFFY: Yeah. Giles doesn't know how  long it's going to last, but it's okay.  A little headachy, but...
ANGEL: You don't have to play games with  me, Buffy. Ever.
BUFFY: Well, you're not exactly Joe Here's  What I'm Thinking.
ANGEL: So ask me.
BUFFY: Oh. But that would make sense.
ANGEL: What do you want to know about?  Faith? How I felt kissing her? Pretending  to have no soul? Watching you suffer?
BUFFY: Well, since <u>you</u> want to talk about  those things...
ANGEL: I hated hurting you. It cut me deeper  than I've ever been cut. More than  I can stand.
BUFFY: Thank you. Um... and the Faith part  of the question? I mean, I guess I'd  understand... she's got this whole "bad  girl" thing going on...
ANGEL: Kissing her meant nothing. I don't want  a bad girl. I've done that before. I've  lived a long time, Buffy, and I'm past  that. I've been with dozens of girls like  her. More.
BUFFY: Oh, this honesty stuff is fun.
ANGEL: There's no comparison. In 243 years  I've loved exactly one person.
BUFFY: Oh. (beat) It's me, right?
ANGEL: Next time, just ask.
BUFFY: Okay.
ANGEL: And Buffy, be careful with this gift.  A lot of things that seem good and  strong and powerful... they can be  painful.
BUFFY: Like, say, immortality?
ANGEL: Exactly. I'm dying to get rid of that.
BUFFY: Funny.
ANGEL: (intensely) I'm a funny guy.
XANDER: She can read our mind? Our every  impulse and fantasy?
BUFFY: Every one.
CORDELIA: I don't see what this has to do with me.
WILLOW: Well, I think it's good. Right? I mean,  you enjoy your other Slayer powers.
BUFFY: Yeah! It'll be fun. Did you see Nancy  Doyle's face in English class?
BUFFY: No, I need you! I do.
CORDELIA: Okay, who are you talking to? Because  you are just so creepy right now.
GILES: Well, there must be some precedent  for this sort of occurrence. I'll start  researching it. Wesley, you'll give me  a hand?
WESLEY: Of course.
OZ: Huh.
BUFFY: Xander, is that <u>all</u> you think about?
XANDER: Actually...? Bye.
WESLEY: Xander has just illustrated something.  Chances are, you're all going to find  yourself thinking whatever you least want  Buffy to hear. It's a matter, of course,  of mental discipline...
WESLEY: Excuse me.
WILLOW: What's it like, Buffy?
BUFFY: Oh, Will, it's... weird. And <u>please</u>,  don't think I don't need you, because  I really want to share this. It's... like  all these doors opening into all these  little worlds and I can just walk in.
BUFFY: Willow... don't think that.
WILLOW: I can't help it!
WILLOW: I'm sorry, Buffy. I just can't...
OZ: If you don't need me, I'm gonna  follow the redhead.
BUFFY: Okay.
BUFFY: Well, I guess I won't write that book  "Win Friends Through Telepathy."
CORDELIA: Whatever. Can I go?
WESLEY: Can you hear me thinking in here? I  could go out in the hall.
BUFFY: (to Wesley) You know what? You stay. I'll go.  I'm getting a headache.
GILES: Here. It's happened before. A man in  Ecuador, quite recently.
WESLEY: Can we contact him?
GILES: I would say not. He can't communicate  with anyone.
WESLEY: Dead?
GILES: No. He's in complete isolation. The  power. He can't shut it off.
JONATHON: Are you through with the potatoes?
STUDENT: Hey!
GILES: Are you all right?
CORDELIA: I told them not to move you. They  probably severed your spinal cord.
BUFFY: I'm okay.
GILES: Buffy--
BUFFY: Really, I am. Listen. There's a killer  in the cafeteria.
XANDER: I've been saying for years that the lunch  lady's going to do us all in with that mulligan  stew. I mean, what the hell is a mulligan?
BUFFY: Someone was thinking it. "This time  tomorrow, I kill you all." I have to  find them.
GILES: You didn't recognize the voice?
BUFFY: No.
WILLOW: Boy or girl?
BUFFY: I don't know. It was so full of...  anger and pain, it was hardly human.
GILES: You can't.
BUFFY: I have to find them.
OZ: Are you sure they meant it?
XANDER: Yeah. I mean, who hasn't just idly  thought about taking out the whole  place with a semi-automatic? (off their looks) I said idly.
BUFFY: I know the difference. He, she,  whoever, <u>they meant it</u>. They're  going to do it.
BUFFY: Shut up!
BUFFY: I'm sorry. I just mean... stop thinking  so loud... or so much...
GILES: You have to go home, Buffy. I'll  take you home.
BUFFY: Yeah, okay. But, you guys, you have  to do this. Go back in there, make a list,  everyone in the cafeteria. We've got to  find the killer before lunch tomorrow!
WILLOW: We'll do it, Buffy. A list of all the  students.
BUFFY: Nancy was there. She's scary. Teachers  too. Mr. Beach thought something  about getting rid of us...
GILES: (to Buffy) Come on.
BUFFY: I can't shut it out, Giles. I mean, it's  like this... invasion of my head -  strangers walking around in there.  Look at this, I can't even be around  people. Not that they're clamoring  to be near me now anyway. Even you.
GILES: I'm sorry, Buffy. It's hard for all of  us. But Wesley and I are looking  for a way to help.
BUFFY: I'm going to be okay, aren't I? You  know, even if you can't get rid of it?
GILES: You'll be fine. I promise.
WILLOW: We have a list of the people in the  cafeteria. I'll do some computer work,  match it against the FBI mass-murderer  profiles. We can rule some people out.
XANDER: I'm still having trouble with the idea  that one of us is just gonna gun  everybody down for no reason.
CORDELIA: (sarcastically) Yeah, 'cause that never happens in  American high schools.
OZ: It's bordering on trendy at this point.
WILLOW: Besides which: Sunnydale high. Center  of Evil and all that. So let's get to work.  We have till lunch time tomorrow.  We hope.
JOYCE: There. You look better already.
BUFFY: Thanks Mom--
BUFFY: I don't really need --
BUFFY: Mom!
JOYCE: How about some soup? Chicken and stars?
BUFFY: Mom. Stop it. Come sit with me.
JOYCE: Well... I've got... laundry...
BUFFY: Why are you...
BUFFY: You had sex with Giles. You had  <u>sex</u> with <u>Giles</u>!
JOYCE: It was the candy! We were teenagers!
BUFFY: On the hood of a police car?!
JOYCE: I'll be downstairs! Feel better!
BUFFY: (called after) <u>Twice</u>?!
WILLOW: Okay. I've taken our list and narrowed  it to a dozen strong suspects.
WILLOW: These are your personalized  assignments.
XANDER: Oh, I was <u>hoping</u> there'd be assignments.
CORDELIA: I think I should work with Wesley.
XANDER: You have no shame.
CORDELIA: Oh, like shame is something to  be proud of.
WILLOW: Be quiet! Sorry, but this is important.  Talk to everyone on your list. Use  the sample questions. Today, people!
WILLOW: (called after) Oh! Write neatly and label your  worksheets!
WILLOW: Fantasies are fun, aren't they  Jonathan?
JONATHAN: I guess.
WILLOW: We all have fantasies where we're  powerful and respected. Where people  pay attention to us.
JONATHAN: Maybe.
WILLOW: But sometimes the fantasy isn't enough,  is it, Jonathan? Sometimes you have to  <u>make</u> it so people don't ignore you. <u>Make</u>  them pay attention. You know what I'm  talking about, don't you?
JONATHAN: You want me to pay attention?
HOGAN: This is for the yearbook?
OZ: (nodding) "Personality profiles".
HOGAN: Can you ask it again?
OZ: Do you ever feel that you've created a  false persona for yourself of the guy  who does everything right, and how  much of a strain does that put on you  to maintain it?
HOGAN: Huh. Wow. I guess... moderate strain?  Is that a good answer? I want to get  this right.
OZ: Uh-huh.
CORDELIA: Hi, Mr. Beach. I was just wondering  if you were planning on killing a bunch  of people tomorrow? Oh, it's for the  yearbook.
XANDER: Okay, so 'turn offs' include smoking,  insensitive men and Birkenstocks.  Now, your idea of the perfect romantic  evening...
WESLEY: Well, it seems to be coming along  all right.
GILES: Yes, Buffy's being driving mad, we  have no proof this will work and it  still requires the heart of the second  demon, which we have no idea how  to get without the slayer.
WESLEY: Negative thinking doesn't solve problems.
GILES: Berk.
NANCY: Do I often imagine classmates are  spying on me or otherwise acting  suspiciously?
WILLOW: Right.
NANCY: Not 'til just now.
OZ: Freddy? You there?
LARRY: What? Talk louder, dude.
XANDER: (discreetly) I'm just saying it's got to be frustrating.  Having this secret? You gotta be kind of  filling up with resentment, unexpressed  rage waiting to burst out. Today at lunch.
LARRY: (loudly) What secret? Being gay?
XANDER: Shhh!
LARRY: Man, I'm out. I'm so out I got my  grandma fixing me up with guys.
XANDER: Oh. That's... nice?
LARRY: But it sounds like <u>you're</u> having a  rough time with it.
XANDER: Again, may I suggest shhh?
LARRY: Look, just do it.
LARRY: (to Xander) Look there. That weird Freddy  Munson guy who does the school  paper?
XANDER: He's gay?
LARRY: No, dude, but I bet he'd put in, like,  a coming-out announcement for you.  Something tasteful.
JOYCE: I can't stand this. I keep wondering if  I'm hurting her, with my thoughts.
GILES: You're not. Not anymore. She can't  pick one thought out of the... din.
ANGEL: I got it.
WILLOW: He's the only one we couldn't find?
OZ: Yeah. Freddy Munson.
CORDELIA: The newspaper guy? But we can't  figure out it's him without the worksheet,  right?
XANDER: Uh... we do have this, people. Today's  editorial titled, "BIG GAME DRAWS  MINDLESS, BRAINDEAD MOB."
CORDELIA: Does he mention the cheerleaders?  Because we were <u>on</u>.
BUFFY: No. No!
ANGEL: I'm going to help you.
BUFFY: Who?
ANGEL: Giles!
JOYCE: Thank God.
ANGEL: Buffy?
BUFFY: Angel?
JOYCE: Are you all right? Do you hear thoughts?
BUFFY: (tries) No...  (looks to Giles) Did you find the killer?
FREDDY: Okay, Oz. You got me. What are your  friends going to do? Hold me down?
WILLOW: You better believe it, Buster. You can't  threaten a big murder without getting us  pretty darn ticked.
FREDDY: Murder? What murder? You're not  here about the review?
OZ: The review?
FREDDY: Last Thursday.
OZ: (reading) "'Dingoes Ate My Baby' play their  instruments as if they had plump Polish  sausages taped to their fingers..."
FREDDY: Sorry, man.
OZ: No. It's fair.
FREDDY: I get a lot of hate mail. I sorta figured  you were bringing yours personally.
XANDER: Hey, if you happen to find a tasteful  announcement about me from Larry --
WILLOW: Xander. We have to figure this out.
CORDELIA: Oh, we have no shot. The killer could  be anyone. We lose.
WILLOW: Buffy!
XANDER: You're okay! Can you hear thoughts?
BUFFY: No.
XANDER: And just when I wasn't thinking  about sex.
BUFFY: Okay. Here's the new plan. We try to  get Snyder to evacuate the school and  just hope our bad guy isn't waiting outside  with--
CORDELIA: (reading) "By this time tomorrow, you'll all know  what I've done."
CORDELIA: "...I'm sure you understand that I had  to do it, and that although death is never  easy, it is the only way."
CORDELIA: God, doesn't anyone write in to praise  the cheerleaders? We are so unsung.
WILLOW: Jonathan. Ooh. I had him in my grasps,  the slippery weasel.
BUFFY: Split up. Find him.
WILLOW: Jonathan? Are you in here?
XANDER: (urgently) Jonathan?
XANDER: Ooh. Jell-O.
NANCY: I could have done that.
JONATHAN: Get away from me!
BUFFY: Okay, Jonathan, you wanna point  that somewhere else?
JONATHAN: You better not try and stop me.
BUFFY: No. No stopping. I'm just here for the  view. Hey look, city hall.
JONATHAN: Go away.
BUFFY: Never gonna happen.
JONATHAN: You think I won't use this?
BUFFY: I don't know, Jonathan, I'm just --
JONATHAN: Stop doing that!
BUFFY: Doing what?
JONATHAN: Stop saying my name like we're friends.  We're not friends. You all think I'm an  idiot. A short idiot.
BUFFY: I don't.
BUFFY: I don't think about you much at all.  Most people here don't. Bugs you,  doesn't it? You've got all this pain,  all these feelings and nobody's  paying attention.
JONATHAN: You think I just want attention?
BUFFY: No, I think you're in the bell tower  with a high powered rifle because you  want to blend in. Believe it or not, Jonathan,  I understand. About the pain.
JONATHAN: Oh, right. 'Cause the burden of being  beautiful and athletic, that's a crippler.
BUFFY: I'm sorry, I was wrong. You are an idiot.
BUFFY: My life happens very occasionally to  suck beyond the telling of it. More than  I can stand sometimes. And not just me.  Every single person down there is  ignoring your pain because they're way  too busy with their own. The beautiful  ones, the popular ones, the guys that  pick on you... everyone.
BUFFY: If you could hear what they're feeling -  the confusion, the loneliness... It looks  quiet down there. It's not. It's deafening.
BUFFY: You know I could have taken the  gun by now.
JONATHAN: I know.
BUFFY: (holds out her hand) Rather do it this way.
JONATHAN: I just wanted it to stop.
BUFFY: Well, mass murder is not actually  doctor recommended for this kind  of pain. And by the way, prison? A  lot like high school, only instead  of noogies --
JONATHAN: What are you talking about?
BUFFY: Actions having consequences, stuff  like that --
JONATHAN: I wouldn't ever hurt anybody. I came up  here to kill <b>myself</b>.
XANDER: Rat poison! Rat poison!
XANDER: Drop your spoons! Step away from  the spoons!
BUFFY: Okay, let's calm down.
LADY: Vermin you're all vermin... you come  in and you eat and you eat! Filth!
BUFFY: I don't see this being settled with logic.
WILLOW: So you're feeling better about Angel.
BUFFY: Yeah. I mean, we talked, and he  ripped the heart out of a demon  and fed it to me, and later we talked  some more.
WILLOW: See, that's how it should work.
GILES: Good morning.
WILLOW: Hi, Giles. Oh, I should get to the  yearbook office. I'm going to give  them the murderer questionnaires.  They really are good reading.
GILES: How are you?
BUFFY: Lovin' the quiet. Nobody in here but me.
GILES: And Jonathan? How is he doing?
BUFFY: Pretty crappy. His parents are freaking,  he's suspended, and toting a piece to  school not exactly earning him a place  with the 'in' crowd. But I think he's dealing.
GILES: It's good of you to check up on him.
BUFFY: It's nice to be able to help someone in  a non-slaying capacity. But he's starting  to get that look, like he's gonna ask me  to the prom.
GILES: Well, you know, it would probably help  his self esteem if --
BUFFY: What am I, Saint Buffy? He's like three  feet tall.
GILES: Good to see you've emerged from  your psychic adventure more or less  intact. Feel up to some training?
BUFFY: Sure. We can work out after school.  You know, if you're not too busy  HAVING SEX WITH MY MOTHER!
