I guess.
Maybe.
You want me to pay attention?
Get away from me!
You better not try and stop me.
Go away.
You think I won't use this?
Stop doing that!
Stop saying my name like we're friends.  We're not friends. You all think I'm an  idiot. A short idiot.
You think I just want attention?
Oh, right. 'Cause the burden of being  beautiful and athletic, that's a crippler.
I know.
I just wanted it to stop.
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't ever hurt anybody. I came up  here to kill <b>myself</b>.
