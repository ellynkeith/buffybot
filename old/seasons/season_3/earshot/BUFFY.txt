You demons just can't resist a  run-and-stumble, can you?
Say "Uncle". Oops. No mouth.
Scabby Demon number two got away.  Scabby Demon one, big check in the  "Slay" column.
What do we know?
So we don't know anything? The  whole thing with Angel and Faith  was for nothing?
Not really. Seeing him bad again,  even pretend bad... and with Faith...
I don't know... to the naked eye,  it looks like fun. Or maybe it wasn't,  maybe he was never tempted... I just  wish I could be sure.
Like he'd tell me.
You're going to the game? I didn't think  you watched basketball.
Right. Everybody who isn't currently  Buffy.
A "good touch," not a "bad touch."  Anyway, it's been itching like crazy.  No big. Just another problem for the  good people at Lubriderm, right?
In the disgusting flesh.
What?
Infect? Infect?... Infect?
I'm going to get an aspect of them?  Like, a part of them?
A part of the demon. I hope it's not  the outside part.
Is it just me or is this really lame?
Nothing. (then, an admission) Checking for horns.
But what if he's right? I'm suddenly  gonna grow a demon part and I don't  even know which one. It could be scales,  or claws, or -- (off Willow's look) --what?
I'm just... I'm really scared, Will.  There's something in me and I can't  stop it, I can't find it, and what if it  changes me, not just the way I look,  but... I could be something that's not  me anymore.
Let's keep it between us for now,  okay?
That's okay. Patrolling is fun too.
Well, I've still got a mouth.
It's okay. I didn't see you so I  should've known you were there.  What are you doing here?
Yeah. Faith... She, well... Faith.  What can you say about her?
And the fact that you're right here.  Does that mean Faith's around? Are  you keeping me safe by tracking me  or by tracking her?
Oh, lots of things.
The most recent is this demon. Two,  actually. Ooky-looking with extra ook.  Well, I kind of... got one of them on me,  and now I might get a big case of the  bumpies or a tail or something...
You now the drill...
Demon-hype. Or maybe not. But, hey,  I spend all my time here in the dark  anyway. Not like I'd be at a game or  out with friends or something where  people'd see me and my new monster-part.
I liked everything up until that.
Ooh. Quietness. We either lost the  game or we won and you don't want  me to feel bad.
I thought I saw a four-legged demon.  But it was a dog.
Regular.
Yeah.
It really bugs you, huh?
Cordelia and Wesley. Smootching.
Sorry, Mr. Beach. I will.
Is this the thing? The aspect-thing?  Because, I've got to say, it's better than  a tail. I mean, it's hard enough getting  jeans that fit right anyway...
When I came in, a minute ago, you  thought, "Look at those shoes. If the  fashion magazines told her to, she'd  wear cats strapped to her feet."
And by the way, cat-shoes? I mean,  what is that?
I know. You just told me. That's why  they don't need mouths. And you  should have known.
It was happening in the hall. Principal  Snyder has "Walk Like an Egyptian"  stuck in his head. And the boys in this  school are seriously disturbed. It was  strange, but, Giles, it's like this whole  secret world is open to me. Think what  I can do.
Oh, way better than that.
Jealousy!
(working it out) Well, he was passed over for promotion,  Cassio was picked instead... and people  were saying Othello slept with his wife.
(whispered to Willow) Who's that guy?
Well, he sort of admits himself that  his motives are... spurious, he just  does things because he enjoys them...  sort of... Well it's almost like he's not a  person, like he's a force of nature -  the dark half of Othello himself,  Othello's fear and rage sort of...  embodied...
I know. I mean, I agree. With that.
Hi. Sorry about the daytime. I just  ducked out of school and that's when  they have it.
You look good. I mean, I saw you  last night, but sometimes things change  real quick. I mean, really quickly.  Listen to me, I'm talking like Faith.
Not that she was so bad to have  around. Before the evil. I think she  was hurting a lot. Some people,  protective-type people, might be  drawn to that, I guess.
The thing about Faith...
How did you--? And why not?
Yeah. Giles doesn't know how  long it's going to last, but it's okay.  A little headachy, but...
Well, you're not exactly Joe Here's  What I'm Thinking.
Oh. But that would make sense.
Well, since <u>you</u> want to talk about  those things...
Thank you. Um... and the Faith part  of the question? I mean, I guess I'd  understand... she's got this whole "bad  girl" thing going on...
Oh, this honesty stuff is fun.
Oh. (beat) It's me, right?
Okay.
Like, say, immortality?
Funny.
Every one.
Yeah! It'll be fun. Did you see Nancy  Doyle's face in English class?
No, I need you! I do.
Xander, is that <u>all</u> you think about?
Oh, Will, it's... weird. And <u>please</u>,  don't think I don't need you, because  I really want to share this. It's... like  all these doors opening into all these  little worlds and I can just walk in.
Willow... don't think that.
Okay.
Well, I guess I won't write that book  "Win Friends Through Telepathy."
(to Wesley) You know what? You stay. I'll go.  I'm getting a headache.
I'm okay.
Really, I am. Listen. There's a killer  in the cafeteria.
Someone was thinking it. "This time  tomorrow, I kill you all." I have to  find them.
No.
I don't know. It was so full of...  anger and pain, it was hardly human.
I have to find them.
I know the difference. He, she,  whoever, <u>they meant it</u>. They're  going to do it.
Shut up!
I'm sorry. I just mean... stop thinking  so loud... or so much...
Yeah, okay. But, you guys, you have  to do this. Go back in there, make a list,  everyone in the cafeteria. We've got to  find the killer before lunch tomorrow!
Nancy was there. She's scary. Teachers  too. Mr. Beach thought something  about getting rid of us...
I can't shut it out, Giles. I mean, it's  like this... invasion of my head -  strangers walking around in there.  Look at this, I can't even be around  people. Not that they're clamoring  to be near me now anyway. Even you.
I'm going to be okay, aren't I? You  know, even if you can't get rid of it?
Thanks Mom--
I don't really need --
Mom!
Mom. Stop it. Come sit with me.
Why are you...
You had sex with Giles. You had  <u>sex</u> with <u>Giles</u>!
On the hood of a police car?!
(called after) <u>Twice</u>?!
No. No!
Who?
Angel?
(tries) No...  (looks to Giles) Did you find the killer?
No.
Okay. Here's the new plan. We try to  get Snyder to evacuate the school and  just hope our bad guy isn't waiting outside  with--
Split up. Find him.
Okay, Jonathan, you wanna point  that somewhere else?
No. No stopping. I'm just here for the  view. Hey look, city hall.
Never gonna happen.
I don't know, Jonathan, I'm just --
Doing what?
I don't.
I don't think about you much at all.  Most people here don't. Bugs you,  doesn't it? You've got all this pain,  all these feelings and nobody's  paying attention.
No, I think you're in the bell tower  with a high powered rifle because you  want to blend in. Believe it or not, Jonathan,  I understand. About the pain.
I'm sorry, I was wrong. You are an idiot.
My life happens very occasionally to  suck beyond the telling of it. More than  I can stand sometimes. And not just me.  Every single person down there is  ignoring your pain because they're way  too busy with their own. The beautiful  ones, the popular ones, the guys that  pick on you... everyone.
If you could hear what they're feeling -  the confusion, the loneliness... It looks  quiet down there. It's not. It's deafening.
You know I could have taken the  gun by now.
(holds out her hand) Rather do it this way.
Well, mass murder is not actually  doctor recommended for this kind  of pain. And by the way, prison? A  lot like high school, only instead  of noogies --
Actions having consequences, stuff  like that --
Okay, let's calm down.
I don't see this being settled with logic.
Yeah. I mean, we talked, and he  ripped the heart out of a demon  and fed it to me, and later we talked  some more.
Lovin' the quiet. Nobody in here but me.
Pretty crappy. His parents are freaking,  he's suspended, and toting a piece to  school not exactly earning him a place  with the 'in' crowd. But I think he's dealing.
It's nice to be able to help someone in  a non-slaying capacity. But he's starting  to get that look, like he's gonna ask me  to the prom.
What am I, Saint Buffy? He's like three  feet tall.
Sure. We can work out after school.  You know, if you're not too busy  HAVING SEX WITH MY MOTHER!
