Ready to face the beast?
I'm not sure I like your attitude, Mr. Snyder. I spoke to the School Board and according to them --
I think what my daughter's trying to say is: nyah nyah nyah nyah.
So you're a slayer, too.
Isn't that interesting. Do you like it?
Just a sec, honey. (to Faith) Buffy never talks that way, why do you love it?
Right, right, that could get you hurt. Buffy can be awfully negative sometimes. (turns to Buffy) See, honey, you gotta fight that.
Faith, can I get you another soft drink?
I like this girl, Buffy.
Now, Buffy --
Does anybody else think Faith is creepy?
It's probably good you were an only child.
Well, there are some things I'd be happy to see you share. Like the Slaying. Two of you fighting is safer than one, right?
Unless -- you heard her, she loves the slaying, couldn't she take over for you?
But next year you'll be in college, I don't see why --
That means you... when did you die, you never told me you died!
I hate this, I hate your life.
I know you didn't choose this, I know it chose you... I've tried to march in the slayer-pride parade but... (weakly) I don't want you to die.
