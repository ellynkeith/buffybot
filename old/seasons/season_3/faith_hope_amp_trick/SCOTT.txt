(passing by) Hi Buffy.
You told me if I came after eight I could run into Buffy. (to Buffy) I'm a bad liar, it's not good for the soul -- or the skin: it makes me blotch.
Hi. Don't you love this song?
(beat) Would you like to...? (re: dance floor)
I'm just going to go stand by the dance floor. If you change your mind you can mosey on over. If not, you don't mosey. No harm, no foul.
Hi.
Sorry. My bad.
Excuse me.
At the Bronze? You're friends with Buffy, right?
Scott, nice to meet you.
(spots:) Buffy, Faith is telling me tall tales.
(thinking it's him) Oh. (to Faith) Nice talking to you.
Hi.
How are you?
I know, be somewhere else. Think of this as my last ditch effort, I realize one more will qualify as stalking. (beat) I've given a lot of thought, some might say too much thought, to how I might be a part of your life. It begins with conversation, we all know this. Maybe over a cup of coffee, maybe at the Buster Keaton festival -- playing on State Street all this weekend...
(success at last) Keaton is key.
(pulling out a small white box) I got you a little present, guy in a retro shop said it represents friendship -- that's something I'd very much like to have with you.
Okay, I get the message.
Hello.
Why?
I don't know, Buffy, I'm really gonna have to think this over.
Okay, thought it over. I'm in. When do you want to go?
Good.
