Diet soda. Medium. Thank you.
Sunnydale. Town's got quaint, and the people: he called me sir, don't you  miss that? Admittedly, not a haven for the brothers -- strictly the caucasian persuasion in the Dale -- but you gotta stand up and salute their death rate. I ran a statistical analysis and Hello Darkness -- Makes D.C. look like Mayberry. And nobody sayin' boo about it. We could fit right in here. Have some fun.
Kill the Slayer, I know. Still, big picture...
Right back at you.
(beat) And now I'm hungry.
Check it out. This town -- this very street -- wired for fiber optics. We jack in a T-3, 2500 megs per, we got the whole world at our fingertips. (waves away vamp with incense censer) Theo, allergies. (to Kakistos) What I'm sayin' is, we stay local -- where the humans are jumpin' and the cotton is high -- but we live global: you got a hankering for the blood of a fifteen year old Filipina? I'm on the net, she's here the next day, express air.
On that front, good news and bad -- rumor is this town already has a slayer, which makes two, I'm not sure how that happens --
Yes she is. I'm running a computer check on every hotel, rooming house and youth hostel in town.
Meanwhile, soon as the sun's down -- (re: vamps) -- we're out in force.
I believe this dance is mine.
But the beat goes on. Gimmie whatchya got.
Spirited girl. We don't do something, she just might kill him.
I don't think I have a problem with that. Incense, candles, missing the Bulls games 'cause he's too cheap to pop for cable -- who's had enough here?
