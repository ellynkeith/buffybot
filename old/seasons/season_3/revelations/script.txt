WILLOW: Oz! Hey. Have a seat. Except, we  don't have any seats.
CORDELIA: Can I just say, I liked this place before  it got popular?
XANDER: You can, you have, and you will in  our future, I'm sure.
OZ: No problem, I'll just scrunch.
CORDELIA: Xander - why are you giving me a  lap dance?
XANDER: What, I just like you.
WILLOW: (too fast) And that's very beautiful. I think it's  great when two people like two people  and want to be close to them instead  of anyone else.
XANDER: Hear, hear.
OZ: Yeah, well put. Um, can I snag a sip?
WILLOW: Sure.
WILLOW: Sure.
XANDER: You got it.
XANDER: (to crowd) Thank you, we're here through Saturday, enjoy the veal.
CORDELIA: Why are you guys so hyper?
WILLOW: Hey, speaking of people and things  they do that are not like usual, anyone  notice Buffy acting sort of different?
XANDER: Let's see… killing Zombies, torching  sewer monsters, freeing the enslaved  populace of a parallel dimension…  nope. She's pretty much the same  old Buffster.
WILLOW: I just mean, she's off by herself a lot  more. And she's kind of distracted.
CORDELIA: Think maybe she's got a new honey?
WILLOW: A boyfriend? Why wouldn't she tell us?
CORDELIA: Excuse me. When your last steady  kills half the class, and then your  rebound guy sends you a dump-o-gram?  It makes a girl shy.
XANDER: But we're the best of Buffy's bestest  buds. She'd tell us.
WILLOW: About your new boyfriend. Who we  made up. Unless we didn't.
BUFFY: This was a topic of discussion?
OZ: Raised, never discussed.
CORDELIA: So? Are you with somebody or not?
BUFFY: Well, I wouldn't use the word "dating,"  but I am… going out with somebody.  Tonight.
WILLOW: (excited) Really? Who?
FAITH: Yo, what's up. (to Buffy) Time to motorvate.
BUFFY: Really, we're just good friends.
BUFFY: Synchronized slaying.
FAITH: New Olympic category.
BUFFY: What do you think?
POST: (to Faith) You telegraph punches, (to Buffy) leave blind sides open and, for a  school night slaying, you both take  entirely too much time. Which one  of you is Faith?
FAITH: Depends. Who the hell are you?
POST: Gwendolyn Post. Mrs. Your new  watcher.
FAITH: I'm telling you, I don't need a new  watcher! No offense, lady, I just have  this problem with authority figures.  They end up kinda dead.
POST: Duly noted, and fortunately, it's not  up to you. (to Giles) Mr. Giles - where do you keep the  rest of your books?
GILES: I'm sorry, the… rest?
POST: Yes, the actual library. (beat) Oh. I see.
GILES: I assure you, Mrs. Post, this is the  finest occult reference collection…
POST: …this side of the Atlantic, I'm sure.  Do you have Hume's Paranormal  Encyclopedia? (Giles doesn't) The Labyrinth maps of Malta? (nope) I suppose you have Sir Robert  Kane's Twilight Compendium?
GILES: Yes, I, I do have that.
POST: (condescendingly  disdainful) Yes, of course you do. I've been sent  by the council for a very important  reason. Faith needs a watcher. I am  to act in that capacity, and report back.
FAITH: Excuse me, Mary Poppins, you're  not listening…
GILES: Now, Faith, if the council feels you  need closer observations, well of  course we'll all cooperate -
POST: (to Giles) The council wishes me to report  on the entire situation here.  Including you.
BUFFY: Ooh, academic probation's not so  funny today, is it Giles?
POST: The fact is, there is talk in the council  that you've become a bit too… American.
GILES: Me?
BUFFY: Him?
POST: Operations here seem somewhat  haphazard. Sloppy. Faith. Sit  up straight and pay attention.
POST: A demon named Lagos is coming  here, to the Hellmouth. Mr. Giles,  an illustration of Lagos, if you please.
POST: Perhaps later. Lagos seeks the  Glove of Myhnegon. No record of  this glove's full power exists. We do  know it is highly dangerous, and  cannot fall in the hands of a demon.  Lagos must be stopped.
GILES: What do you propose?
POST: (witheringly) If it's not too radical a suggestion, I  thought we might kill him. I suggest  two slayers at full strength for a  coordinated hunt. We believe the  glove to be buried in a tomb  somewhere, so Lagos will be headed  for the cemetery.
GILES: Well, there is more than one in Sunnydale.
POST: I see. How many?
GILES: Twelve. Within city limits.
POST: Ah. Well, we shall have to take them  one at a time. Anything in your books  that might pinpoint the exact location  of the tomb would be useful but then,  we cannot ask for miracles. We'll  begin tomorrow at sunset. Faith!  With me, please.
GILES: Well. That was bracing.
BUFFY: She's an interesting lady. Can we  kill her?
GILES: I think the council would tend to frown  on that. Well. What do you say to  some training?
ANGEL: Buffy.
BUFFY: Angel…
BUFFY: I gotta go. Big night for us slayer-types.  People to see, demons to kill, you know  the drill. Better hurry before somebody  figures out what we're doing.
ANGEL: What are we doing?
BUFFY: Training. And almost kissing. I'm  sorry. It's just… old habit. Bad habit.  Habit to be broken.
ANGEL: It's hard.
BUFFY: It's not that hard. Cold turkey. That's  the key to quitting.
BUFFY: Do you think they have a patch for this?
ANGEL: You have to go.
BUFFY: I really do.
BUFFY: I'm gonna vent a little hormonal angst  by going out there and killing a  Lagos, whatever that is.
ANGEL: Lagos?
BUFFY: Yeah, he's some kind of Demon looking  for an all-powerful thingimibob and  I've got to stop him before unholy  havoc's unleashed and it's another  Tuesday night in Sunnydale.
ANGEL: Be careful.
GILES: There's not a word here about Lagos  or the Glove. We don't have time  for this near-missing. Find all you  can about the demon: His strengths,  weaknesses, place of origin, and  most importantly, how he plans to  use that glove.
XANDER: Hey, you're not the Watcher of me.
GILES: Then go home. But if you choose to  stay, work.
WILLOW: Ugh. It's late, I'm tired… what does  he want from us, anyway?
XANDER: The number of a qualified surgeon who  can remove the British flag up his butt.
WILLOW: My eyes are so blurry, everything  looks like a Fred Astaire movie.
WILLOW: Mmm.
WILLOW: Stop.
XANDER: Right. Stop means no and no means  no, so, stop.
GILES: Willow. Xander. You may stop your…  studying, I have what I need.
XANDER: (changing subject) W-What've you got?
GILES: A likely location of the Glove of  Myhnegon. Housed here, in the Von  Hauptman family crypt.
XANDER: The big one in the Restfield cemetery.  I know it well.
WILLOW: That's great, Giles. How'd you find it?
GILES: (icy) I looked.
XANDER: Where's Buffy at?
GILES: I'm not sure.
XANDER: Well I could stake out this crypt, give  her a heads up if she shows…
GILES: Yes, by all means go.
WILLOW: I can keep studying. I think we're right  on the verge of a real Lagos breakthrough.
GILES: No, I think we're done.
FAITH: Ronnie. Deadbeat. Steve. Klepto.  Kenny. DRUMMER. Eventually I  had to face up to my destiny as a loser  magnet. Now it's strictly get some  and get gone. You can't trust guys.
BUFFY: You can trust some guys. Really.  I've read about them.
FAITH: So. What about you?
BUFFY: Like, me and boys me? Not much to  tell, these days.
FAITH: Yeah, but you've gotta have stories.  I mean, I had my share of losers, but  you boinked the undead. So? What  was it like?
BUFFY: Life with Angel's complicated. Was.  It's… a little hard to talk about.
FAITH: Try.
BUFFY: All the Angel issues, they're still kind  of with me, so… you know?
FAITH: Sure, whatever. You know what?  We're 0 for 6 tonight. Let's blow  this off.
BUFFY: I am kind of beat… but Shady Hill  is pretty close.
FAITH: I'll swing through it, it's on my way  anyway.
BUFFY: Alone? I don't want -
FAITH: I got Miss Priss on my back now, I  don't need another baby sitter. I'll  holler if I'm having any fun.
BUFFY: Okay…
FAITH: Later.
FAITH: Son of a bitch… My lucky night.
XANDER: Hey Giles - here's a nifty idea. Why  don't I alleviate my guilt by going out  and getting myself really, really killed?
BUFFY: Oh, God…
ANGEL: Buffy…
BUFFY: What am I doing? What are YOU doing?
ANGEL: I don't know…
BUFFY: Shame on you! Oh, God. I… I don't  even know why I came back here.
ANGEL: It's good you did.
ANGEL: I think I have what you're looking for.
BUFFY: Great. Just, wherever this was  giftwrapped? Remind me not to shop  there.
ANGEL: The Glove of Myhnegon.
BUFFY: The world's ugliest fashion  accessory.
ANGEL: Don't. Once it's put on, the glove can  never be removed.
BUFFY: So, no touching. Kind of like us.
BUFFY: Sorry. Cheap shot, I know. (sighs) But at least the glove's safe. You hold  onto it, I'll tell Giles in the morning. (a yearning beat) At least <b>he'll</b> be happy.
GILES: There! The wood engraving, see?  The Glove of Myhnegon.
POST: Yes, engraved by Father Theodore  of Wolsham, based I believe on  very sketchy and unreliable folk  legends. The pictures are fun to  look at, Mr. Giles, but one ought  to read the nice words as well.
GILES: Ah, yes… Well. (at a loss) Some tea, perhaps?
POST: I know you must find me tiresome -  but it's insidious, really. A person  slips up on the little things…
POST: And soon everything's gone to hell  in a handbasket.
POST: For example, Buffy, your slayer -
GILES: (offended) Is nowhere near either hell <u>or</u>  a handbasket, thank you.
POST: Not yet. But the signs are daunting.  Finding the Glove of Myhnegon is  of the utmost urgency. Yet - Buffy's  attitude toward it is most casual. And  your ability to influence her seems - negligible. (then) I can see why the council of watchers  is concerned.
GILES: (fuming now) Mrs. Post. I assure you - Buffy is both  dedicated and industrious. And I am  in <u>complete</u> <u>control</u> of my slayer -
XANDER: Giles. We have a big problem.  It's Buffy.
POST: Would you like some assistance?
GILES: (smiles through gritted teeth) Thank you, that won't be necessary.
BUFFY: Hey, enough with the tragedy masks.  Lagos is outta luck - I found the magic  mitten thingy!
GILES: You'd better have a seat, Buffy.
BUFFY: What? Is somebody hurt?
XANDER: (cool) Not yet. But it's only a matter of time.
GILES: We know Angel is alive, Buffy. Xander  saw you with him.
GILES: It appears that you've been hiding him.  And that you lied to us -
WILLOW: (cutting him off) Nobody's here to blame you, Buffy.  We all do things we're not proud of -  but this is serious. You need help.
BUFFY: It's… It's not what you think.
XANDER: Hope not - because I <u>think</u> you're  harboring a vicious killer -
WILLOW: (to Xander/hard) Hey. This isn't about attacking Buffy.  Remember - "I" statements only?  "I feel angry." "I feel worried…"
CORDELIA: Fine. Here's one. I feel worried -  about me! Last time around, Angel  barely laid a hand on Buffy - he  was way more interested in  killing her <u>friends</u> - 
BUFFY: But he's better now. Willow cured  him and - somehow - he came back.
XANDER: Better for how long, Buffy? Have  you even thought about that?
BUFFY: What is this? Demons Anonymous?  I mean, I don't need an intervention  here -
GILES: Don't you? To hide this - to take into  your own hands…
BUFFY: I was going to tell you! But I didn't  know why he was back or anything.  I wanted to wait -
XANDER: For what? For Angel to go psycho  again the next time you give him a  happy?
BUFFY: I'm not going to - We're not together  like that!
OZ: But you were kissing him.
BUFFY: You were spying on me? What gives  you the right?
CORDELIA: What gives you the right to suck face  with your demon lover again?
BUFFY: It - it was an accident!
XANDER: What? You tripped and fell on his lips?
BUFFY: It was wrong. It can't happen again.  But I - I'd never put you guys in danger.  If I thought Angel was going to hurt anyone -
XANDER: You'd stop him. Like you did last time  with Ms. Calendar.
WILLOW: Buffy - when it comes to Angel -  you can't see straight. That's why  we're all going to help you face this.
BUFFY: But - he's good again. I swear. He  even found the Glove of Myhnegon  for us. It's at the mansion.
XANDER: Right. Good plan. Leave tons of  firepower with the scary guy. (to Buffy/pointed) And leave us to clean up the mess.
BUFFY: You'd love an excuse to hurt him,  wouldn't you?
XANDER: I don't need an "excuse." I think  "lots of dead people" actually constitutes  a <b>reason</b>.
BUFFY: Right, this is all nobility, you're not  jealous or anything -
CORDELIA: Hello? Miss not-over-yourself-yet?
BUFFY: Don't start with me -
WILLOW: Giles, no one's doing the "I" statements!
GILES: (standing) That's enough! Everybody. Buffy's  heard our concerns. And her actions,  while ill-advised, were understandable…  and the question of Angel… It can't  be solved while tempers run this hot.
GILES: Our priority right now is retrieving the  Glove of Myhnegon from the mansion  and finding a way to destroy it. Now -  all of you - back to your classes.
BUFFY: Thanks for the bail. I know this is a  lot to absorb, but Angel did find the  glove. That's good, right? Angel did  a good…
GILES: Be quiet.
GILES: I won't remind you that the fate of  the world often rests with the Slayer.  What would be the point? Nor shall  I remind you that you have jeopardized  the lives of everyone you know by  housing a known murderer. But sadly  I must remind you that <u>Angel tortured me</u>.  For hours. For pleasure. You should  have told me he was alive. You didn't.  You have no respect for me, or the job  I perform.
BUFFY: Giles…
FAITH: It's open.
POST: A word of advice? Vampires rarely  knock. Especially in daylight.
POST: So… this is your home.
FAITH: Yeah. The decorator just left. Cost  me a pretty penny - but a motif like  this don't come cheap.
POST: Faith. Do you know who the  Spartans were?
FAITH: Wild stab. Buncha guys from Spart?
POST: They were the fiercest warriors known  to ancient Greece. And they lived in  quarters very much like these. You  know why?
POST: Because a true fighter needs nothing else.
POST: I'm going to be very hard on you,  Faith. I will not brook insolence, or  laziness. I won't allow blunders like  last night's attack. You will probably  hate me a great deal of the time.
FAITH: Ya think?
POST: But I will make you a better slayer,  and that will keep you alive. You  have to trust that I'm right. God  only knows what Mr. Giles has  been filling your head with.
FAITH: Giles is okay.
POST: His methods are unfathomable to  me. I find him entirely confounding… (catches herself in reverie) But that's not important. Let him  have his games and secret meetings -
FAITH: What meeting?
POST: I don't know. Something between  Buffy and her friends.
FAITH: I guess that doesn't include me.
POST: And why does he let her socialize  so much, it hardly seems… No  matter. Do you feel like doing  some training?
FAITH: Training, as in punching and kicking  and stabbing?
POST: That's the idea.
FAITH: I'm your girl.
BUFFY: Hey.
WILLOW: Hey!
BUFFY: So, on a scale of one to a million, how  much are you hating me right now?
WILLOW: Zero. Negative digits. Not even peeved.
BUFFY: Okay. Mother Theresa? Could you  stop possessing the body of Willow  now. I need to talk to Willow.
WILLOW: It's me. I just think, you were scared,  you kept a secret. That's okay. Secrets  aren't bad. They're normal. Better  than normal. Secrets are good! Must  be a reason we keep them, right?
BUFFY: (a little confused) I guess…
WILLOW: So, you going to the Bronze tonight?  Or are you slipping away for a  not-so-secret rendezvous with Angel?
BUFFY: None of the above. I want to kill this  Lagos guy. Peace offering to Giles.
WILLOW: Well, Angel has the glove now, right?
BUFFY: Yeah. But Lagos doesn't know that.  Sooner or later he's bound to turn up  at that crypt looking for it.
WILLOW: And instead he finds Buffy in a bad mood.
BUFFY: We are the great strategists of our day.
FAITH: You look pissed.
XANDER: Rough day.
FAITH: Tell me about it.
XANDER: Rather just shoot.
FAITH: Don't think I don't know what you and  your pals were talking about behind my  back today.
XANDER: Yeah? And what was that?
FAITH: More about this glove deal than  you're saying.
XANDER: The Glove of Myhnegon? Right.  How'd you like a hit of some real news: (beat) Angel's still alive.
FAITH: The vampire.
XANDER: Back in town. Saw him myself. Toting  the famous and popular glove.
FAITH: Angel. Guy like that, with that kind of  glove… could kill a whole mess of people.
XANDER: Said the same thing to Buffy myself.  Weird how she didn't seem to care.
FAITH: Buffy knew he was alive. I can't  believe her.
XANDER: She says he's clean.
FAITH: And I say we can't afford to find out.  I say I deal with this problem right now.  I say I slay.
XANDER: Can I come?
POST: You wanted to see me,  Mr. Giles?
GILES: Yes. I'm sorry about asking you here  at this hour.
POST: Please. A good watcher is awake and  alert at all hours.
GILES: (sensing tiredness) Would you like some tea?
POST: (dropping the stiff act) God, yes, please. I'm completely  fagged out.
POST: I spent the afternoon training with  Faith. She doesn't lack for energy.
GILES: She's your first slayer, I take it?
POST: If you're questioning my qualifications -
GILES: (softly) I'm not. I have complete respect  for your methods, in my own,  American way.
GILES: I also have the glove. (off her look) It's not on me, but I believe it's safe  for now. There's a mansion on  Crawford Street, a… friend of  Buffy's is keeping it there.
POST: We have to get to it. Immediately.  Hide it before someone else finds it.
GILES: Or better still. Destroy it.
POST: Destroy it?
GILES: I know. I didn't realize it could  be done either. It requires transforming  fire into Living Flame and burning  the glove… It's complex, but I believe  I have all the necessary materials. We  can drive over there now and be done  with it.
POST: (overwhelmed) I must say, Mr. Giles - good show.
POST: Good show indeed.
WILLOW: Um, not to downplay my own slaying  abilities, which in some circles are  considered formidable, but… shouldn't  Faith be here?
BUFFY: (shrugs) Tried calling, no one home. But if  you're feeling any Demon-o-phobia,  please. Splitting's totally an option.  You're not the one in trouble with Giles.
WILLOW: (not true) That's true.
BUFFY: How long you think he can stay mad,  anyway?
WILLOW: The emotional Marathon Man?
BUFFY: Guess I can't really blame him. But  you know - it's weird. Now that my  secret is out with Angel, I feel… better.
WILLOW: Well sure you do. You've just had this  big burden lifted. Keeping secrets is  a lot of work. (beat) One could hypothetically imagine.
BUFFY: You have no idea.
WILLOW: None whatsoever! But, can I ask you  something? When you were with Angel,  and nobody knew about it, did that make  things feel, you know… sexier, somehow?
BUFFY: Like, the forbidden fruit's sweeter  kind of deal? Not really. Too much  pressure. After awhile, it even makes  the fun parts… not so fun.
WILLOW: Huh.
BUFFY: What makes you think all the secret  stuff is sexy, anyway?
WILLOW: No reason. Just wondering. Gotta keep  asking the big ol' questions when you're  blessed with this girl's thirst for  knowledge and okay I admit it there's  something I have to tell you.
BUFFY: What?
WILLOW: Okay. This'll make me feel better, right? (big breath) I've always thought of myself as a good  person. Floss, do my homework, never  cheat. But lately, and please don't  judge me, but… I just want you to be  the first to know that, that… there's  a demon behind you.
BUFFY: We'll pick up in a minute.
BUFFY: Okay. A plan "B" would be nice.
BUFFY: Now we're talking.
BUFFY: So what were you going to tell me?
WILLOW: Oh. I, um, opened my S.A.T. test  booklet five minutes early. Doesn't  seem that important now, does it?
BUFFY: My lips are sealed. Come on.
BUFFY: Let's go bring Giles some happiness.
XANDER: Good old Sunnydale Library. Comes  fully equipped with reference books,  file cards…
XANDER: …and weapons.
FAITH: Beauty.
XANDER: I call crossbow.
FAITH: You got it.
XANDER: All right. Ready to go?
FAITH: That I am.
XANDER: Wait.
FAITH: What?
XANDER: Oh my God. Giles!
XANDER: Giles - can you hear me? What happened?
FAITH: Gee, let me guess.
XANDER: (dialing 911) Hold it - stop - think a minute.
FAITH: Yeah, I'm thinking. Thinking Buffy's  ex-meat did this.
XANDER: This isn't Angel's style.
FAITH: The guy's a demon! How much more  proof do you need?
XANDER: Bite marks would be nice… (into phone) I have a medical emergency.  Sunnydale High.
FAITH: Screw this waiting crap.
XANDER: Faith - we don't help, Giles could die!
FAITH: Yeah - and he's gonna have a whole  lot of company, unless I do something  permanent.
XANDER: Wait!
FAITH: For what? You to grow a pair? You  handle the baby-sit. I'm going to  kill Angel.
XANDER: Damn it!
ANGEL: (in Latin) Exorere, Flamma Vitae. Prodi  ex loco tuo elementorum, in  hunc mundum vivorum.
ANGEL: (English Translation) Arise, Flame of Life. Come  forth from your place of the  elements, into this world of  the living.
BUFFY: Giles HAS to be psyched that we  showed up stuffy old Mrs. Post -
BUFFY: Oh, God.
PARAMEDIC: Sunnydale Medical we've got a  Caucasian male, mid-forties,  blunt object head trauma. Prep  E.R., we're bringing him in. (to group) Lifting.
BUFFY: What happened?
PARAMEDIC: No time for this.
GILES: Wait!
GILES: The Glove… of Myhnegon.  Must destroy…
PARAMEDIC: (to Buffy) You want him to live? Get out  of the way.
GILES: (to Buffy) Use… Living Flame.
PARAMEDIC: Move!
BUFFY: What happened?
XANDER: Your boyfriend's not as "cured"  as you thought.
BUFFY: What makes you think Angel did this?
XANDER: We saw what you saw.
BUFFY: So you just assume…
XANDER: I didn't. Faith did.
BUFFY: What did you tell her?
XANDER: Only what everyone knows. She's a  big girl. Came to her own conclusions.
BUFFY: How much of a head start's she got?
XANDER: Ten minutes.
BUFFY: Why's she doing this?
XANDER: Because she's a Vampire Slayer.
BUFFY: She's not killing Angel. (to Willow) Check Giles' research, find a way to  destroy the glove. I'm going to stop Faith.
WILLOW: Shut up and help me.
ANGEL: What do you want?
POST: Gwen Post. Mr. Giles sent me.
ANGEL: What for?
POST: To help you destroy the glove. Is that  the Living Flame?
ANGEL: Yes.
POST: Look, I'm sorry to be abrupt but  Lagos is on his way here now.  If you're doing the ritual incorrectly  it will only make the glove more  powerful.
ANGEL: All right. I dug up some Cadlinroot,  get ready to throw it in.
POST: Good. Where's the glove?
ANGEL: In the trunk.
POST: That's what I love about this town.  Everyone is so helpful.
POST: Oh, bugger.
ANGEL: That hurt.
POST: It was supposed to kill you. If you'd  been human, it would have. But…
POST: I believe this is your poison.
FAITH: Mrs. Post…?
FAITH: I can't believe how much I'm gonna  kill you.
ANGEL: You're not getting that glove.
FAITH: Wanna bet?
FAITH: What…?
XANDER: (in Latin) "…deinde addends dimidium  laterem ungularum bisulcarum  contusarum…"
XANDER: (English translation) "…adding then half the ingot  of ground, cloven hooves…" (stops) And that's all she wrote.  Think we got it?
WILLOW: It's either the catalyst for Living  Flame, or just some really smelly  sand. We have to test it.
XANDER: Let me double-check…
WILLOW: What.
XANDER: I know what the glove does.
WILLOW: There's no time to test this.
FAITH: Never stop a slayer when the blood is up.
BUFFY: Can't let you do it, Faith.
FAITH: You're confused, Twinkie. Let me  clear you up: (pointing) Vampire. Slayer. Dead vampire.
BUFFY: Faith, there's a lot you don't understand.
POST: Faith…
POST: She doesn't… know… She's blinded  by love…
BUFFY: Faith, no…
POST: Faith… trust me…
BUFFY: We can figure this out -
POST: The glove…
XANDER: We'll get it.
POST: (to Xander) Help Faith…
XANDER: What are you - stop! Guys, listen!
POST: Finally!
POST: (in Gaelic) Tar chugam a chumhacht Myhnegon!
POST: (English translation) Come to me, power of Myhnegon!
FAITH: What's going on?
POST: Faith, a word of advice. You're an idiot.
POST: (in Gaelic) Tar frim!
POST: (English translation) Come through me!
POST: (in Gaelic) Tar frim!
POST: (English translation) Come through me!
BUFFY: Can you draw her fire?
FAITH: That I can.
BUFFY: Then do it.
POST: (in Gaelic) Tar frim!
POST: (English translation) Come through me!
POST: There's nothing you can do to  me now. I have the Glove, and  with the glove comes the power!
BUFFY: I'm getting that.
POST: (in Gaelic) Tar frim!
POST: (English translation) Come through me!
CORDELIA: So there's no more glove thingy?
XANDER: A little Living Flame, a little mesquite…  gone for good.
OZ: Sounds like we missed a lot of fun.
XANDER: Then we're telling it wrong.
WILLOW: What do you think Buffy and Angel  are gonna do?
XANDER: Boy do I don't know.
WILLOW: He saved me from a horrible flamey  death. That sort of makes me like  him again.
XANDER: Well, as long as he and Buffy don't  get pelvic, we'll be okay. I guess.
BUFFY: What are you guys talking about?
OZ: Oddly enough, your boyfriend. Again.
BUFFY: He's not my boyfriend. Really and  truly. He's… I don't know.
BUFFY: Are we okay?
XANDER: Yeah. Seeing you kissing him, after  everything that happened… leaned  me toward the postal. But I trust you.
CORDELIA: I don't. Just for the record.
BUFFY: Let me guess. Gwendolyn Post,  not a watcher.
GILES: She was kicked out by the council  two years ago for misuses of dark  power. They swear there was a  memo…
BUFFY: I'd better go. Little more damage  control.
WILLOW: The whole Angel thing is so weird.
GILES: Yes, well, we'll have to let that one  unfold, won't we?
CORDELIA: Okay but when there's a big massacre  who gets the I-told-you-so?
XANDER: You get the I-told-you-so.
CORDELIA: Just so we're clear…
FAITH: Come in.
BUFFY: Place looks nice.
FAITH: Yeah, real Spartan.
BUFFY: How are you doing?
FAITH: Five by five.
BUFFY: I'm interpreting that as good…
BUFFY: Mrs. Post, or whoever she was, she  fooled us all. Even Giles.
FAITH: Yeah, well, you can't trust people.  I shoulda learned that by now.
BUFFY: This may sound funny coming from  someone who just spent a lot of time  kicking your face, but you can trust <b>me</b>.
FAITH: Is that right?
BUFFY: I know I've kept secrets, but I didn't  have a choice. I'm on your side.
FAITH: <b>I'm</b> on my side. And that's enough.
BUFFY: Not always.
FAITH: So, is that it?
BUFFY: I guess…
FAITH: I'll see you, then.
BUFFY: Yeah.
FAITH: Buffy?
BUFFY: (stops) Yes?
FAITH: Nothing.
