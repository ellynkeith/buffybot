Oz! Hey. Have a seat. Except, we  don't have any seats.
(too fast) And that's very beautiful. I think it's  great when two people like two people  and want to be close to them instead  of anyone else.
Sure.
Sure.
Hey, speaking of people and things  they do that are not like usual, anyone  notice Buffy acting sort of different?
I just mean, she's off by herself a lot  more. And she's kind of distracted.
A boyfriend? Why wouldn't she tell us?
About your new boyfriend. Who we  made up. Unless we didn't.
(excited) Really? Who?
Ugh. It's late, I'm tired… what does  he want from us, anyway?
My eyes are so blurry, everything  looks like a Fred Astaire movie.
Mmm.
Stop.
That's great, Giles. How'd you find it?
I can keep studying. I think we're right  on the verge of a real Lagos breakthrough.
(cutting him off) Nobody's here to blame you, Buffy.  We all do things we're not proud of -  but this is serious. You need help.
(to Xander/hard) Hey. This isn't about attacking Buffy.  Remember - "I" statements only?  "I feel angry." "I feel worried…"
Buffy - when it comes to Angel -  you can't see straight. That's why  we're all going to help you face this.
Giles, no one's doing the "I" statements!
Hey!
Zero. Negative digits. Not even peeved.
It's me. I just think, you were scared,  you kept a secret. That's okay. Secrets  aren't bad. They're normal. Better  than normal. Secrets are good! Must  be a reason we keep them, right?
So, you going to the Bronze tonight?  Or are you slipping away for a  not-so-secret rendezvous with Angel?
Well, Angel has the glove now, right?
And instead he finds Buffy in a bad mood.
Um, not to downplay my own slaying  abilities, which in some circles are  considered formidable, but… shouldn't  Faith be here?
(not true) That's true.
The emotional Marathon Man?
Well sure you do. You've just had this  big burden lifted. Keeping secrets is  a lot of work. (beat) One could hypothetically imagine.
None whatsoever! But, can I ask you  something? When you were with Angel,  and nobody knew about it, did that make  things feel, you know… sexier, somehow?
Huh.
No reason. Just wondering. Gotta keep  asking the big ol' questions when you're  blessed with this girl's thirst for  knowledge and okay I admit it there's  something I have to tell you.
Okay. This'll make me feel better, right? (big breath) I've always thought of myself as a good  person. Floss, do my homework, never  cheat. But lately, and please don't  judge me, but… I just want you to be  the first to know that, that… there's  a demon behind you.
Oh. I, um, opened my S.A.T. test  booklet five minutes early. Doesn't  seem that important now, does it?
Shut up and help me.
It's either the catalyst for Living  Flame, or just some really smelly  sand. We have to test it.
What.
There's no time to test this.
What do you think Buffy and Angel  are gonna do?
He saved me from a horrible flamey  death. That sort of makes me like  him again.
The whole Angel thing is so weird.
