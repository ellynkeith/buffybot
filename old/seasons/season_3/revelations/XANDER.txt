You can, you have, and you will in  our future, I'm sure.
What, I just like you.
Hear, hear.
You got it.
(to crowd) Thank you, we're here through Saturday, enjoy the veal.
Let's see… killing Zombies, torching  sewer monsters, freeing the enslaved  populace of a parallel dimension…  nope. She's pretty much the same  old Buffster.
But we're the best of Buffy's bestest  buds. She'd tell us.
Hey, you're not the Watcher of me.
The number of a qualified surgeon who  can remove the British flag up his butt.
Right. Stop means no and no means  no, so, stop.
(changing subject) W-What've you got?
The big one in the Restfield cemetery.  I know it well.
Where's Buffy at?
Well I could stake out this crypt, give  her a heads up if she shows…
Hey Giles - here's a nifty idea. Why  don't I alleviate my guilt by going out  and getting myself really, really killed?
Giles. We have a big problem.  It's Buffy.
(cool) Not yet. But it's only a matter of time.
Hope not - because I <u>think</u> you're  harboring a vicious killer -
Better for how long, Buffy? Have  you even thought about that?
For what? For Angel to go psycho  again the next time you give him a  happy?
What? You tripped and fell on his lips?
You'd stop him. Like you did last time  with Ms. Calendar.
Right. Good plan. Leave tons of  firepower with the scary guy. (to Buffy/pointed) And leave us to clean up the mess.
I don't need an "excuse." I think  "lots of dead people" actually constitutes  a <b>reason</b>.
Rough day.
Rather just shoot.
Yeah? And what was that?
The Glove of Myhnegon? Right.  How'd you like a hit of some real news: (beat) Angel's still alive.
Back in town. Saw him myself. Toting  the famous and popular glove.
Said the same thing to Buffy myself.  Weird how she didn't seem to care.
She says he's clean.
Can I come?
Good old Sunnydale Library. Comes  fully equipped with reference books,  file cards…
…and weapons.
I call crossbow.
All right. Ready to go?
Wait.
Oh my God. Giles!
Giles - can you hear me? What happened?
(dialing 911) Hold it - stop - think a minute.
This isn't Angel's style.
Bite marks would be nice… (into phone) I have a medical emergency.  Sunnydale High.
Faith - we don't help, Giles could die!
Wait!
Damn it!
Your boyfriend's not as "cured"  as you thought.
We saw what you saw.
I didn't. Faith did.
Only what everyone knows. She's a  big girl. Came to her own conclusions.
Ten minutes.
Because she's a Vampire Slayer.
(in Latin) "…deinde addends dimidium  laterem ungularum bisulcarum  contusarum…"
(English translation) "…adding then half the ingot  of ground, cloven hooves…" (stops) And that's all she wrote.  Think we got it?
Let me double-check…
I know what the glove does.
We'll get it.
What are you - stop! Guys, listen!
A little Living Flame, a little mesquite…  gone for good.
Then we're telling it wrong.
Boy do I don't know.
Well, as long as he and Buffy don't  get pelvic, we'll be okay. I guess.
Yeah. Seeing you kissing him, after  everything that happened… leaned  me toward the postal. But I trust you.
You get the I-told-you-so.
