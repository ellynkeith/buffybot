This was a topic of discussion?
Well, I wouldn't use the word "dating,"  but I am… going out with somebody.  Tonight.
Really, we're just good friends.
Synchronized slaying.
What do you think?
Ooh, academic probation's not so  funny today, is it Giles?
Him?
She's an interesting lady. Can we  kill her?
Angel…
I gotta go. Big night for us slayer-types.  People to see, demons to kill, you know  the drill. Better hurry before somebody  figures out what we're doing.
Training. And almost kissing. I'm  sorry. It's just… old habit. Bad habit.  Habit to be broken.
It's not that hard. Cold turkey. That's  the key to quitting.
Do you think they have a patch for this?
I really do.
I'm gonna vent a little hormonal angst  by going out there and killing a  Lagos, whatever that is.
Yeah, he's some kind of Demon looking  for an all-powerful thingimibob and  I've got to stop him before unholy  havoc's unleashed and it's another  Tuesday night in Sunnydale.
You can trust some guys. Really.  I've read about them.
Like, me and boys me? Not much to  tell, these days.
Life with Angel's complicated. Was.  It's… a little hard to talk about.
All the Angel issues, they're still kind  of with me, so… you know?
I am kind of beat… but Shady Hill  is pretty close.
Alone? I don't want -
Okay…
Oh, God…
What am I doing? What are YOU doing?
Shame on you! Oh, God. I… I don't  even know why I came back here.
Great. Just, wherever this was  giftwrapped? Remind me not to shop  there.
The world's ugliest fashion  accessory.
So, no touching. Kind of like us.
Sorry. Cheap shot, I know. (sighs) But at least the glove's safe. You hold  onto it, I'll tell Giles in the morning. (a yearning beat) At least <b>he'll</b> be happy.
Hey, enough with the tragedy masks.  Lagos is outta luck - I found the magic  mitten thingy!
What? Is somebody hurt?
It's… It's not what you think.
But he's better now. Willow cured  him and - somehow - he came back.
What is this? Demons Anonymous?  I mean, I don't need an intervention  here -
I was going to tell you! But I didn't  know why he was back or anything.  I wanted to wait -
I'm not going to - We're not together  like that!
You were spying on me? What gives  you the right?
It - it was an accident!
It was wrong. It can't happen again.  But I - I'd never put you guys in danger.  If I thought Angel was going to hurt anyone -
But - he's good again. I swear. He  even found the Glove of Myhnegon  for us. It's at the mansion.
You'd love an excuse to hurt him,  wouldn't you?
Right, this is all nobility, you're not  jealous or anything -
Don't start with me -
Thanks for the bail. I know this is a  lot to absorb, but Angel did find the  glove. That's good, right? Angel did  a good…
Giles…
Hey.
So, on a scale of one to a million, how  much are you hating me right now?
Okay. Mother Theresa? Could you  stop possessing the body of Willow  now. I need to talk to Willow.
(a little confused) I guess…
None of the above. I want to kill this  Lagos guy. Peace offering to Giles.
Yeah. But Lagos doesn't know that.  Sooner or later he's bound to turn up  at that crypt looking for it.
We are the great strategists of our day.
(shrugs) Tried calling, no one home. But if  you're feeling any Demon-o-phobia,  please. Splitting's totally an option.  You're not the one in trouble with Giles.
How long you think he can stay mad,  anyway?
Guess I can't really blame him. But  you know - it's weird. Now that my  secret is out with Angel, I feel… better.
You have no idea.
Like, the forbidden fruit's sweeter  kind of deal? Not really. Too much  pressure. After awhile, it even makes  the fun parts… not so fun.
What makes you think all the secret  stuff is sexy, anyway?
What?
We'll pick up in a minute.
Okay. A plan "B" would be nice.
Now we're talking.
So what were you going to tell me?
My lips are sealed. Come on.
Let's go bring Giles some happiness.
Giles HAS to be psyched that we  showed up stuffy old Mrs. Post -
Oh, God.
What happened?
What happened?
What makes you think Angel did this?
So you just assume…
What did you tell her?
How much of a head start's she got?
Why's she doing this?
She's not killing Angel. (to Willow) Check Giles' research, find a way to  destroy the glove. I'm going to stop Faith.
Can't let you do it, Faith.
Faith, there's a lot you don't understand.
Faith, no…
We can figure this out -
Can you draw her fire?
Then do it.
I'm getting that.
What are you guys talking about?
He's not my boyfriend. Really and  truly. He's… I don't know.
Are we okay?
Let me guess. Gwendolyn Post,  not a watcher.
I'd better go. Little more damage  control.
Place looks nice.
How are you doing?
I'm interpreting that as good…
Mrs. Post, or whoever she was, she  fooled us all. Even Giles.
This may sound funny coming from  someone who just spent a lot of time  kicking your face, but you can trust <b>me</b>.
I know I've kept secrets, but I didn't  have a choice. I'm on your side.
Not always.
I guess…
Yeah.
(stops) Yes?
