That's too bad. 'cause I bet you'd  look way "double oh seven" in a tux.
Don't go there! I shop there!
Xander...
I'm considering things more carefully  these days.  (pointedly) Don't want to get stuck with another dud.
Yes! Yes, I'm working here.
I'm trying to buy a dress.
I have nothing! Okay? No dresses,  no cell phone, no car -- everything  got taken away because DADDY  made a little mistake on his taxes  for the last twelve years! Satisfied?  Are you a happy Xander now?  I'm broke. I can't go to any of the  colleges that accepted me and I can't  stay home because we no longer have one.
Yeah, neato. You can run along and  tell all your friends how Cordy  finally got hers, how she has to  work part time just to get a lousy  prom dress on layaway. How she  has to wear a name tag.
Yeah, I'm a name tag person! Don't  leave that out; the story just wouldn't  have the same punch!
The other part that totally weirded  me out? That thing had good taste.  I mean, he chucked Xander and  went right for the formal wear.
I'm serious! Look at Xander's outfit.  Now look at the kid the monster  went after. Very smooth lines, till  he was shredded.
Look! Right there. Zoom in on that.
So? They do it on TV all the time.
What? Um. I was...
(full of herself) Oh, are we all catching up now?
I hate myself for saying this. I haven't  finished paying for it.
What? Who...?
It's a start...
(with obvious meaning) Yes. Thank you.
(still smiling) Well, duh.
