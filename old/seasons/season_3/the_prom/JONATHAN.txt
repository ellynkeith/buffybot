We have one more award to give  out... Is Buffy Summers here tonight?  Did she, uh...
This is actually a new category,  first time ever, I guess there were  a lot of write in ballots... and, uh,  the prom committee has asked me  to read this.
(reads) We're not good friends.
(reads) Most of us never found the time  to get to know you. But that doesn't  mean we haven't noticed you. We  don't talk about it much, but it's  no secret Sunnydale High isn't really  like other schools. A lot of weird  stuff happens here.
(reads) But whenever there was a problem  or something creepy happened, you  seemed to show up and stop it.  Most of the people here have been  saved by you,  (looks to her) or helped by you, at one time or another. (reading again) We're proud to say that the class of  '99 has the lowest mortality rate of  any graduating class in Sunnydale history.
(reads) And we know at least part of that  is because of you. So the senior  class offers its thanks, and ...  gives you, uh, this...
It's from all of us, and it's got written  here, "Buffy Summers. Class Protector."
