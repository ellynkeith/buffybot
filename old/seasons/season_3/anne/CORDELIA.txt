Hey, Willow.
(putting her bag on the counter while she takes off her jacket) I can't believe you brought that up. Las Palmas was the <u>nightmare</u> resort. They order you around, they make you have organized (making quotemarks) "fun", and I make sarcastic quotemarks, plus the fact that there are cockroaches in Mexico big enough to own property. It was all about dread.
So, how was your summer?
Is Xander here?
(obviously excited) Good. Great. I haven't seen him yet. Do I look okay? How's my hair?
He didn't meet anybody over the summer, did he? No, this is Sunnydale, who could he meet except for monsters and stuff,  then again he's always kind of attracted to monsters . . .  How's my hair?
(fear) Maybe he's forgotten me. (lust) Well, I'll make him remember. See ya.
Hey.
It was all right.
Yeah.
Yeah, whatever.
Why do I have to be bait? I'm always bait! Let Willow be bait.
I only offered to help for Buffy's sake. It had nothing to do with you.
Well, where do I hide?
What's the plan?
And then what?
Oh, yeah, like you were Mr. Faithful. Probably met some hot little inca mummy girl -- yeah, I heard about her --
Xander!
