(crossing to them) Hi. Are you here to donate blood?
Rickie, sure. He's not here . . .
Let me check the sheet.
(returning) Sorry, guys. He hasn't been here.
I'll tell him you were looking . . .
What are you doing?
I'm calling the police.
You're gonna get yourself in a lot of trouble.
Nothing! I just . . . give him names. He likes to know who . . . I give him the names of the healthy ones.
