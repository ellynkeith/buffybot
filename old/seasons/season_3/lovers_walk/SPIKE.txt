Home sweet... home...
(sings) Mistakes... I've made a few... I ate it up... and spit it out... and did it my way...
Home...
Drusilla... I'm home...
Why'd you do it, baby? Why'd you leave me? We were happy here...
You stupid, worthless bitch! Look what you've done to me!
All right. Enough moping. Who can I kill?
Yeah, you... you think I'm afraid of you? We were happy, you brainwashed her... I can just --
Yeah. I'll show you who's... cool guy. You're going down.
Ack! Blahng!
This is just too much.
Yeah. I need a curse.
A curse! Something nasty -- boils. I wanna give him boils. All over his face, dripping pustules, let's really go for the gusto here.
Leprosy! A spell that makes his parts fall off, that sounds proper.
Forget the book.
I just got a better idea.
I need to borrow the little girl. You don't mind, do you?
(tipsiness showing) Are you threatening me? Not nice. We're all gonna be very best friends.
A spell. For me. You're gonna do a spell for me.
(really bellows) A love spell! Are you brain dead?
I'm gonna get what's mine. What's MINE. Teach her to walk out on me... what are you staring at?
You can do it, right? Make Dru love me again? Make her crawl?
What are you talking to me about trying? You'll do it!
You lie to me, I'll shove this through your face! Do you want that? All the way through to your brain!
She wouldn't even kill me.
She just left. She didn't even care enough to cut off my head, or light me on fire. Was that so much to ask? Some little sign that she cared?
It was that truce with Buffy that did it. Dru said I'd gone soft; wasn't demon enough for the likes of her. I said it didn't mean anything, I was thinking of her the whole time; she didn't care. We got to Brazil and she was just different, just... I gave her everything... jewels, beautiful dresses -- with beautiful girls in them, nothing made her happy. And she would flirt... I caught her on a park bench making out with a Chaos Demon -- have you ever seen a Chaos Demon? They're all slime and antlers, they're disgusting; she only did it to hurt me... I said I wasn't putting up with it anymore, she said fine, I said, yeah, I've got an unlife, you know... and she said... she said we could still be friends! Oh-God, I'm so unhappy!
(into her neck) Friends! How could she be so cruel?
Mmmmm... your neck, that smell...
I haven't had a woman in weeks --
Well, unless you count that shopkeeper...
All right. Get started.
Well, if at first you don't succeed, (re: Xander) I kill him and you try again.
What?
You've got one, though? At home?
Where?
So I happen to walk by, and she's making out with a Chaos Demon! And I said, you know, I don't have to put up with this, and she said, fine, and I said, fine, do whatever you want! I thought we'd make up, you know...
She is! She's out of her mind! That's what I miss most about her...
But this is different! Our love was eternal! Literally! You got any of those little marshmallows?
Yeah, you're not invited!
Not while I breathe! Well, actually I don't...
You're a very bad man.
Yah? You and what army?
I do what I please.
Willow!
You do me now, and you'll never find the little witch.
Him too.
Doesn't work like that, peaches, and when did you become all soul-having again? I thought you outgrew that. (to Buffy) Your friend's gonna work a little magic for me. She does my spell, I let them both go.
You and your great poof here want to tag along, fine. But get in my way, and you kill your friends.
Just need a few supplies, then I'll take you -- ohhhh...
My head. I think I'm sobering up. It's horrible. Ugh. I wish I was dead.
Back off!
How thick do you think I am?
Oh, God.
(welling up) We killed a homeless man on this bench. Me and Dru. Good times... (laughs affectionately) He begged for mercy, and that just made her bite harder...
(ignoring her) Here's the list.
I used to bring her rats... With the morning paper...
The spell's gonna get her back.
Shut your gob.
Shut up!
What do you know? It's your fault, the both of you! She belongs with me. (maudlin again) I'm nothing without her.
Yeah, and you're one to talk.
Last time I looked in on you, you two were fighting to the death. Now you're back to making googly eyes at each other like nothing happened. Makes me want to heave.
Oh, sure, you're just friends.
You're not friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it kills you both. You'll fight, you'll shag, you'll hate each other till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Real love isn't brains, children, it's blood, it's blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.
Eye of rat.
What's your hurry?
Well, I'll be out of your life in a few short hours. No trouble at all.
Lenny... how've you been?
Is that right?
That pissant used to work for me!
(to Buffy) I die, your chums die...
This should be a kick...
Soft?
Well, then. Let's give Baby a taste.
Baby like his supper? Baby like his supper?
Why doesn't baby have a nap?
Now that was fun. (off their looks) Don't tell me that wasn't fun. GOD! It's been so long since I had a decent spot of violence! (smiles contemplatively) Really puts things in perspective.
Oh yeah. You two. Just friends. No danger there.
Oh, sod the spell. Your friends are in the factory. (off her surprised look) I'm glad I came here, you know? I been all wrongheaded about this. Weeping, crawling, blaming everybody else. I want Dru back, I just have to be the man I was. The man she loved. I'm gonna do what I shoulda done in the first place. I'll find her, wherever she is... and I'll tie her up and torture her until she likes me again.
Love's a funny thing...
