Look at that. Every time, cuts to the left. And it's not the carpet. It's me.
I swear, I would sell my soul for a decent short game. (chuckles) Of course, it's a little late for that... Don't suppose I could offer YOUR soul? Really help me on the green...
I'm just funnin'. So, we have a Spike problem, do we?
He's been spotted back in town. And there was an incident at a magic shop -- in broad daylight. The police had a hell of a time covering it up.
(fondly) Well, yes, he got up to all sorts of shenanigans last year. Had a world of fun just trying to guess what he'd do next! Funny guy.
I remember.
But I guess we're past that, now. This year is too important to let a loose cannon rock the boat.
Should I have Mr. Trick send a... committee to deal with this?
Loose cannon. Rock the boat. Now is that a mixed metaphor?
Uh, I don't know...
Boats did have cannons. And a loose one would cause it to rock... Honestly, I don't know where my mind goes sometimes. Why don't you take care of this Spike problem. A committee, like you said.
It's good as done.
That's swell. Fore!
