These scores -- what do they really mean?
That thought had occurred to me...
I don't know. I guess... My future. Never really thought about it. Wasn't sure I was gonna have one.
So is this... Where IS this retreat thing -- the Yukon?
Okay, but it's just a few days, right? You're not gonna settle there and grow crops or anything.
Giles, you pack like me.
Oh yeah. She saw these scores, her head spun around and exploded.
Yes. She was happy. Started up with all kinds of crazy talk about me going to college, maybe going somewhere... else...
I know, I told her you'd have a goat, I mean, responsibilities and all, I know the drill --
Yeah, I figured you'd -- (stops) Whoakay. Be kind, rewind. May be right?
Wow.
Anything rash meaning...?
(gets his meaning) Well, yeah, but Giles, there's not gonna be any rash. Anywhere. We're friends, and that's all either of us wants. Nothing's gonna happen.
Couldn't we do this another time? This whole day, everyone's like, "Congratulations. Go away."
Not really seeing a huge distinction there...
It's not that simple, Mom. I have responsibilities.
That Faith could be Miss Sunnydale in the Slayer pageant. I know.
Higher education. Kind of an intense proposition.
Oh, I don't even know. Mom's just so pumped, she grabbed all of these. She can't stop talking about it -- I had a really hard time coming up with an alibi to get over here.
Big no. She's having enough trouble dealing with the Slayer issue; I don't think she's ready to process the information about us being... friends again.
I think the whole college jones is kind of her reacting to the Slayer thing.
Somewhere a little less hellmouthy. And she has a point... but there's reasons to stay, too.
Well, uh, you know, Slayer duties, and... what do you think I should do?
Yeah. Well, 'cause there really isn't any great reason to stay, I guess.
Thanks for the advice. Another perspective to weigh in there. I better get back.
Yeah, but Mom... she starts worrying a lot earlier these days. I'll stop by soon.
Not all of us have dates tonight.
What is all this stuff? Cause I'm thinking WEIRD science.
Whatever happened, there was a fight.
Either they ran, or they were taken, or...
I'm not sure. I need you guys to find Giles. I'll look around -- maybe they didn't go far.
He's at some retreat up near the clearing in Breaker's woods.
So motor.
Giles?
Mom. No, I'm...
That's great, mom, but now's not really...
That would be me.
(eyes on Spike) Angel. Why don't you come on in.
You shouldn't have come back.
You took Willow.
(to Spike) And Xander?
You're not famous for keeping promises.
What's wrong, not that I care?
(pulling out a stake) Well, if you close your eyes and wish real hard...
(sulkily) "Need him." He's probably just got 'em locked up in the factory.
All right. Let's just get this done.
I guess you had to be there.
Your work?
"Essence of violet" -- Angel?
"Cloves, set of runic tablets" -- and Spike, you can find the rats eyes.
Oh, good, more moping. That's really gonna win her back, Spike.
That one I'm gonna back up. (goes back to looking around) It's just pathetic. You're not even a loser anymore. You're a shell of a loser.
Meaning what?
Excuse me! There's no eye googling here.
We got the stuff. So where are they?
My hurry is my intense desire to get you out of my life. You tend to make trouble.
No trouble at all...
You know, he was just leaving... (to Spike) Don't you start something.
My friends are in trouble. We cannot risk this.
(to Lenny) I guess we're staying.
The window!
I violently dislike you.
We have to get out of here.
Angel!
You're not at full strength yet.
We'll get out the back --
Oh, my.
Spike... Get down.
I got you...
Let's just do the damn spell, all right?
So, Cordy's okay.
Has she talked to Xander?
And Oz?
Give it some time. And get ready to grovel.
Good. You know, sometimes that can really work.
I'm not coming back.
We're not friends. Never were. I can fool Giles, I can fool my friends, but I can't fool myself. Or Spike, for some reason. What I want from you, I can never have. You don't need me to take care of you any more, so I'm gonna go.
You have to.
There is. Just tell me you don't love me.
