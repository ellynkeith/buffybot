Yeah, I can see why you'd be upset. (off their looks) That was my sarcastic voice.
I've been told that. But I'm thinking we should celebrate. Do something.
Scores like that, you can apply pretty much anywhere you want.
What's the verdict? Do we bowl?
Gift.
Pretty much you are.
Kind of a theme present. Do you like it?
Hmm. Never seen a werewolf Pez. Might have to settle for a wacky cartoon dog.
Well, I think about you.
Yes you do.
Something's up.
There's no blood.
I know the spot. But it's like a 45-minute drive.
It's Willow. She's nearby
She's afraid...
I really agree...
(emotionless) We have to get out of here.
