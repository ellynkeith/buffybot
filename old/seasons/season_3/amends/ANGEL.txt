Why, Daniel, wherever are you  going?
Not of late, no.
Well, it happens that I'm hungry, Daniel, and seeing as you're somewhat in my debt...
A man playing at cards should have  a natural intelligence or a great deal of money and you're sadly lacking  in both. So I'll take my winnings  my own way.
Daniel. Be of good cheer. (smiling) It's Christmas!
Hi.
Couldn't sleep.
Not as a rule.
I'm all right. You?
I'm... I'm sorry to bother you.
I need your help.
I understand that I have no right to ask for it, but... there's no one else. Will you at least hear me out?
I can't come in unless you invite me.
I've been seeing... I've had dreams, lately, about... the past. It's like I'm living it again, it's so vivid. I need to... (he faces Giles) I need to know why I'm here.
I should be in a demon dimension suffering an eternity of torture.
But I'm not. I was freed. And I don't understand why.
Where have you looked? We could  compare notes --
It might.
(to Jenny) I killed you...
Don't you see her?
I can't --
Margaret, Margaret... there's no hurry.
Mistress will be wondering how she can get the good Reverend Chalmers into bed and will not notice the absence of canapes. Stay with me. Tell me about yourself.
Then you'd best keep quiet.
Cry out. Call for help. I'm sure mistress will believe your behavior beyond reproach.
Come! Make a scene! Shall I?
No.
We shall be quiet as mice.
No matter what.
He'll make a fine dessert.
You're not here.
Leave me alone...
What do you want?
I'm sorry...
I am sorry. For what I've done -- What else can I say to you?
Oh, God...
It wasn't me.
A demon isn't a man. I was a man once.
I was... young... I never had the chance to --
Stop it!
That's not true...
No...
No!
Buffy...
I had to see you... I don't know. You shouldn't be...
(to Buffy) You have to stay away from me.
I think you're the one who's confused. It think you need to...
Leave me alone!
I can't do it!
Get away from me!
I'll never hurt her.
Then I'll die.
I don't need strength. I just need the sun to rise.
(looking down at the town) I bet half the kids down there are already awake. Lying in their beds, sneaking downstairs... (looks up at the sky) . . . waiting for day.
I know. I can smell the sunrise long before it comes.
It wasn't haunting me. It was just showing me.
What I am.
And ever shall be. I wanted to know why I was back. Now I do.
I can't do it again, Buffy. I can't become a killer.
It's <b>too hard</b>.
It told me to kill you. You were in the dream, you know -- it told me to take you, to lose my soul in you and become a monster again.
Because I wanted to! Because I want you so badly, I want to take comfort in you and I know it'll cost me my soul and a part of me doesn't care. I'm weak. I've never been anything else. It's not the demon in me that needs killing, Buffy. It's the man.
Just go.
You think this is simple. You think there's an answer. You can never understand what I've done. Now go!
Leave!
(bitterly) Am I a thing worth saving? Am I a righteous man? <b>The world wants  me gone</b>.
Buffy, please... just this once... let me be strong.
Buffy --
