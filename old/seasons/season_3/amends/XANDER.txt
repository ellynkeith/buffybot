Angel? Weird? What are the odds?
Must be that whole Angel-killed-his- girlfriend-and-tortured-him thing. Giles is really petty about stuff  like that.
You doing anything special?
Well, I'll be enjoying my annual Christmas Eve camp out. I take my sleeping bag outside, go to sleep on the grass.
I like to look at the stars, feel the whole nature vibe.
Yes, and that was a confidence I was hoping you'd share with others.
Stuck up, arrogant...
She talked to me! That's the first time -- (off their looks, deflating) I'm aware that it's over.
Yeah, Will's got the Christmas spirit.
Where do we start?
I'm aware that I haven't been the mostest best friend to you when it comes to the Angel thing. And, I don't know. Maybe I finally got the Chanukah spirit.
This is actually the most exciting thing I've got planned. Who else can claim that pathetic a social life?
We gotta stop 'em.
If we can find them.
Not during the day. What do you  got in mind?
Yeah, let me get a double shot of -- (off Buffy's look) -- of information, pal.
How about I ring that bell for you? (off Buffy's other look) Does the threatening come now?
The Bringers --
The underground.
See you round.
Really? Thanks.
Man, is it hot. It was so nice and cool in there.
We know underground, that's a start...
Plus a lot of natural cave formations and a gateway to hell, yeah... (looking about him) -- this does resemble square one.
I think right now the best plan is to deck the halls with boughs of holly. (looking at his watch) We're gettin' toward the eve, might as well try and make something resembling merry.
And Uncle Roary will be well into  the sherry by now. Don't wanna miss  that. (sincerely) We'll find the badguys, sooner or later.
Don't mention it. Well, actually mention it as often as possible. In front of everyone. In fact, while you're heaping me with praise, if you could also bring up my manly physique, that'd be a plus. Not compulsory, but...
