ANGEL: Why, Daniel, wherever are you  going?
DANIEL: You -- you're not human...
ANGEL: Not of late, no.
DANIEL: What do you want?
ANGEL: Well, it happens that I'm hungry, Daniel, and seeing as you're somewhat in my debt...
DANIEL: Please... I can't...
ANGEL: A man playing at cards should have  a natural intelligence or a great deal of money and you're sadly lacking  in both. So I'll take my winnings  my own way.
DANIEL: The lord is my shepherd, I shall  not want... he maketh me to lie  down in green pastures... he...
ANGEL: Daniel. Be of good cheer. (smiling) It's Christmas!
WEATHERMAN: . . . it's gonna be sunny and warm, with temperatures continuing in the high 70's throughout the holiday weekend. A little warm to light the yule log, but it should make for a very nice Christmas.
BUFFY: Oh!
ANGEL: Hi.
BUFFY: Hi.
BUFFY: So, are you... shopping? You're probably not shopping.
ANGEL: Couldn't sleep.
BUFFY: Vampires probably not that big on Christmas, now I'm thinking about it...
ANGEL: Not as a rule.
BUFFY: But you're doing okay.
ANGEL: I'm all right. You?
BUFFY: Yeah! I'm good. Just, uh, getting some presents for the gang. I  should probably hurry, I gotta get  to the magic shop... Angel?
BUFFY: Angel?
BUFFY: What is it?
BUFFY: And then he just bailed. Didn't say anything; just took off. It was weird.
XANDER: Angel? Weird? What are the odds?
WILLOW: Do you think there's something  wrong? Should you maybe tell Giles.
BUFFY: No... I don't want to bug Giles. He's still pretty twitchy about the subject of Angel.
XANDER: Must be that whole Angel-killed-his- girlfriend-and-tortured-him thing. Giles is really petty about stuff  like that.
BUFFY: Xander, enough. Okay?
WILLOW: I bet Angel just has the holiday blues. Everybody gets 'em. (thinking of herself) Especially when they're alone.
BUFFY: It's just so aggravating. I'm  trying to do the right thing, stay away from him, get over it and then... boom. There he is. I just want a nice quiet Christmas vacation.
XANDER: You doing anything special?
BUFFY: (shaking her head) Tree. Nog. Roast beast. Just me and Mom and hopefully an excess  of gifts. (to Willow) What are you doing for Christmas?
WILLOW: (work with me, people) Being Jewish. Remember, people?  Not everyone worshipping Santa  here.
BUFFY: (smiling) Sorry. For <b>vacation</b>.
WILLOW: Nothing fun. Oz and I had planned... but I guess that's off.
XANDER: Well, I'll be enjoying my annual Christmas Eve camp out. I take my sleeping bag outside, go to sleep on the grass.
BUFFY: That sounds fun.
XANDER: I like to look at the stars, feel the whole nature vibe.
CORDELIA: I thought you slept outside to avoid your family's drunken Christmas fights.
XANDER: Yes, and that was a confidence I was hoping you'd share with others.
CORDELIA: Well, I'll be in Aspen. Skiing. With actual snow.
BUFFY: I hear that helps.
CORDELIA: It must be a drag to be stuck here in  Sweatydale, but I'm thinking of you. (beat) Okay, I'm done.
XANDER: Stuck up, arrogant...
XANDER: She talked to me! That's the first time -- (off their looks, deflating) I'm aware that it's over.
BUFFY: She certainly has reverted to form.
WILLOW: It's not her fault. After what happened, I think we gotta cut her some slack.
BUFFY: You're right.
XANDER: Yeah, Will's got the Christmas spirit.
WILLOW: Hello, still Jewish. Chanukah spirit, I believe that was. Anyway, forgiveness is pretty much a big theme with me this year. You know, 'cause --
OZ: Hey.
WILLOW: Hey.
OZ: Okay. The thing is... seeing you with Xander, it was... Well, I never felt that way before -- when there wasn't a full moon. But I've thought about it a lot. And I know you guys have a history.
WILLOW: But it's a history that's in the past. Well, I guess most history is in the past... but it's over.
OZ: I don't know. I don't know if it ever will be, with you two.
WILLOW: Oz, please believe me --
OZ: This is what I do know. I miss you. Every second. It's like I've lost an arm. Worse. A torso. So I'm  thinking I'd be willing to give it a shot.
WILLOW: Really?
OZ: Yeah.
WILLOW: Do you want us to hug now?
OZ: I'm good for that.
JOYCE: Ooh! Do you want to get one with snow on it? That'd be very Christmassy.
BUFFY: I think those are just for display.
JOYCE: Oh. (as they walk) You know, honey. I was thinking -- maybe we should invite Faith to spend Christmas Eve with us.
BUFFY: I don't know, Mom. Faith and I don't really hang out, or talk, or make eye contact lately.
JOYCE: Well, now, honey, you're both slayers, and she doesn't have any family here. Do you really want to let her spend Christmas Eve all by herself in that dingy little motel room?
BUFFY: You're still number one with a guilt trip, Mom.
JOYCE: I try.
BUFFY: I'll ask her. Worst she can do is -- well, the worst <b>she</b> can do is serious bodily harm, but she'll probably just say no.
JOYCE: You're a dear.
BUFFY: Hey, what about Giles? He doesn't have family here.
JOYCE: (quickly) No I'm sure he's fine.
BUFFY: Well, I could ask --
JOYCE: He doesn't want to spend Christmas Eve with a bunch of girls. Let's split up.
GUY: Bunch of 'em up and died on us. Don't know why. If you want one  I'll make you a hell of a deal.
BUFFY: No thanks.
FAITH: Come on... don't die on me now... (knock at the door) Yeah!
FAITH: Hey, how's it going. (hits TV) Work, dammit!
BUFFY: Hey.
FAITH: What's going on? Scary monsters?
BUFFY: Nope. I just... well we're having Christmas Eve dinner at my place,  and if you didn't have plans...
FAITH: (smiling) Your mom sent you down, huh?
BUFFY: No! I just thought, if you were bored -- not that it's gonna be wild fun at our house, but --
FAITH: Well, thanks, but I got plans. There's a big party I been invited to, it should be a blast.
BUFFY: Oh, good. Cool. You know, but, if you change your mind...
FAITH: It's nice of you, thanks. But I got, I got that big party that I been invited to.
BUFFY: I like the lights.
FAITH: Yeah, well, 'tis the season. Whatever that means.
GILES: Just a second!
GILES: Hello.
ANGEL: I'm... I'm sorry to bother you.
GILES: I'm sorry. Coming from you, that phrase strikes me as funny. Sorry  to bother me.
ANGEL: I need your help.
GILES: And the funny keeps on coming.
ANGEL: I understand that I have no right to ask for it, but... there's no one else. Will you at least hear me out?
GILES: All right.
ANGEL: I can't come in unless you invite me.
GILES: I'm aware of that.
GILES: Come in.
ANGEL: I've been seeing... I've had dreams, lately, about... the past. It's like I'm living it again, it's so vivid. I need to... (he faces Giles) I need to know why I'm here.
GILES: Here? Back on Earth?
ANGEL: I should be in a demon dimension suffering an eternity of torture.
GILES: I don't feel particularly inclined to  argue with that.
ANGEL: But I'm not. I was freed. And I don't understand why.
GILES: Well, I haven't any easy answers; I've looked into the matter, but so far I haven't come across any being with the power to pull someone out  of Hell.
ANGEL: Where have you looked? We could  compare notes --
GILES: Knowing why you're back might give you some peace of mind?
ANGEL: It might.
GILES: And is that something you think  you ought to have?
GILES: To be blunt, the last time you became complacent about your existence, it turned out rather badly.
ANGEL: (to Jenny) I killed you...
GILES: You tried, certainly, but --
GILES: What are you staring at?
ANGEL: Don't you see her?
GILES: See whom?
ANGEL: I can't --
MARGARET: Sir, please... I should return to the party...
ANGEL: Margaret, Margaret... there's no hurry.
MARGARET: Mistress will be wondering...
ANGEL: Mistress will be wondering how she can get the good Reverend Chalmers into bed and will not notice the absence of canapes. Stay with me. Tell me about yourself.
MARGARET: Sir... people might talk -- I'll be put out in the street, my little boy would... I can't lose this job.
ANGEL: Then you'd best keep quiet.
MARGARET: You're hurting me.
ANGEL: Cry out. Call for help. I'm sure mistress will believe your behavior beyond reproach.
MARGARET: Please...
ANGEL: Come! Make a scene! Shall I?
MARGARET: No!
ANGEL: No.
ANGEL: We shall be quiet as mice.
ANGEL: No matter what.
MARGARET: Please... my son...
ANGEL: He'll make a fine dessert.
JENNY: Trouble sleeping?
ANGEL: You're not here.
JENNY: I'm always here.
ANGEL: Leave me alone...
JENNY: I can't. You won't let me.
JENNY: I'm a part of you now. You've taken me in.
ANGEL: What do you want?
JENNY: I want to die in bed, surrounded by fat grandchildren, but I guess that's off the menu.
ANGEL: I'm sorry...
JENNY: You're sorry? For what? For me? Don't bother. I'm dead; I'm over it. If you want to feel sorry for someone, feel sorry for yourself. Or, well, I think you've got that covered.
ANGEL: I am sorry. For what I've done -- What else can I say to you?
JENNY: I don't want to make you feel bad.
DANIEL: I just want to show you who you are.
GILES: You had a dream about Angel.
BUFFY: I was IN Angel's dream.
GILES: I'm not sure how --
BUFFY: There were things in that dream I  couldn't possibly know about. It was Angel's past, he was dreaming it and somehow I got sucked in. (beat) There's something wrong with him.
GILES: I know. I've seen him.
GILES: He wanted to know why he was back.
BUFFY: Is there a way for us to find out?
GILES: Possibly; I've been looking --
BUFFY: Well let me look too. We have to help him. (off his look) I'm not seeing him anymore. I'm trying to put all that behind me. And I'm not going to be able to as long as we're doing guest spots in each other's dreams.
BUFFY: So we'll help him?
GILES: Yes.
XANDER: Where do we start?
XANDER: I'm aware that I haven't been the mostest best friend to you when it comes to the Angel thing. And, I don't know. Maybe I finally got the Chanukah spirit.
GILES: Well, we start, not surprisingly, with research. (handing out books) Xander, the Black Chronicles. Buffy, the Diary of Lucious Temple. An acolyte of Acathla, expert on demons. You can skip the passages about his garden, unless you're keen on  growing heartier beets.
BUFFY: (to Xander) You're sure this is how you want to spend your Christmas vacation?
XANDER: This is actually the most exciting thing I've got planned. Who else can claim that pathetic a social life?
WILLOW: (looking in) Hey, guys! What're we doin'?
WILLOW: He's gonna come over for Christmas Eve, since my folks are out of town. We're gonna watch videos.
BUFFY: (leafing through book) So it's good, right? You guys are back.
WILLOW: It's good. It's perfect, in an awkward, uncomfortable sort of way. I just -- I don't know how to make  Oz trust me.
BUFFY: Well, he does have a point. Xander was your first love. That's... (thinking of herself) . . . that's hard to let go of. Xander has a piece of you that Oz can't touch. I guess it's just about  letting Oz know that he comes first  now.
WILLOW: (thinking) I guess... Thanks.
WILLOW: Hey! He likes beets.
BUFFY: Oh. I read that one already. (closes her own book) We're not getting any closer...
TRAVIS: The thing I remember most was thinking how artful it was. In the dark they looked like they were sleeping. It wasn't until I bent down and kissed them good night that I felt how cold they were. You grabbed me and I thought, "Who would go to so much trouble, to arrange them like that." In my panic, in my grief, it still struck me. But you  see...
MARGARET: That's what makes you different than other beasts. They kill to feed. But you, you took more kinds of pleasure in it than any creature that walks or crawls.
ANGEL: Oh, God...
MARGARET: (laughs) Yes! Cry out! Make a scene!
DANIEL: I was to be married that week. But then, as I recall, you knew that.
ANGEL: It wasn't me.
JENNY: It wasn't you?
ANGEL: A demon isn't a man. I was a man once.
JENNY: Oh, yes. And what man you were!
MARGARET: A drunken, whoring layabout and a terrible disappointment to your parents.
ANGEL: I was... young... I never had the chance to --
MARGARET: -- to die of syphilis? You were a worthless being before you were  ever a monster.
ANGEL: Stop it!
JENNY: Angel... I don't want to hurt you. But you have to understand. Cruelty is the only thing you ever had a true talent for.
ANGEL: That's not true...
JENNY: Rest... rest...
JENNY: You mistake it for a curse. Angel, it's not. It's your destiny. I'll show you.
JENNY: I'll show you...
JENNY: You want her.
ANGEL: No...
JENNY: Take her. Take what you want.  Pour all that frustration, all that  guilt into her and you'll be free.
ANGEL: No!
JENNY: You can't live for eternity with all that pain. This is what you are. This is why we brought you back. Take her. And then you'll be ready to kill her.
GILES: Buffy. Take a look. These letters contain references to an ancient power known as the First.
BUFFY: The First? The first what?
GILES: Evil. Absolute evil, older than man, than demons -- very few have heard  of it, fewer believe in it. But it is a force that transcends all realities, all dimensions, and if focused, could have had the power  to bring Angel back.
BUFFY: So it's evil. Which is bad.
GILES: Traditionally. But we don't know that this is --
BUFFY: Hey.
BUFFY: Him. In my dream. I fell asleep just now...
GILES: You had a dream? With Angel?
BUFFY: Yes.
GILES: What happened in the dream?
BUFFY: Let's not get sidetracked. Who are these guys?
GILES: They're known as the Bringers, or  the Harbingers... High priests of  the First. They can conjure spirit manifestations of the power, set  them on people. Influence them,  haunt them...
BUFFY: These guys are working the mojo  on Angel.
XANDER: We gotta stop 'em.
GILES: You can't fight the First, Buffy. It's not a physical being.
BUFFY: But I can fight these priest guys.
XANDER: If we can find them.
BUFFY: Xander, you busy tomorrow?
XANDER: Not during the day. What do you  got in mind?
BUFFY: Well, it's Christmas. Time to look up old friends.
WILLY: Hey, it's <b>the Slayer</b>! What brings <b>the Slayer</b> down here?
BUFFY: How you been, Willy?
WILLY: Keeping out of trouble, as God is  my witness. What can I do you  for? Couple drinks?
XANDER: Yeah, let me get a double shot of -- (off Buffy's look) -- of information, pal.
BUFFY: Have you ever heard of something called the First? Kind of an all powerful dark power sort of thingie?
WILLY: (thinks) Doesn't ring a bell.
XANDER: How about I ring that bell for you? (off Buffy's other look) Does the threatening come now?
BUFFY: Maybe you shouldn't help.
WILLY: Hey! Why with the threats? You drive away my customers, give me a  hard time and I don't know this First  guy!
BUFFY: All right. Three priests. They call them the uh...
XANDER: The Bringers --
BUFFY: The Bringers, the Harbingers...  They sort of have a "no eyes" kind  of look...
WILLY: I'm not sure...
BUFFY: They would have come to town recently, they'd be holed up somewhere, summoning a spirit of  the First.
WILLY: I really don't want to say anything that would get me in trouble.
BUFFY: You understand that I'm planning to skip the threatening portion of this exchange.
WILLY: Well, I heard a few things, you know, from the underground.
XANDER: The underground.
WILLY: Yeah, you know: from things that live under the ground. Apparently there's been a lot of migrations out of Sunnydale from the lower inhabitants. Something's scaring them off, and these are things that are not easily scared. could be your priest-types are underground. If the First is as bad as you say.
BUFFY: Underground where?
WILLY: I do not know. (off her look) Hey, my ass is on the line for telling you that much. If I knew more, I'd say.
BUFFY: All right. Thanks.
XANDER: See you round.
WILLY: (to Xander) Hey, you did great by the way. I  was very intimidated by you.
XANDER: Really? Thanks.
BUFFY: Come on.
WILLY: Hey kid! (she turns back) Merry Christmas.
XANDER: Man, is it hot. It was so nice and cool in there.
BUFFY: A nice cool waste of time.
XANDER: We know underground, that's a start...
BUFFY: In a town with fourteen million square miles of sewer --
XANDER: Plus a lot of natural cave formations and a gateway to hell, yeah... (looking about him) -- this does resemble square one.
BUFFY: (frustrated) I don't know what to do.
XANDER: I think right now the best plan is to deck the halls with boughs of holly. (looking at his watch) We're gettin' toward the eve, might as well try and make something resembling merry.
BUFFY: Yeah, Mom'll be looking for me.
XANDER: And Uncle Roary will be well into  the sherry by now. Don't wanna miss  that. (sincerely) We'll find the badguys, sooner or later.
BUFFY: Thanks, by the way.
XANDER: Don't mention it. Well, actually mention it as often as possible. In front of everyone. In fact, while you're heaping me with praise, if you could also bring up my manly physique, that'd be a plus. Not compulsory, but...
OZ: Hey. Will? It's me, I got some...
OZ: . . . videos...
WILLOW: Hi.
WILLOW: Why don't you come sit down.
OZ: You ever have that dream that you're in a play, and it's the middle of the play, and you really don't know your lines, and you kind of don't know the plot... ?
WILLOW: Well, we're alone, we're together... I just want it to be special.
OZ: How special are we talking?
WILLOW: (a tad flustered) Well, you know, we're alone, and we're both mature younger people, and, so, we could, I'm ready to, with you, we could do that thing.
WILLOW: Where are you going?
OZ: Not going. Dramatic gesture. That's pretty special.
WILLOW: I wanna be with you. First.
OZ: I think we should sit again.
WILLOW: (not 100% convincing) Oz, I'm ready.
OZ: Okay, well, don't take this the  wrong way, but I'm not.
WILLOW: Are you scared? 'Cause I thought  you had --
OZ: I have. But this is different. You look great, and you got the Barry working for you, and it's all good, but... when it happens, it should be 'cause we both need it to. For the same reason. You don't have to  prove anything to me.
WILLOW: But I just wanted you to know --
OZ: I know. I get the message.
WILLOW: Then can I change out of this outfit?
OZ: Not just yet.
BUFFY: Oh, yes, nothing like a roaring fire to keep away the blistering heat.
JOYCE: Oh, come on, it's lovely. (beat) Maybe I should turn on the air conditioning.
JOYCE: So, Angel's on top again?
BUFFY: (panicked) What?
JOYCE: Angel? Or star.
BUFFY: Oh. Star. Star.
JOYCE: Are you okay, honey? You've got faraway face.
BUFFY: I'm okay.
JOYCE: Is it a slaying thing?
FAITH: Hey.
BUFFY: Hi...
FAITH: Looked like that whole party thing was gonna be kind of a drag. And I didn't have anything... you know...
BUFFY: (warmly) I'm glad you came.
FAITH: Here.
FAITH: (indicating one gift) That one's for your mom. They're pretty crappy.
BUFFY: Well, come in from the entire lack of cold.
JOYCE: Faith, you made it! (re: gifts) That is so thoughtful.
FAITH: They're crappy.
BUFFY: Let me get mine, hold on.
JOYCE: (to Faith) Would you like some nog?
BUFFY: You're not allowed to touch yours, Mom, 'cause you'll know what it is right away --
BUFFY: Angel.
ANGEL: Buffy...
BUFFY: What is it?
ANGEL: I had to see you... I don't know. You shouldn't be...
BUFFY: Angel, stay calm. Just tell me what's going on.
JENNY: She wants you to touch her. What  are you waiting for?
ANGEL: (to Buffy) You have to stay away from me.
BUFFY: You came to see me to tell me I can't see you.
BUFFY: Angel, something is doing this to  you. You just have to control it. I know you're confused...
ANGEL: I think you're the one who's confused. It think you need to...
JENNY: She wants you to taste her. Think of the peace... you would never see us again.
BUFFY: Angel, please... how can I help  you?
ANGEL: Leave me alone!
BUFFY: I need you to stay here with Mom. In case he comes back.
FAITH: I'll play watchdog. I don't really get it, though.
BUFFY: I'll explain later. Everything, I promise.
FAITH: Watch your back.
BUFFY: Giles, we gotta do something. Soon. Now.
GILES: I'm still not sure what.
BUFFY: Find these high priest guys. Find me SOMETHING I can pummel.
GILES: We can't lose our heads.
BUFFY: Giles, he's slipping. He's... I think we're losing him.
GILES: You realize, if he truly becomes a danger, you may have to kill him. Again.
GILES: Can you do that?
ANGEL: I can't do it!
JENNY: You have to do it. What else are  you good for?
ANGEL: Get away from me!
JENNY: Couldn't you feel her? Couldn't you smell her skin? You're not a  fighter, Angel, don't start trying now. Sooner or later you will drink her.
ANGEL: I'll never hurt her.
JENNY: You were born to hurt her. Have  you learned nothing? As long as  you're alive --
ANGEL: Then I'll die.
JENNY: You haven't the strength to kill yourself.
ANGEL: I don't need strength. I just need the sun to rise.
JENNY: You're not supposed to die! This isn't the plan!
JENNY: But it'll do.
BUFFY: "and the child shall be born of goat and man, and will have two heads, the first shall speak in riddles..." (dumping it and grabbing another) No wonder you love these things. It's like reading the Star.
GILES: (re: his book) Yes! Ah. No. Well, maybe...
BUFFY: What? Priests?
GILES: Yes, but... more posturing, I'm afraid. (reads:) "For they are the harbingers of death, nothing shall grow above or below them, no seed shall flower, neither in Man nor..." They're rebels and they'll never ever be any good. Nothing specific about their haunts --
BUFFY: Let me see that.
BUFFY: ". . . the harbingers of death, nothing shall grow above or below..."
GILES: What.
BUFFY: All right. Ten more minutes of chanting then you have to go to bed.
JENNY: I'm impressed.
BUFFY: You won't get Angel.
JENNY: You think you can fight me. I'm not a demon, little girl. I'm something you can't conceive. The first evil. Beyond sin, beyond death... I am  the thing the darkness fears. You  will never see me, but I am  everywhere. Every being, every  thought, every drop of hate --
BUFFY: I <b>get it. <u>You're evil</u></b>. do we have to chat about it all day?
JENNY: Angel will be dead by sunrise. Your Christmas will be his wake.
BUFFY: No.
JENNY: You have no idea what you're  dealing with.
BUFFY: Let me guess... is it <b>evil</b>?
BUFFY: Angel!
BUFFY: Angel?
BUFFY: Angel, you have to come inside.
ANGEL: (looking down at the town) I bet half the kids down there are already awake. Lying in their beds, sneaking downstairs... (looks up at the sky) . . . waiting for day.
BUFFY: Angel, I need you to get inside. There's only a few minutes left --
ANGEL: I know. I can smell the sunrise long before it comes.
BUFFY: I don't have time to explain this. You have to trust me; that thing that was haunting you --
ANGEL: It wasn't haunting me. It was just showing me.
BUFFY: Showing you --
ANGEL: What I am.
BUFFY: <b>Were</b>.
ANGEL: And ever shall be. I wanted to know why I was back. Now I do.
BUFFY: You don't know. What, some great honking evil takes credit for bringing you back and you buy it? You just give up?
ANGEL: I can't do it again, Buffy. I can't become a killer.
BUFFY: Then you fight it!
ANGEL: It's <b>too hard</b>.
BUFFY: Angel, please -- just come inside.
ANGEL: It told me to kill you. You were in the dream, you know -- it told me to take you, to lose my soul in you and become a monster again.
BUFFY: I know what it told you. Why does it matter?
ANGEL: Because I wanted to! Because I want you so badly, I want to take comfort in you and I know it'll cost me my soul and a part of me doesn't care. I'm weak. I've never been anything else. It's not the demon in me that needs killing, Buffy. It's the man.
BUFFY: You're weak. Everybody is. Everybody fails. Maybe this evil power did bring you back, but if it did it's because it needs you. And that means you can hurt it. You have the power to do real good, Angel, to make amends. But if you die now, then all you ever were was a monster.
BUFFY: Angel... the sun is coming out...
ANGEL: Just go.
BUFFY: I won't.
ANGEL: You think this is simple. You think there's an answer. You can never understand what I've done. Now go!
BUFFY: You're not staying here! I won't let you --
ANGEL: Leave!
ANGEL: (bitterly) Am I a thing worth saving? Am I a righteous man? <b>The world wants  me gone</b>.
BUFFY: <b>What about me</b>? What about -  Angel I love you so much -- (sobbing) -- and I've tried to make you go away, I <b>killed</b> you and it didn't help...
BUFFY: And I hate it. I hate that it's so hard... that you can hurt me so much... I know everything you've  done because you did it to me. I  wish I wished you dead. But I don't.  I can't.
ANGEL: Buffy, please... just this once... let me be strong.
BUFFY: Strong is fighting. It's hard and it's painful and it's every day. It's what we have to do and we can do it together, but if you're too much of a coward for that then burn.
ANGEL: Buffy --
BUFFY: Let the sun kill you! If I can't  convince you you have a place in the world, then I don't know what will. So die. But don't expect me to  watch, and don't expect me to mourn for you, 'cause, I don't have... I...
GUY: Oh, man! It's gonna get the snow all wet!
WEATHERMAN: And while most of southern California is enjoying a balmy Christmas, an extreme cold front has sprung up -- out of nowhere -- around Sunnydale, where they are reporting heavy snowfall for the first time in... well, ever. Sunnydale residents shouldn't expect to see the sun at  all today, that cold front isn't going anywhere. Temperatures in the high thirties mean you'd better bundle up if you're planning to go outside and enjoy the change in the weather...
