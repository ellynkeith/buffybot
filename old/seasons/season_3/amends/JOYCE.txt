Ooh! Do you want to get one with snow on it? That'd be very Christmassy.
Oh. (as they walk) You know, honey. I was thinking -- maybe we should invite Faith to spend Christmas Eve with us.
Well, now, honey, you're both slayers, and she doesn't have any family here. Do you really want to let her spend Christmas Eve all by herself in that dingy little motel room?
I try.
You're a dear.
(quickly) No I'm sure he's fine.
He doesn't want to spend Christmas Eve with a bunch of girls. Let's split up.
Oh, come on, it's lovely. (beat) Maybe I should turn on the air conditioning.
So, Angel's on top again?
Angel? Or star.
Are you okay, honey? You've got faraway face.
Is it a slaying thing?
Faith, you made it! (re: gifts) That is so thoughtful.
(to Faith) Would you like some nog?
