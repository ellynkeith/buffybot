Oh!
Hi.
So, are you... shopping? You're probably not shopping.
Vampires probably not that big on Christmas, now I'm thinking about it...
But you're doing okay.
Yeah! I'm good. Just, uh, getting some presents for the gang. I  should probably hurry, I gotta get  to the magic shop... Angel?
Angel?
What is it?
And then he just bailed. Didn't say anything; just took off. It was weird.
No... I don't want to bug Giles. He's still pretty twitchy about the subject of Angel.
Xander, enough. Okay?
It's just so aggravating. I'm  trying to do the right thing, stay away from him, get over it and then... boom. There he is. I just want a nice quiet Christmas vacation.
(shaking her head) Tree. Nog. Roast beast. Just me and Mom and hopefully an excess  of gifts. (to Willow) What are you doing for Christmas?
(smiling) Sorry. For <b>vacation</b>.
That sounds fun.
I hear that helps.
She certainly has reverted to form.
You're right.
I think those are just for display.
I don't know, Mom. Faith and I don't really hang out, or talk, or make eye contact lately.
You're still number one with a guilt trip, Mom.
I'll ask her. Worst she can do is -- well, the worst <b>she</b> can do is serious bodily harm, but she'll probably just say no.
Hey, what about Giles? He doesn't have family here.
Well, I could ask --
No thanks.
Hey.
Nope. I just... well we're having Christmas Eve dinner at my place,  and if you didn't have plans...
No! I just thought, if you were bored -- not that it's gonna be wild fun at our house, but --
Oh, good. Cool. You know, but, if you change your mind...
I like the lights.
I was IN Angel's dream.
There were things in that dream I  couldn't possibly know about. It was Angel's past, he was dreaming it and somehow I got sucked in. (beat) There's something wrong with him.
Is there a way for us to find out?
Well let me look too. We have to help him. (off his look) I'm not seeing him anymore. I'm trying to put all that behind me. And I'm not going to be able to as long as we're doing guest spots in each other's dreams.
So we'll help him?
(to Xander) You're sure this is how you want to spend your Christmas vacation?
(leafing through book) So it's good, right? You guys are back.
Well, he does have a point. Xander was your first love. That's... (thinking of herself) . . . that's hard to let go of. Xander has a piece of you that Oz can't touch. I guess it's just about  letting Oz know that he comes first  now.
Oh. I read that one already. (closes her own book) We're not getting any closer...
The First? The first what?
So it's evil. Which is bad.
Hey.
Him. In my dream. I fell asleep just now...
Yes.
Let's not get sidetracked. Who are these guys?
These guys are working the mojo  on Angel.
But I can fight these priest guys.
Xander, you busy tomorrow?
Well, it's Christmas. Time to look up old friends.
How you been, Willy?
Have you ever heard of something called the First? Kind of an all powerful dark power sort of thingie?
Maybe you shouldn't help.
All right. Three priests. They call them the uh...
The Bringers, the Harbingers...  They sort of have a "no eyes" kind  of look...
They would have come to town recently, they'd be holed up somewhere, summoning a spirit of  the First.
You understand that I'm planning to skip the threatening portion of this exchange.
Underground where?
All right. Thanks.
Come on.
A nice cool waste of time.
In a town with fourteen million square miles of sewer --
(frustrated) I don't know what to do.
Yeah, Mom'll be looking for me.
Thanks, by the way.
Oh, yes, nothing like a roaring fire to keep away the blistering heat.
(panicked) What?
Oh. Star. Star.
I'm okay.
Hi...
(warmly) I'm glad you came.
Well, come in from the entire lack of cold.
Let me get mine, hold on.
You're not allowed to touch yours, Mom, 'cause you'll know what it is right away --
Angel.
What is it?
Angel, stay calm. Just tell me what's going on.
You came to see me to tell me I can't see you.
Angel, something is doing this to  you. You just have to control it. I know you're confused...
Angel, please... how can I help  you?
I need you to stay here with Mom. In case he comes back.
I'll explain later. Everything, I promise.
Giles, we gotta do something. Soon. Now.
Find these high priest guys. Find me SOMETHING I can pummel.
Giles, he's slipping. He's... I think we're losing him.
"and the child shall be born of goat and man, and will have two heads, the first shall speak in riddles..." (dumping it and grabbing another) No wonder you love these things. It's like reading the Star.
What? Priests?
Let me see that.
". . . the harbingers of death, nothing shall grow above or below..."
All right. Ten more minutes of chanting then you have to go to bed.
You won't get Angel.
I <b>get it. <u>You're evil</u></b>. do we have to chat about it all day?
No.
Let me guess... is it <b>evil</b>?
Angel!
Angel?
Angel, you have to come inside.
Angel, I need you to get inside. There's only a few minutes left --
I don't have time to explain this. You have to trust me; that thing that was haunting you --
Showing you --
<b>Were</b>.
You don't know. What, some great honking evil takes credit for bringing you back and you buy it? You just give up?
Then you fight it!
Angel, please -- just come inside.
I know what it told you. Why does it matter?
You're weak. Everybody is. Everybody fails. Maybe this evil power did bring you back, but if it did it's because it needs you. And that means you can hurt it. You have the power to do real good, Angel, to make amends. But if you die now, then all you ever were was a monster.
Angel... the sun is coming out...
I won't.
You're not staying here! I won't let you --
<b>What about me</b>? What about -  Angel I love you so much -- (sobbing) -- and I've tried to make you go away, I <b>killed</b> you and it didn't help...
And I hate it. I hate that it's so hard... that you can hurt me so much... I know everything you've  done because you did it to me. I  wish I wished you dead. But I don't.  I can't.
Strong is fighting. It's hard and it's painful and it's every day. It's what we have to do and we can do it together, but if you're too much of a coward for that then burn.
Let the sun kill you! If I can't  convince you you have a place in the world, then I don't know what will. So die. But don't expect me to  watch, and don't expect me to mourn for you, 'cause, I don't have... I...
