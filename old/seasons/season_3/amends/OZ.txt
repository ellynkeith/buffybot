Hey.
Okay. The thing is... seeing you with Xander, it was... Well, I never felt that way before -- when there wasn't a full moon. But I've thought about it a lot. And I know you guys have a history.
I don't know. I don't know if it ever will be, with you two.
This is what I do know. I miss you. Every second. It's like I've lost an arm. Worse. A torso. So I'm  thinking I'd be willing to give it a shot.
Yeah.
I'm good for that.
Hey. Will? It's me, I got some...
. . . videos...
You ever have that dream that you're in a play, and it's the middle of the play, and you really don't know your lines, and you kind of don't know the plot... ?
How special are we talking?
Not going. Dramatic gesture. That's pretty special.
I think we should sit again.
Okay, well, don't take this the  wrong way, but I'm not.
I have. But this is different. You look great, and you got the Barry working for you, and it's all good, but... when it happens, it should be 'cause we both need it to. For the same reason. You don't have to  prove anything to me.
I know. I get the message.
Not just yet.
