Trouble sleeping?
I'm always here.
I can't. You won't let me.
I'm a part of you now. You've taken me in.
I want to die in bed, surrounded by fat grandchildren, but I guess that's off the menu.
You're sorry? For what? For me? Don't bother. I'm dead; I'm over it. If you want to feel sorry for someone, feel sorry for yourself. Or, well, I think you've got that covered.
I don't want to make you feel bad.
It wasn't you?
Oh, yes. And what man you were!
Angel... I don't want to hurt you. But you have to understand. Cruelty is the only thing you ever had a true talent for.
Rest... rest...
You mistake it for a curse. Angel, it's not. It's your destiny. I'll show you.
I'll show you...
You want her.
Take her. Take what you want.  Pour all that frustration, all that  guilt into her and you'll be free.
You can't live for eternity with all that pain. This is what you are. This is why we brought you back. Take her. And then you'll be ready to kill her.
She wants you to touch her. What  are you waiting for?
She wants you to taste her. Think of the peace... you would never see us again.
You have to do it. What else are  you good for?
Couldn't you feel her? Couldn't you smell her skin? You're not a  fighter, Angel, don't start trying now. Sooner or later you will drink her.
You were born to hurt her. Have  you learned nothing? As long as  you're alive --
You haven't the strength to kill yourself.
You're not supposed to die! This isn't the plan!
But it'll do.
I'm impressed.
You think you can fight me. I'm not a demon, little girl. I'm something you can't conceive. The first evil. Beyond sin, beyond death... I am  the thing the darkness fears. You  will never see me, but I am  everywhere. Every being, every  thought, every drop of hate --
Angel will be dead by sunrise. Your Christmas will be his wake.
You have no idea what you're  dealing with.
