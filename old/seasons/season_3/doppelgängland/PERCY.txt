Hey, I'm challenged.
What are you talking about?
Snyder said you were gonna do it.
What meeting were you in?
I don't have time at lunch. I have to hang out.
What, you got something better to do? Just type it up and put my name on it. And don't type too good. Dead giveaway.
Hey!
Rosenberg? What are you doing? Trick-or-treating?
You're supposed to be at home doing my history report. I flunk that class you're gonna be in big trouble with Snyder. Till we graduate, I OWN your ass.
(stunned) Okay. Sure.
Hey, Uh, hi.
Okay, so I did the outline for the paper on Roosevelt -- (hands it to her) -- but, uh, it turns out there was two president Roosevelts and I didn't know exactly, uh, which I was supposed to do, so I did both -- (hands her another) I know they're kind of short but I can flesh 'em out, here's my bibliography, (hands it to her) I can retype that if, uh... So just let me know what I did wrong, and, and, I'll get on that.
