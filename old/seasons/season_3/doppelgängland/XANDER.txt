Willow! Did you remember to tape Biography last friday?
She just meant, you know, the geyser. You're like a geyser of fun that goes off at regular intervals.
Isn't that the dog that the guy has to shoot --
I'm thinking nervestrike.
What's going on? Is there a funny thing?
Whoah!
Back off! You stay the hell away from her!
Will. Changing the look not an idle threat with you.
Uh, Will, this is verging on naughty touching here. We don't want to fall back on bad habits -- Hands! Hands in new places.
You mentioned that earlier. Will, are you okay?
(eyes on Will) Hey, Buff.
Willow, I gotta say I'm not loving the new you.
This isn't real.
Way better than me...
It's all my fault.
I don't know... Statistical probability...
Back! Get back, Demon!
Will, we saw you. At the bronze. A vampire.
Can you believe the Watcher council let this guy go?
Not looks like -- is.
Did anybody else just go to scary visual place?
We're right there with you, Buddy.
Here here.
What do we do now?
So we charge in, much in the style of John Wayne?
What is the signal?
So, in your reality I'm like this bad ass vampire, huh? People afraid of me?
Oh yeah. I'm bad.
