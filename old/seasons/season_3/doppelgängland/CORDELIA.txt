Hello, Giles? (smaller, more hopeful voice) Wesley? (fixing her hair) I just happened to stop by... for books...
Hey me? Hey me what? I have a name, you know.
What'd you do? Lock yourself in the book cage?
Okay.
I think Giles keeps a spare -- yeah. How'd you manage to lock yourself in, anyway?
Yeah, right. The famous shy girl act all the boys fall for.
Wait a minute.
It occurs to me that we've never really had the opportunity to talk. You know, woman to woman, with you locked up.
What could we talk about? Hey, how about the ethics of boyfriend stealing?
And, okay, it isn't even like I was that attracted to Xander, it was more just that we kept being in these life or death situations and that's always all sexy and stuff. I mean I more or less knew he was a loser but that doesn't make it okay for you to come around and -- what? Do I have something on my neck?
(trying to look) Am I getting a zit?
Like you could.
I <b>should</b> just leave you in there. But I am a great humanitarian and you'll just have to think of a way to pay me back sometime.
I didn't mean all that stuff I said before. I want you to have Xander. My blessings on you both...
I'm sorry...
You saved my life.
Oh, thank you!
Willow. (genuine sadness) They got Willow. (over it) So, you doing anything tonight?
