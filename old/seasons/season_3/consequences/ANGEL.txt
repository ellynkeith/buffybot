Buffy. I've been looking for you. (sees her hand) Your hand!
I'm sorry about the chains. It's not that I don't trust you- (then) Actually. It is that I don't trust you.
And he forgot the safety word? That it?
I bet you're not big on trust games, are you, Faith?
I just want to talk to you.
You wanna go the long way 'round, I can do that.
I'm not getting any older.
Like talking to a wall. Only you get more from a wall.
Sure. We're just getting started.
(gently) Right now there's nothing you can do.
It's not a bad idea.
I just... Don't get your hopes up, Buffy. She may not want our help.
She killed a man. That changes everything for her.
That's not what I mean. She's taken a life.
She's got a taste for it, now.
But I know. What it's like, to take a life. To feel a future, a world of possibility - snuffed out by your own hand. I know the power in it. The exhilaration. It was like a drug for me.
A professional couldn't have helped me. It stopped when I got my soul back. My human heart.
Faith. You have a choice. You've tasted something few ever do. To kill without remorse is to feel like a God-
(ignoring) But you're not a God. You're not much more than a child. And this path will ruin you. You can't imagine the price for true evil.
You and me, Faith, we're a lot alike.
Like I said. A lot alike.
You're not alive. You're just running. Afraid to feel. Afraid to be touched...
Time was, I thought humans existed just to hurt each other.
But then I came here. And I found out that there were other kinds of people. People who genuinely wanted to do right. They still make mistakes. They fall down. But they keep trying. Keep caring.
If you can trust us, Faith, it can all change. You don't have to disappear into the darkness.
No!
Leave her! You can't help her!
I'm fine. They took Faith-
The new watcher. He had a couple of guys helping him.
Good work. First you terrorize her, then you put her back on the streets-
I'll try the airport.
