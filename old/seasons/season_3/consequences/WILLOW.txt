Hey... Where's Faith? I saw her around. Figured you guys were off to kill more nasty stuff.
Actually, I should get-
I'm - late.
I'm meeting Michael, the warlock guy? We're still trying to "de-rat" Amy.
So. See you.
Hey...
Good. 'Cause I've been letting things fester. And I don't like it. I want to be fester-free.
(anxious/interrupting) I mean, don't get me wrong. I understand why you and Faith have been doing the bonding thing. You work together - you should get along.
But, see? It's that exact thing that's ticking me off. This whole "slayer's only" attitude. Since when wouldn't I understand? You talk to me about everything! It's like - all of the sudden I'm not cool enough for you because I can't kill things with my bare hands!
Oh! Oh, Buffy. Don't cry. I'm sorry. I was too hard on you. Sometimes I unleash... and I don't know my own strength. It's bad. (off Buffy's continued tears) I'm bad. I'm a bad, bad person.
You think she's like, in shock?
You have to go to Giles, Buffy. He'll know what to do.
Maybe we should all talk to Faith together.
I don't need to say "oh." I got it before. They slept together.
What? Oh. Sure. I can try.
Then he figured it out. The murder-
Can I- I'm just wondering. Why?
I'm not the most objective, I know. I kinda have an issue with Faith sharing my ... people. (then) But - she murdered someone and accused Buffy. Then she hurt Xander. I hate to say it, but maybe she belongs behind bars.
