So you heard the man scream about what time last night?
Can you be more specific? Say, between seven and seven thirty?
Tell me again. You got home at what time last night?
Maybe you can explain to me what a girl your age is doing out all night.
Hanging? By yourself?
What did you watch?
That's funny. 'Cause I've got a couple witnesses who put you near the alley.
(nods) Somebody stabbed this guy through the heart. Strange thing is, the weapon? It was made outta wood. (then) Any of this mean anything to you?
I have enough for now. (then) Buffy. If you know something. If you're protecting someone...
...I promise you it'll be better for everyone if you come clean.
Well. Call me if you "remember" anything.
