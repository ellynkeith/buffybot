It's no big, B. We can get into it if he wants-
New watcher.
First word, "jail," second word, "bait."
Yep. Off to patrol. See ya.
Fine by me. Always ready to kick a little bad guy butt.
You gonna rat me out? Is that it?
Oh. I see. You can "pretend" that Angel's still dead when you need to protect him-
Worse than jail for the rest of my young life? No way.
Yeah. We. You were right there beside me when this thing went down. Anything I have to answer for - you do too. You're part of this, B. All the way.
I'm telling you. We did the world a favor. This guy was about as interesting as watching paint dry.
Joking. Geez, lighten up, B...
He came out of nowhere.
Whatever. I'm not looking to hug and cry and learn and grow. I'm just saying it went down quick, is all.
Let's just blow. I mean, who cares what this guy was about? It's kind of moot now - don't you think?
(scoffing) So, what, you think there's some big conspiracy-
So his papers are gone. That doesn't prove anything.
(wry) So the mayor of Sunnydale is a black hat. Shocker, huh?
When you gonna learn, B? It doesn't matter what kind of "vibe" a person gives off. Nine times outta ten the face they're showing you? It isn't the real one.
What's that supposed to mean?
(dubious) Do you? So, fill me in. I'd like to hear this.
(cutting her off/unmoved) Is there gonna be an intermission in this?
No way. We're not bringing anybody else into this. You gotta keep your head, B. This is all going to blow over in a few days.
If it doesn't... They got a freighter leaving the docks at least twice a day. It's not fancy - but it gets you gone.
Buffy. I'm not going to "see" anything... I missed the mark last night. And I'm sorry about the guy, really. But it happens. (then) Anyway - how many people do you think we've saved by now? Thousands? And didn't you stop the world from ending? In my book, that puts you and me firmly in the plus column.
Why not? This guy I offed was no Ghandi. We just saw - he was mixed up in dirty dealing.
What if he was? You're still not looking at the big picture, B. Something made us different. We're warriors. We were built to kill-
We are better. (this stop Buffy) That's right. Better. People need us to survive. In the balance? Nobody's gonna cry over some random bystander who got caught in the crossfire.
Your loss.
Just hanging.
No. I was with my friend Buffy.
Some old movie.
Witnesses?
Yeah. Whoever did it wasn't hip to the bronze age.
You mean, am I covering for someone? Hardly. I'm not the "throw myself on the sword" type.
It's okay, Buffy. I told him.
Had to. He had to know what you did.
I'm... sorry.
What?
Sick of people asking me that, for one thing.
Like you could make something happen if I didn't want it to.
Five minutes.
Clock is running.
So talk to Buffy. She's the one who killed a guy.
(hard) Version?
No. The important part is - Buffy's the "accidental" murderer.
You're living proof of that, huh?
You'd dig that, wouldn't you? To get up in front of all your geek pals and go on record about how I made you my boy toy for a night-
That's what this is all about, isn't it? You just came here because you want another taste.
Then like how? Lights on or off? Kinks or vanilla?
You want to feel our connection?
It's just skin.
I see. I want. I take. (then/hard) I forget.
I could do anything to you right now. And you want me to.
I could make you scream.
I could make you die.
Finally decided to tie me up, huh? Always knew you weren't really a one slayer guy.
That thing with Xander? I know what it looked like, but we were just playing-
Safety words are for wusses.
(scoffing) You gonna shrink me now, that it?
That's what they all say. Then it's - "just let me stay the night. I won't try anything."
Join the club. Everybody seems to have a theory.
Yeah? Sounds like you need some help. A professional, maybe.
Goody for you. (then) If we're going to party, let's get on with it. otherwise, could you let me out of these things?
Right now - all I feel is a cramp in my wrist. Let me go!
Yeah? I hope evil takes Mastercard.
Well, you're kind of dead...
Sorry, buddy. I'm alive and kicking. In fact, I've got a bodily function that needs attending to pretty quick here.
Save it for Hallmark. I have to pee.
Whatever.
(to Wesley) Have to disagree with you on that one.
Now unlock me, or I'll pop this guy's head like a grape.
Don't even think about it.
Wrong again, Wes.
Yeah. 'Cause you and me are such solid buds.
For me to change and be like you, You mean? Little miss goody two shoes? Ain't gonna happen, B.
It scares you, doesn't it?
But that's not it. That's not what bothers you so much. What bugs you is - you know I'm right. You know in your gut. We don't need the law. We are the law-
Yes. You know exactly what I'm about. Because you have it in you, too.
I've seen it, B. You've got the lust. And I'm not just talking about screwing vampires-
It was good, wasn't it? The sex? The danger? Bet a part of you even dug him when he went psycho-
See - you need me to tow the line because you're afraid you'll go over it, aren't you, B? You can't handle watching me living my own way and having a blast - because it tempts you. You know it could be you-
(taunting) There's my girl...
Why not? It feels good. Blood rising-
You sent your boy to kill me.
He's dust.
Guess that means you have a job opening.
