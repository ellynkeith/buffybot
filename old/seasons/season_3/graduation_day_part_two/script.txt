HENCHMAN: There's nobody here, sir.
MAYOR: No. No, she'd take the fight outside.  My Faith doesn't like to be cooped up.
HENCHMAN: But sir, the Ascension is --
MAYOR: FIND THEM!
XANDER: Any word from Buffy?
GILES: Not yet.
XANDER: Here's your coffee. Brewed from the  finest Colombian lighter fluid.
GILES: Thank you.
XANDER: Aren't you supposed to be drinking  tea, anyway?
GILES: Tea is soothing. I wish to be tense.
XANDER: Okay, but you're destroying a perfectly  good cultural stereotype here...
GILES: Look through the Kippler volumes.  Any reference to the Demon Olvikan...  powers, weaknesses, hat size... there's  got to be something.
XANDER: You still battin' zero? But, I mean,  in cricket?
GILES: So far. But don't give up.
XANDER: Cordy. Wassup?
CORDELIA: I demand an explanation.
XANDER: For what?
CORDELIA: Wesley!
XANDER: Uh... inbreeding?
CORDELIA: So very funny. Any minute now I'm  sure to laugh. (to Giles) I just got off the phone with him.  He could hardy speak, he was so upset.  He said there'd been a fight, or  something and- (to Xander) TAHAHA what a witty comment- (to Giles, never missing a beat) -he said he was leaving the country.
GILES: Shall I assay remorse?
CORDELIA: Just tell me what's going on.
GILES: Buffy has quit the Council. She'll not be  working with Wesley from now on.
CORDELIA: But he's her watcher!
GILES: Buffy no longer needs a watcher.
CORDELIA: Well, does he have to leave the country?  I mean, you got fired and you hang  around like a big loser, why can't he?
XANDER: Cordelia!
CORDELIA: Sure.
WILLOW: You're awake.
ANGEL: You've been watching over me?
WILLOW: Well, we've been taking turns...
ANGEL: I thought I'd never... see you again.  I can't leave you. I was wrong... I  need you.
WILLOW: Oh. You mean you need Buffy?
ANGEL: Willow.
WILLOW: Yes! Right. Good.
ANGEL: Where is she?
WILLOW: She'll be back soon...
OZ: Any change?
WILLOW: He's delirious. He thought I was Buffy.
OZ: You too, huh?
WILLOW: I hope she comes soon. I mean, she'd  better, if...
OZ: Yeah.
WILLOW: I feel so... I feel so guilty.
OZ: Guilty?
WILLOW: Well, things are just so terrible,  everything's coming apart, and I'm  just... in some ways it's the best night  of my life.
OZ: The best?
WILLOW: The best.
OZ: Did you find Faith?
WILLOW: You didn't... she's not here?
BUFFY: (shakes her head) How is he?
OZ: Comes in and out... I think the pain  is... less, now.
BUFFY: Why don't you guys... I'd like to be  with him.
OZ: Of course.
WILLOW: We can keep looking for another cure.
BUFFY: Thanks.
ANGEL: Buffy... It's you?
BUFFY: It's me.
ANGEL: I didn't want to go without... seeing you...
BUFFY: Angel, I can cure you.
ANGEL: It's okay... I'm ready...
BUFFY: Angel, listen to me. Sit up.
ANGEL: What do I--
BUFFY: Drink.
ANGEL: No.
BUFFY: It's the only --
ANGEL: Get away!
BUFFY: It'll save you.
ANGEL: It'll kill you.
BUFFY: Maybe not, if you don't take all...
ANGEL: You can't ask me to do this.
BUFFY: I won't let you die. I can't. The blood  of the Slayer is the only cure.
ANGEL: Faith...
BUFFY: I tried to... I killed her.
ANGEL: Then it's over.
BUFFY: No.  She moves to him. He shoves her aside and exits.
ANGEL: It's over!
BUFFY: It's never over. I won't let you die. Drink.
ANGEL: Please...
ANGEL: I need help!
NURSE: What happened?
ANGEL: She needs blood!
NURSE: Try to stay calm.
ANGEL: Something bit her. She needs a transfusion  right now.
POWELL: You found her?
ANGEL: Yes.
POWELL: Was she conscious?
ANGEL: Yes.
POWELL: Are you sure?
ANGEL: I'm sure.  POWELL (to the nurse) I need a type and cross match. Get her  on two lines of ringers lactate and watch  for hypovalemic shock.
ANGEL: Something bit her. I don't know what.
POWELL: (to the nurse) I'll need a rabies shot treatment. (to Angel) Any allergies?
ANGEL: None. Just help her!
POWELL: You two been doing drugs?
ANGEL: She's clean.
POWELL: All right. Wait outside. Let us work.
ANGEL: A phone.
POWELL: Right out there.
GOLD: The bones will set, and the damage to her  kidney is repairable, but... The head trauma  is simply too severe. It's a wonder she's alive  at all, with the blood loss. I'm sorry, sir,  there's almost no chance she'll ever regain  consciousness.
MAYOR: It's your day...
NURSE: We have another young girl, severe blood  loss, Dr. Powell wants you to prep to assist  on an anticubital cut down.
GOLD: All right.
NURSE: Oh my god! Sir, no!
ANGEL: Don't do that.
MAYOR: I will. I'll do that and worse. Murderous  little fiend, did you see what she did to  my Faith?
ANGEL: Hadn't made plans to weep over that one.
MAYOR: Well, I'd get set for some weeping if I  were you. I'd get set for a world of hurt.  Misery loves company, young man, and  I'll be looking to share mine with you  and your whore.
ANGEL: I'll be there.
GILES: How is she?
ANGEL: She's fine. She's sleeping.
OZ: You seem all right too.
ANGEL: Yeah.
XANDER: So what happened?
WILLOW: We left her, she was fine? Did Faith --
ANGEL: Faith's out of the picture. Buffy put her in a coma.
XANDER: And...
ANGEL: Buffy cured me... made me...
GILES: You fed off her.
ANGEL: Yes.
GILES: How much?
ANGEL: She's gonna be fine.
XANDER: Well, it's just good to know that when  the chips are down and things look grim,  you'll feed off the girl who loves you to  save your own ass.
GILES: You'd best go, Angel. We can watch  over her.
ANGEL: I don't want to --
GILES: The sun'll be up soon.
XANDER: Gosh I'm gonna miss him when he  leaves town.
GILES: Let's see how Buffy's doing.
BUFFY: Who's gonna look after him?
FAITH: It's a she. And aren't these things supposed  to take care of themselves?
BUFFY: A higher power, guiding us?
FAITH: I'm pretty sure that's not what I meant.
BUFFY: There's something I'm supposed to  be doing.
FAITH: Oh yeah. Miles to go. Little Miss Muffet  counting down from seven three oh.
BUFFY: Oh, great. Riddles.
FAITH: Sorry. It's my head. Lotta new stuff.
BUFFY: What about you?
FAITH: Scar tissue. It fades, it all fades.
BUFFY: Is this your mind or mine?
FAITH: Beats me. (a beat) Gettin' towards that time.
BUFFY: How are you gonna fit all this stuff?
FAITH: Not gonna. It's yours.
BUFFY: I can't use all this.
FAITH: Just take what you need.
WILLOW: Buffy!
XANDER: Are you okay?
GILES: How do you feel?
BUFFY: Where's Angel?
OZ: He had to leave. Got kind of sunny.
BUFFY: Get him. Get everyone.
XANDER: What exactly is up?
GILES: Buffy, are you sure you're all right?
BUFFY: (nods) I'm ready.
WILLOW: Ready for what?
BUFFY: War.
TWO: 
BUFFY: That's the basic plan. So. Am I crazy?
WILLOW: Well, "crazy's" a strong word --
GILES: Let's not rule it out though.
BUFFY: (to Giles) You don't think it can be done.
GILES: I didn't say that. I might, but I haven't yet.
CORDELIA: Okay, well, I personally don't think it's  possible to come up with a crazier plan.
OZ: We attack the Mayor with hummus.
CORDELIA: I stand corrected.
OZ: Just keeping things in perspective.
CORDELIA: Thank you. My point, however, is crazy  or not, it's pretty much the only plan.  Besides, it's Buffy's and she's slay-gal,  you know. Miss Like-to-Fight, so...
XANDER: I think there was a 'yea' vote buried  in there somewhere.
BUFFY: Well, I need you all on board. Especially  you, Xander. You're kind of the key to  this figure here.
XANDER: Key? Me? Okay, pride... humility...  and here's the mind numbing fear.  What do I have to do?
BUFFY: Do you still remember any of your  military training from when you became  soldier guy?
XANDER: Ooh! Rocket launcher?
BUFFY: Rocket launcher's not gonna get it done.  Took a volcano to kill one of these things  last time.
GILES: Buffy, all of this is dependant on your  being able to control the Mayor. How  do you plan to do that?
BUFFY: Faith told me I'd have to play on his  human weakness. That's the way I'm  gonna get to him.
WILLOW: Faith told you? Was that before or after  you put her in a coma?
BUFFY: After.
WILLOW: Oh.
GILES: The Mayor's weakness.
BUFFY: Right.
GILES: Which is what?
BUFFY: (defensively) You know, I do all his planning, I'm in  charge even though I'm not feeling my  best, and now I'm supposed to come up  with every little detail...
GILES: Well, let us think.
OZ: Angel, you hung out with him the most.  Is he afraid of something?
ANGEL: Well, he's not crazy about germs --
CORDELIA: Of course! That's it! We attack him  with germs!
BUFFY: Great. We'll get him cornered and then  you sneeze on him.
CORDELIA: No no, we get a canister of ebola virus,  and and, or it doesn't have to be real,  we could just have a box that says "ebola"  on it, and we could chase him... with the box...
XANDER: Okay, I'm starting to lean towards the  hummus offensive.
OZ: He'll never see it coming...
ANGEL: Faith.
BUFFY: Faith. You think?
ANGEL: At the hospital, he was grieving.  Seriously crazed, and not just in a  homicidal, I-wanna-be-a-demon way.  She's his weak link.
BUFFY: (wheels turning) Okay. Good. I can work that.
WESLEY: You haven't an enormous amount of time.
XANDER: Hey, it's Mister States-the-Obvious!
BUFFY: The Council isn't welcome here. I got  no time for orders. I need someone to  scream like a woman, I'll give you a call.
WESLEY: I'm not here for the Council. Just tell  me how I can help.
CORDELIA: Oh, you are SO classy. Isn't he  just so classy?
BUFFY: (pleased) It's a start.
WESLEY: So there is something I can do? Besides  scream like a woman?
BUFFY: There's plenty. Chores for everyone.  Okay, this is how it's going to lay out...
MAYOR: This is how it's going to lay out. The  transformation should begin at exactly  three-twenty-eight. I'll just be finishing  my speech -- you know it's too bad you  fellas are gonna have to miss that.  'Cause I think it speaks to every one  of us... I mean, heck - I've been working  on it for a hundred years, it better be good.  Well. They'll try to run, of course, and that's  when I need you boys in flanking position.
VAMP: Sir, the sun.
MAYOR: Not a problem.
WESLEY: "Darkness will follow, the day become night..."
BUFFY: An eclipse.
WESLEY: Standard procedure during an Ascension.
ANGEL: That puts me back in the game.
BUFFY: Yes it does. I'll need you and Xander  working in sync here. Can you guys  handle that?
XANDER: I'm still Key Guy, right?
BUFFY: Right.
XANDER: Great, then Angel -- in his non-Key  Guy capacity -- can work with me.
ANGEL: What fun.
XANDER: Hey, Key Guy's talking...
BUFFY: Oh, good, let's bicker! That'll work great. (off their shame) You're like little old ladies.
MAYOR: You'll come up through the sewers here.  The important thing is containment. I'll  need to feed, it's crucial in the first few  minutes, to sustain the change. What  does that mean? No snacking! I see  blood on your lips and it's a visit to  the woodshed for your boys. Kill.  Don't feed.
BUFFY: How are we on volcano detail?
OZ: I think we can work it.
WILLOW: Fun with chemistry.
BUFFY: Xander should be able to locate the materials.
OZ: Who's gonna stoke it up?
BUFFY: Feel up to it?
GILES: I suppose it should be I. It's fitting, in  a grotesque fashion.
BUFFY: Okay. (to the kids) You guys start reaching out.  (to Giles) Giles, weapons weapons weapons.
GILES: What about you?
BUFFY: There's something I need to get.
MAYOR: Remember, fast and brutal. Gonna be  a whole new world come nightfall,  don't wanna weaken now. And boys --
XANDER: Harmony. Listen, I need to talk to  you for a sec.
HARMONY: You mean, in front of other people?
PERCY: I'm gonna look stupid in this.
WILLOW: Percy --
PERCY: Do I look stupid in this? Be honest.
WILLOW: You look great. You got a sec?
WESLEY: Cordelia...
CORDELIA: Yes?
WESLEY: You know that... when this is over...
CORDELIA: Yes?
WESLEY: Well, should we prevail, I... I'll be  returning back to England.
CORDELIA: (crest fallen) I know.
WESLEY: With Buffy no longer working for the  Council, there's really no place for me here.
CORDELIA: I guess not.
WESLEY: No reason to stay...
CORDELIA: No...
WESLEY: No cause to hope... That I might be needed...
CORDELIA: Needed...
WESLEY: Or wanted...
CORDELIA: Wanted...
WESLEY: Yes, thanks. I'll drop a line sometime.
CORDELIA: That'd be neat.
OZ: Put these with the others. And don't  touch anything.
LARRY: We got it.
JONATHAN: What do we do then?
OZ: Nothing.
WILLOW: Just relax, have a good time.
JONATHAN: (nervously) Uh, okay...
LARRY: It's clear. Let's move.
WILLOW: I guess that's it. Won't be long now.
OZ: Nervous?
WILLOW: Only in a terrified way.
OZ: We'll make it through this.
WILLOW: Are you sure?
OZ: I should pretty sure, don't I?
WILLOW: Yeah...
OZ: Then I must be sure.
WILLOW: Was that just a comforting way of not  answering the question?
OZ: Little while...
ANGEL: You get what you needed?
BUFFY: I did.
ANGEL: Giles is on it.
BUFFY: I heal fast. Like you. Have you and  Xander worked out your timing?
ANGEL: I'm not saying goodbye.
SNYDER: Congratulations to the class of 1999.  You've all proved more or less adequate.  This is a time for celebration, so sit  still and be quiet.  (to one student) Spit out that gum.  (to the class) Please welcome our distinguished guest  speaker, Sunnydale's own Mayor, Richard Wilkins III. (to the same student) I saw that gesture. You see me after  graduation.
WILLOW: Am I late? Did we fight?
MAYOR: Well. What a day this is. Special day.  Today is our centennial, the one hundredth  anniversary of the founding of Sunnydale.  And I know what that means to all you  kids. Not a darn thing. 'Cause today  something much more important happens.  Today you all graduate from high school.  Today all the pain and the work and the  excitement is finally over, and what's  a hundred years of history compared  to that?
BUFFY: My god... he's gonna do the whole speech.
WILLOW: Oh, man... just ascend, already!
BUFFY: Evil.
MAYOR: But you know what, kids? Maybe the  two things are connected. Maybe you  have a place in Sunnydale's history,  whether you like it or not. It's been a  long road getting here, for you, for  Sunnydale... there's been achievement,  joy, good times... and there's been grief.  There's been loss. Some people who  should be here today, aren't.
MAYOR: So as we look back on...
BUFFY: Come on...
MAYOR: We must all... AHH. It has begun.  My destiny. Little sooner than I expected -- (re: 3x5's) --I had a whole section about civic  pride, but...
SNYDER: This is simply unacceptable.
BUFFY: NOW!
XANDER: First wave!
OZ: Xander!
XANDER: Bowmen!
LARRY: Dammit!
BUFFY: Fall back!
SNYDER: This is not orderly. This is not disciplined. (to the Mayor) You're on MY campus, buddy, and  when I saw I want quiet--
BUFFY: (to the students) Fall back! Get back! (to Willow) Go.
WILLOW: Good luck.
BUFFY: Xander! Take 'em down.
XANDER: Everyone! Hand to hand!
VAMP: Get the kids!
XANDER: Right flank! Close on them! Close! (to students, peeved) Jason, Doug, you guys are the right flank!
BUFFY: Hey!
WESLEY: If I could just get something for the  pain, it's rather a lot of pain... an  aspirin.. anyone... if I could just be  knocked unconscious...
XANDER: We got off pretty cheap, considering.
BUFFY: Seems like we did.
XANDER: He made it through the fight. Guess  maybe he took off after.
GILES: How are you?
BUFFY: Tired.
GILES: I'd imagine so. Quite a couple of days.
BUFFY: My brain hasn't processed everything yet.  It's not really functioning at the higher  levels; it's pretty much, "fire bad, tree  pretty". Anything more complex...
GILES: Understandable. Well, when it starts  working again, congratulate it on a  good campaign. You did very well.
BUFFY: Thanks.
GILES: (reaching into his pocket) I uh, I ferreted this out of the wreckage  for you. You may not have any interest, but...
BUFFY: Fire bad. Tree pretty.
GILES: Right. Sorry. I'd best check on Wesley,  see if he's still whimpering.
CORDELIA: Well, that was the most fun you can  have without having any fun.
WILLOW: What about the part where we kicked  demon ass? I didn't hate that.
XANDER: Guys, we blew up the school! It's the  best day ever!
WILLOW: Why do demons even come here anymore?  Don't they know how bad we are?
BUFFY: I think we've done pretty much everything  we can. You guys wanna take off?
CORDELIA: I'm for it.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) You okay?
BUFFY: Yeah. I'm okay. I just... I could use a  little sleep.
WILLOW: Yeah.
BUFFY: If somebody could just wake me up  when it's time to go to college, that'd  be great.
OZ: Guys. Take a moment to deal with this.  We survived.
BUFFY: It was a hell of a battle.
OZ: Not that battle. High school.
XANDER: You know what the best part of high  school was?
BUFFY: When we blew it up?
XANDER: Yeah! That ruled. 'Cause you know the  thing that made it so special...
BUFFY: Was that the school blew up?
XANDER: Exactly!
BUFFY: I begin to find you troubling.
XANDER: Oh, come on, you know you're all  thinking it.
BUFFY: Well...
WILLOW: I was.
CORDELIA: Pretty much.
OZ: Uh huh.
BUFFY: Yeah.
