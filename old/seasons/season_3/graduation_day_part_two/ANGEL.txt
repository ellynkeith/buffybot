You've been watching over me?
I thought I'd never... see you again.  I can't leave you. I was wrong... I  need you.
Willow.
Where is she?
Buffy... It's you?
I didn't want to go without... seeing you...
It's okay... I'm ready...
What do I--
No.
Get away!
It'll kill you.
You can't ask me to do this.
Faith...
Then it's over.
It's over!
Please...
I need help!
She needs blood!
Something bit her. She needs a transfusion  right now.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm sure.  POWELL (to the nurse) I need a type and cross match. Get her  on two lines of ringers lactate and watch  for hypovalemic shock.
Something bit her. I don't know what.
None. Just help her!
She's clean.
A phone.
Don't do that.
Hadn't made plans to weep over that one.
I'll be there.
She's fine. She's sleeping.
Yeah.
Faith's out of the picture. Buffy put her in a coma.
Buffy cured me... made me...
Yes.
She's gonna be fine.
I don't want to --
Well, he's not crazy about germs --
Faith.
At the hospital, he was grieving.  Seriously crazed, and not just in a  homicidal, I-wanna-be-a-demon way.  She's his weak link.
That puts me back in the game.
What fun.
You get what you needed?
Giles is on it.
I'm not saying goodbye.
