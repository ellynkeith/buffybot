Right in the heart.
I'm not sure that's the word...
No, I wasn't trying to -
Of course.
Waiting for you. I know.
Am I going to see you this weekend?  You probably have plans...
A thing? A date?
(smiles) Your father. (sudden worry) It is your father...
You really like it?
(kindly) Then why did you seem more excited last year when you got a severed arm in a box?
That's understandable.
You lived a long time without them. You can do it again.
Buffy. You couldn't be helpless or boring.  Not even if you tried.
I watched you, I saw you called. It was a bright afternoon, out in front of your school, you walked down the steps and I loved you.
Because I could see your heart. You held it before you for everyone to  see and I worried that it would be  bruised or torn. More than anything in my life I wanted to keep it safe, to warm it with my own.
I was just thinking that too.
