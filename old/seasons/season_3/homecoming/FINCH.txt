I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
(crossing to the desk) Well, I'm not sure how serious this  is, sir. But they were spotted in town three days ago. I've just been informed.
Frederick and Hans Gruenshtahler. Wanted in Germany for capital murder, terrorism, the bombing of flight 1402...
I should have brought it to your attention sooner, but I wanted to confirm...
Sir?
Of course, sir, I mean I washed them, but --
Yes, sir.
I'll take care of it.
