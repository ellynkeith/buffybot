CORDELIA: I think we should get a limo.
XANDER: A limo? A big, expensive limo?
WILLOW: That sounds like fun.
WILLOW: And it is our last Homecoming dance, maybe we should make a big deal.
XANDER: You want to talk fun? Public bus. You meet the fun-est people! Back me up here, Oz.
OZ: Well, if it's a dollar issue, we could all take my van...
CORDELIA: Van? The Homecoming Queen does not come to the dance in a van. Use your head.
XANDER: Well, technically you haven't been elected yet... (off the deadly laser that is her look) ...although you certainly and without doubt will. (to the others) Who else likes a limo?
WILLOW: A private limo... (links her arm through Oz's) ...it is pretty...cuddlesome. (to Buffy) If we all split the cost...
BUFFY: Maybe, you know, if I go and all...
WILLOW: Why wouldn't you? You bought your tickets already. I mean unless you didn't have a da -- (almost says date) -- ay or two to think it over. We should all think it over.
CORDELIA: What's going on? Scott hasn't asked  her to the Homecoming dance yet?
BUFFY: Thank you, Cordelia. The  humiliation's so good for my color.
SCOTT: Oh... (to Buffy) No, I just... I sort of assumed you'd think that was corny. But I'm in... you know, I mean if you want to.
BUFFY: I do. If you do.
SCOTT: I do. If you do.
OZ: The judges will accept that as a yes.
BUFFY: (to take attention off herself) So, Cordy, what's your strategy for winning the election? Is it safe to  say bribes are involved?
CORDELIA: Bribes are only a part of it. A year ago I would have had this thing sewn. But the public's fickle. There's competition now, not to mention my liabilities. (glances at Xander)
XANDER: Are you saying that dating me is some kind of hindrance to you bagging Homecoming Queen?
CORDELIA: Oh, sweetie... it's okay, I can overcome it, I'm that good.
XANDER: Well, all right then.
SCOTT: You want another drink?
BUFFY: You know what? I'm a little tired. Think I'll call it a night. I'm excited about the Homecoming dance.
BUFFY: See you tomorrow.
BUFFY: It's me!
BUFFY: How are you feeling?
ANGEL: It hurts... less.
BUFFY: I haven't told Giles or the others you're back...
ANGEL: (remembering) Giles...
BUFFY: I'm not going to, they wouldn't understand that you're...
BUFFY: ... better. And I'm going to help you keep getting better but... everything's different now, Angel. I'm working harder at school. I'm a  Senior now, thinking about college -- also I have a boyfriend.
BUFFY: His name is Scott. He's a good, solid guy. He makes me happy. And that's what I need. Someone I can count on.
SCOTT: I don't think we should see each other anymore.
BUFFY: You don't? But... when did this  happen? Where was I?
SCOTT: I like you, I'm just not sure where we're going...
BUFFY: Okay, it's too soon to know where we're going... but isn't it too soon to not go at all?
SCOTT: Buffy, it's just...before we were going out you seemed so full of life, like a force of nature. Now you seem kind of distracted all the time and --
BUFFY: -- no, I know I do that, because my  life is so... but I'm getting better and you're going to be seeing a drastic distraction reduction from here on out... (nothing from Scott) "Drastic reduction reduction", try saying that ten times fast.
SCOTT: I'm really sorry.
MAN: Is that her?
TRICK: In the nubile flesh, my friend.
WILLOW: You have to help me pick an outfit. I want to wear something that'll make Oz go "ooh".
XANDER: No problem. I got the tux goin' on. I'm gonna look hot if it even remotely fits.
XANDER: Whatchya doin'?
CORDELIA: Checking out the I laughingly use the phrase competition.
CORDELIA: Holy Charleston, nice girl, brain- dead, doesn't have a prayer. And  Michelle Blake, open to all mankind, especially if they have a letterman's jacket and a car -- she could give me a run.
WILLOW: Where's Buffy? She's going to miss the yearbook pictures.
XANDER: She and Faith are in the library, getting sweaty.
CORDELIA: They're training.
XANDER: I stand by my phrase.
OZ: I don't think she was here the day they announced 'em. Did anybody tell her?
CORDELIA: I'll tell her now. I've gotta go by  the Nurse's office and get an ice pack.
XANDER: Did you hurt yourself?
CORDELIA: No silly... (pats her face) ...shrinks the pores.
FAITH: Man. Guys should break up with you more often.
BUFFY: Gee. Thanks.
FAITH: I mean it. You got some quality rage going. Really gives you an edge.
BUFFY: Lucky me. Edge girl.
FAITH: Well, screw him. You move on, you party -- heavily -- you'll be fine. You're still going to that dance, right?
BUFFY: I don't know...
FAITH: You got the tix already... Why don't we go together?
BUFFY: (considering it) Well, maybe...
FAITH: Come on, we'll find a couple a studs,  use 'em and discard 'em like old hankies. That's always fun.
BUFFY: Okay. I'm in. Not the stud-using part -- or, probably not...
CORDELIA: Bobby, Mashad, you don't phone, you don't write... (head off after them) ... I miss you guys, seriously...
FINCH: I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
FINCH: (crossing to the desk) Well, I'm not sure how serious this  is, sir. But they were spotted in town three days ago. I've just been informed.
FINCH: Frederick and Hans Gruenshtahler. Wanted in Germany for capital murder, terrorism, the bombing of flight 1402...
FINCH: I should have brought it to your attention sooner, but I wanted to confirm...
MAYOR: Would you show me your hands, please?
FINCH: Sir?
MAYOR: Your hands.
MAYOR: I think they could be cleaner.
FINCH: Of course, sir, I mean I washed them, but --
MAYOR: After every meal, and under the fingernails. Dirt gets trapped  there. And germs. And mayonnaise.
FINCH: Yes, sir.
MAYOR: My dear mother said that cleanliness was next to godliness and I believed her. She never caught a cold. (closing the folder) I'd like these two to be put under surveillance. And I'd like to know  if any other colorful characters have come to town.
FINCH: I'll take care of it.
MAYOR: You have all my faith.
WILLOW: What do you think of this?
XANDER: Nice.
WILLOW: It's my first big dance, you know, where there's a boy and a band and not just me alone in my room  pretending there's a boy and a band, so I want it to be...
XANDER: ...special. Which is why I spared no expense on the tux.
WILLOW: I thought you borrowed it from your cousin Rigby.
XANDER: Expense to my pride, Will. They're our only relations with money and  they shun us, as they should.
WILLOW: What do you think of this?
XANDER: Nice.
XANDER: What?
WILLOW: I was just... remember the eighth grade cotillion? You had that clip-on...
XANDER: I was stylin' with the clip-on.
WILLOW: And now here we are, it's Homecoming.
XANDER: Face it, Will. You and I are gonna be in neighboring rest homes, and I'm  gonna be stopping by to have you  adjust my... my... I can't think of anything that's not really gross.
XANDER: So, uh, you and Oz, how can I put this... are we on first, second or, ye gods?
WILLOW: That is none of your business, Alexander Harris.
XANDER: (impressed) Oh, rounding second.
WILLOW: You don't know that, what about you and Cordelia?
XANDER: A gentleman never talks about his conquests.
WILLOW: Since when did you become a --
WILLOW: -- gentleman.
WILLOW: I know. "Nice".
XANDER: (sincerely) I was gonna go with "gorgeous".
WILLOW: Really? (he nods) You, too. In a guy way.
XANDER: Oz is very lucky.
WILLOW: So is Cordelia -- in a girl way.
WILLOW: I don't know if I can dance in this. (thinks) I don't know if I can dance...
XANDER: Come on, piece of cake. Here.
XANDER: That seems to...
WILLOW: Yeah, it shouldn't be a... (they get even closer) ...problem.
XANDER: No... no problem...
XANDER: That didn't just happen.
WILLOW: No. I mean it did but it didn't.
XANDER: Because I respect you -- and Oz -- and I would never --
WILLOW: I wouldn't ever, either. It's the clothes. It's a fluke.
XANDER: It's a clothes fluke, and that's what  it is and there'll be no more fluking.
WILLOW: Not ever.
XANDER: We got to get out of these clothes.
WILLOW: Right now!
XANDER: Oh, I didn't mean --
WILLOW: Me, either!
BUFFY: Ms. Moran, I'm so glad I ran into you. I had a little incident last year of... getting kicked out of school. I'm back, I've done all my make-ups but I still need one written recommendation from a teacher -- I  think the word Principal Snyder used was "glowing" -- for my file, to show I belong here.
MORAN: And you are...?
BUFFY: Buffy. Buffy Summers, second row, third from the front in your class... (Moran shrugs) ..."Contemporary American Heroes:  From Amelia Earhart to Maya Angelou", the class that changed my life?
MORAN: Were you absent a lot, uh...?
BUFFY: Buffy.
CORDELIA: Hi. I hope you'll consider me for Homecoming Queen...
BUFFY: I can't believe it. My favorite teacher and she didn't remember me. I'm like a non-person. Am I turning invisible? (to Oz) Can you see me?
OZ: Big as life.
BUFFY: At Hemery I was Prom Queen, Fiesta Queen, I was on the cheerleading squad -- the yearbook was, like, a  story of me. Now it's senior year and I'm going to be one crappy picture on one eighth of one crappy page.
XANDER: Uh, no, actually, you're not.
BUFFY: What do you mean?
XANDER: Well, you missed the picture taking.
BUFFY: When? Why?
OZ: We did 'em yesterday.
WILLOW: Didn't Cordelia tell you?
CORDELIA: Buffy, you look so adorable in that --
BUFFY: I'm not voting for you.
CORDELIA: Then make it snappy.
BUFFY: Why didn't you tell me they were doing the yearbook pictures?
CORDELIA: Didn't I? Guess I forgot. What's the big?
BUFFY: The big is that it's the yearbook! It's the book about...the year!
CORDELIA: Yeah, hence the name.
BUFFY: You just could have thought about someone else for thirty seconds, that's all.
CORDELIA: Hey, I'm under a lot of pressure here.
BUFFY: Oh, yeah, Homecoming campaign. Rough gig.
CORDELIA: What would you know about it? Just because you were Guacamole Queen when you were three doesn't mean you understand how this works.
BUFFY: Yeah, apparently it involves handing out these entirely lame flyers.
CORDELIA: No, it involves being a part of the school and having actual friends. Now if it was about monsters and blood and innards, you'd be a shoo in.
CORDELIA: Like to see you try to win the crown.
BUFFY: Oh, you would?
BUFFY: Then you will.
CORDELIA: What do you mean?
BUFFY: I'll show you how it's done. I'll go for Homecoming Queen and I'll win.
CORDELIA: This is starting to be sad.
BUFFY: Sorry, Cordy, but you have no idea who you're messing with.
CORDELIA: What, the Slayer?
BUFFY: I'm not talking about the Slayer. I'm talking about Buffy. You've awakened the Prom Queen within, Cordy. And that crown is gonna be mine.
TRICK: Competition is a beautiful thing. Makes us strive. Makes us accomplish. Occasionally makes us kill.
TRICK: We all feel the desire to win, whether we're human... (indicates the humans) ...vampire... (indicates the Gorches) ...or... (Kulak) ...whatever the hell you are, my brother, got them spiny looking head things, I never seen that.
KULAK: I am Kulak, of the Miquot clan.
TRICK: Isn't that nice. Point is, you're all here for one reason.
GORCH: Well, it wasn't for no philosophy class.
TRICK: Mr. Gorch. My account statement  shows your deposit has yet to be made.
GORCH: Me and Candy blowing our whole honeymoon stash on this little game.
TRICK: They're dirty.
GORCH: They're non-consecutive.
TRICK: In a few days time, the game will commence. You will all have the  opportunity to bring down not one but two of the toughest prize bucks this world has to offer. The first target, Buffy, you've all seen. The second, Faith, is a little more elusive, but both targets will be together and  ready for the killing and that's a money-back guarantee. Ladies, Gentlemen, and spiny-headed lookin' creatures... welcome to SlayerFest. Ninety eight.
BUFFY: ...it's won or lost in the trenches. Holly, Michelle... (hits board with pointer on each name) ...and our real competition,  Cordelia, all have a big head  start -- speaking of Cordelia's head, if I had a watermelon that big, I'd be rich!
BUFFY: -- waits for laugh...right, don't rag on the competition, makes me look petty. Anyway, I've done this  before, it's just like any other popularity contest -- the only difference being that this time I'm  not actually popular. But I'm not unpopular, exactly. I mean, a lot of people came to my welcome home party.
WILLOW: But they were killed by zombies.
BUFFY: Good point. Will, I want you to set  up a database, who's for us, who's on the fence, crisis areas. Oz, you take the fringe, musicians, not inclined to vote, could be an important swing. Xander --
BUFFY: Hi Cordelia. I know this is kinda awkward but I don't see why we can't all get along during the campaign. We're all buds, we're all going to the dance together in the limo.
CORDELIA: Great. (to Willow) How's the database coming?
WILLOW: Uh... it's... just about done.
CORDELIA: Xander?
XANDER: I've got your new flyers...
CORDELIA: Let's get cracking.
XANDER: (to Buffy) She's my girlfriend.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) It's just... she needs it so much more than you do.
OZ: As Willow goes so goes my nation.
CORDELIA: Thanks for what you said, Buffy. I  think we're getting along good, don't you?
GILES: Seems an awful lot of fuss for a little title.
BUFFY: Giles, it's no fun if you don't try your best.
GILES: As long as fun is still in the mix...
BUFFY: Sure. It's not like anyone takes it that seriously.
GORCH: Hey, Swiss Army Knife -  wanna reign it in a little?
CANDY: Sugar, everyone else's got weapons and plans, shouldn't we be...?
GORCH: Don't worry, I got a plan. You forget, I'm the only one in this game actually knows the Slayer, what she'll do.
CANDY: You are just a big, strong, manly cowboy and I love you.
GORCH: Gimme that sugar.
SCOTT: Here.
BUFFY: (awkwardly) Oh. Thanks.
SCOTT: (looking at flyer) I heard you were doing this.
BUFFY: It's just something to fill the time, it's kind of silly, really.
SCOTT: I don't think so. For what it's  worth, you've got my vote.
BUFFY: I really don't want to -- (stops herself) Thank you.
BUFFY: Hi.
WILLOW: Oh hi. How are you? You good? You look good. And what else is new with you? Did I mention you look --
BUFFY: Will, it's okay, you helping Cordelia. You're my friend, I'm not going to hold it against you.
WILLOW: No, I'm not a friend, I'm a rabid dog who should be shot, but there are forces at work here, dark incompressible forces...
BUFFY: And I'm sure they're more important than all we've been through together or how many times I've saved your life...
WILLOW: (tiny voice) What do you want?
BUFFY: Fifteen minutes alone on your computer with Cordelia's data base.
WILLOW: (tinier voice) 'Kay.
BUFFY: So I called the limo place and we're  all set. It's going to swing by  Faith's, then my place...
BUFFY: You know, Jonathan, I've always felt a special bond between you and me --
JONATHAN: Cordelia gave me six bucks. That  buys a whole lotta cupcakes.
BUFFY: Okay, how 'bout... you vote for me and I don't beat the living crap out of you.
JONATHAN: That works good for me. (backs away)
BUFFY: (cheery) Tell your friends!
CORDELIA: Are you kidding? I've been doing the Vulcan death grip since I was four!
BUFFY: You're giving out money now?
CORDELIA: So? Is that any more tacky than your faux "I'm shy but deep" campaign posters?
BUFFY: Yes.
CORDELIA: This whole trying to be like me really isn't funny anymore.
BUFFY: I was never trying to be like you and when was it funny?
CORDELIA: I don't see why your pathetic need to recapture your glory days gives you  the right to splinter my vote!
BUFFY: How can you think it's okay to talk to people like that? Do you have parents?
CORDELIA: Yeah. Two of them. Unlike some people.
BUFFY: Your brain isn't even connected to your mouth. Is it?
CORDELIA: Why don't you do us both a favor and stay out of my way?
BUFFY: Don't ever do that again.
CORDELIA: You're sick, you know that?
XANDER: Okay, let's not say things we'll regret later --
CORDELIA: Crazy freak!
BUFFY: Vapid whore!
WILLOW: This is just --
WILLOW: -- the worst thing that's ever happened.
XANDER: I know, I know, but when I look at you now... (puts his hands on her shoulders) ...it's like I'm seeing you for the first time, I know it's crazy but I can't help it.
WILLOW: I'm talking about Buffy and Cordelia.
XANDER: (drops his hands) Me too.
WILLOW: What are we gonna do? We have to do something. This is all our fault.
XANDER: How do you get from chick fight to "our fault"?
WILLOW: Because, we felt so guilty about the fluke we went overboard helping Cordelia -- and spun the whole group dynamic out of orbit -- we're a  meteor storm heading for earth!
XANDER: Okay, calm down, let's put our heads together and think of something. One of us is pretty darn smart and I'm... just in hell. I thought being a  Senior -- at last -- and having a girlfriend -- at last -- would be a  good thing. Shouldn't that be a good thing? (she smiles) What?
WILLOW: Sometimes when you're falling apart your mouth does the sweetest thing.
XANDER: My mouth?
WILLOW: What are we gonna do?
XANDER: We just gotta get the two of them communicating.
WILLOW: I'm talking about us.
BUFFY: "Dear Cordelia and Buffy, we won't be riding to the dance with you. We want you to work out your problems because our friendships are more important than who wins Homecoming Queen. Your friends. P.S., the limo was not cheap, work it out." (beat) Well...
BUFFY: They gave us corsages?
CORDELIA: I took the orchid.
BUFFY: Oh. (takes out other corsage, pins it to her dress) Nice of you to check with me on that.
CORDELIA: I don't see what the big deal is.
BUFFY: I'm not making a big deal. You wanted the orchid, you took the orchid.
CORDELIA: It goes with my complexion better.
BUFFY: It does have a sallow tint... (limo stops) Finally, we're here...
CORDELIA: What is this? (calls out) Okay you guys, we've had enough of your stupid games.
BUFFY: What's massively wrong with this picture?
TRICK: Hello ladies, welcome to SlayerFest ninety-eight. What is a SlayerFest you ask? Well, as in most of life, there's the hunters and the hunted. Can you guess where you two fall? You have exactly thirty seconds from the beginning of this tape -- (checks watch) -- ooo, seventeen now -- to run for  your lives. Faith, Buffy, have a nice death.
CORDELIA: Hello, how stupid are you people. She's a Slayer, I am a Homecoming Quee --
FAITH: What are you two so mopey about?
XANDER: We're not mopey. We're grooving. On Oz' band. He's a wonderful guy, Oz.
WILLOW: (verge of tears) He wrote this song for me.
FAITH: That sleazebag...
GILES: We've got to find Buffy. Something terrible's happened. (off their looks) Just kidding. Thought I'd give you a scare. Are those finger sandwiches?
XANDER: Giles is developing a sense of humor.
WILLOW: I'm scared, too.
BUFFY: We gotta get off this path...
CORDELIA: I have an idea: we talk to these people, we explain I'm not a Slayer, they let me go... LOOK OUT!
BUFFY: That's gotta smart. Now, I can let you out of that trap or I can put a bullet in your head. How many are there in this little game and what are they packing?
FRAWLEY: There's me, two Germans with AR-15's and grenade launcher, yellow-skin  demon with long knives, vampire couple from Texas named Gorch.
BUFFY: That everybody?
FRAWLEY: Everybody who's out here. Germans are wired -- their boss is tracking them on computer. Now get me out of this!
BUFFY: Tell you what. If I live, I'll send the S.P.C.A for you. And if I ever see you again, I'll kill you where you lean.
CORDELIA: Could you do me an eensy favor? Tell your friends that I'm not --
FAITH: Scott, there you are, Honey. Good  news -- doctor says the itching and the swelling and the burning should clear up, but we gotta keep using the ointment. (to his date, nice) Hi.
GILES: I suspect these finger sandwiches contain actual finger. I think I'll retreat to the library until the  coronation, I want to be here when Buffy... however it turns out for her -- and that was a fine thing you two did putting Buffy and Cordelia together. (he goes)
WILLOW: We did one fine thing.
XANDER: Yeah. They've been gone a while, they must really be getting into it.
BUFFY: We're safe for the time being, look for a weapon.
CORDELIA: Safe? I'm not safe, I'm going to die.
BUFFY: You are if you just stand there.
CORDELIA: I'm never going to be crowned Homecoming Queen, I'm never going to graduate high school, I'm never going to know if it was real between me and Xander or some temporary insanity that made me think... I loved him. (starting to cry) And now I'll never get to tell him.
BUFFY: Yes you will. We're going to get out of here -- then we're going to the library where Giles and more weapons live -- and we're gonna take the rest of these creeps out in time for you to congratulate me on my sweeping victory as Homecoming Queen.
CORDELIA: I know what you're up to, you think if you can get me mad enough I won't be so scared -- and hey, it's working, where's a damn weapon?!
BUFFY: Do you really love Xander?
CORDELIA: Well, he just... grows on you, like a Chia Pet.
BUFFY: (re: spatula) That's it?
CORDELIA: Just this and a telephone.
BUFF: Telephone? You didn't think a  telephone would be helpful?
CORDELIA: (re: spatula) This is better for... (mimes hitting, then:) ...oh.
TRICK: Popcorn? Not bad for microwave.
MAN: You're about to see why Daniel Boone and that idiot demon are creatures of the past, and why I am the future.
TRICK: I love the future. It's just like the past, only shiny.
MAN: (re: computer) I'm picking up a signal...radio...? They've got a phone!
BUFFY: (into phone) If you get this message, Giles, get help, get out here... hello? (clicks receiver)
CORDELIA: What happened?
BUFFY: It just went dead.
KULAK: Want me to cut that leg off for you?
FRAWLEY: (clenched teeth) No thanks.
VOICE: Giles, it's me. And Cordelia. We're in a cabin in Miller's Woods, we got big trouble...
MAN: (into headset) I have them both in range.
CORDELIA: Why is it...every time I go somewhere with you, it always ends in violence and terror?
BUFFY: Welcome to my life.
CORDELIA: I don't want to be in your life. I want to be in mine.
BUFFY: Please feel free to walk out that door and live it at any time.
CORDELIA: All I wanted was to be Homecoming Queen.
BUFFY: Well that's all I wanted too,  Cordelia, I spent a year's allowance on this dress...
CORDELIA: I don't get why you even care about Homecoming when you're doing stuff like this.
BUFFY: Because this is all I do. This is what my life is, fighting monsters no one even knows about while everyone else gets to... I thought Homecoming Queen, I could open a yearbook someday and say "I was there. I went to high  school and had friends and for one  minute, I got to live in the world." And there'd be proof. Proof that I was  chosen for something other than this. (holds up gun) ... besides (pumps shell in gun) ... I look cute in a tiara.
CORDELIA: Do you hear --
BUFFY: (between punches) Cor... the gun!
BUFFY: Cor... the spatula!
CORDELIA: Buffy!
MAN: Launch.
BUFFY: We gotta get to the library.
BUFFY: ...now.
GORCH: Easy darlin', those things'll go through ya' quicker 'n Grampa Pete's chili.
CANDY: I want to do Buffy, my weddin' present fer what happened to you poor brother. When's she comin'?
GORCH: He's her Watcher. She'll show soon as she takes out some a our competition.
CANDY: Can I eat 'im?
GORCH: Course you can, sugar. I'm hoping to get a little information out of him first.  (kicks Giles a little) Wish you hadn't a clocked him so good.
CANDY: Hell, I hit you harder 'n that.
GORCH: But I'm your husband and I like it.
CANDY: (seductively) Do you?
GORCH: Gotta have that sugar.
TRICK: They got away?
MAN: Temporarily...
TRICK: Give it up for the Slayers, they got character. (problem) What do I do if they survive? (solution) Re-match next year -- bring on the money... (re: computer) ... go girls, go!
TRICK: I'll take care of it.
TRICK: Good evening, gentlemen. What can I do for --
TRICK: Excuse me, someone have a warrant here?
BUFFY: Jungle Bob and spike-head are down and out, we lost the Germans twice, but they seem to keep finding us -- we take them out and the Gorches, we can still make Homecoming.
CORDELIA: Those animals, hunting us down like poor defenseless... well, animals, I guess.
BUFFY: Now we just need --
CORDELIA: Buffy!
GORCH: Candy!
GORCH: First ma' brother Tector, now ma' wife...
GORCH: I'll kill ya' fer this, Slayer...
GORCH: ...you too, you're dead meat, ya' hear?!
CORDELIA: (incredibly cool) I hear you, you red-neck moron. You got a little dress goes with that hat?
GORCH: I'm gonna --
CORDELIA: I know, rip out my innards, play with my eyeballs, boil my brain and eat it for brunch -- now listen up, needle- brain, Buffy and I have taken out four of your cronies, including your girlfriend --
GORCH: WIFE!
CORDELIA: -- whatever, point is, I haven't even worked up a sweat. See in the end Buffy's good, but she's just the runner-up. I'm the Queen. If I get mad, what do you think I'm gonna do to you?
GORCH: Later!
GILES: That was...
CORDELIA: Bah!
MAYOR: Hello. It's nice to meet you.
TRICK: (non-plussed) Yeah, hi, what a pleasure. Where am I?
MAYOR: In my office. I'm Richard Wilkins, I'm the Mayor of Sunnydale. And you're Mr. Trick. Please sit down.
MAYOR: That's an exciting suit.
TRICK: Clothes make the man.
MAYOR: As I understand it you're not a man exactly. Mr. Trick, I've been mayor for quite some time. I like things to run smoothly. You see, this is a very important year for me.
TRICK: Election year?
MAYOR: (smiling) Something like that.
TRICK: If this is the part where you tell me I don't fit in your quiet little neighborhood you can skip it 'cause that all got old before I was a vampire, you know what I'm saying?
MAYOR: Do you have children?
TRICK: None living. I think I got some descendants in Gainsburg or somewhere.
MAYOR: Children are the heart of a community. They have to be looked after. Controlled. The more rebellious element needs to be dealt with.
TRICK: I see...
MAYOR: The children are our future. We need them. I need them.
TRICK: Well, if the 'rebellious element' means who I think it does, that  problem may take care of itself this very night.
MAYOR: So I've heard. Very enterprising idea of yours, SlayerFest. That's the kind of initiative I need on my team.
TRICK: And what if I don't want to be part of the team?
MAYOR: Oh no, that won't be an issue. You and I are going to get along very well.
MAYOR: Moist towelette?
GILES: (to Buffy) You should have seen Cordelia.
BUFFY: (to Cordy) Teach 'em to mistake you for a slayer.
GILES: I feel somewhat to blame for that, I did give your friends tacit approval to pull the switch in the limousine...
BUFFY: It wasn't all bad, Cor and I spent some quality death time.
CORDELIA: And we got these free corsages.
GILES: I don't recall them saying anything about corsages...
BUFFY: No?
BUFFY: ... Jungle Bob said the Germans were hooked into a computer system...
CORDELIA: Oh God! Get rid of that thing.
BUFFY: Give me yours. (thinks) I need some wet toilet paper.
CORDELIA: Oh yeah, that'll help.
MAN: (excited) They're fifty feet away!
MAN: Both targets, axis seven degrees...
MAN: I won!
DEVON: Okay guys, it's the moment we've all been waiting for...
WILLOW: They're gonna announce the Queen, where are they? What's taking them so long?
XANDER: Oh God, what'd you do to each other?
BUFFY: Long story.
CORDELIA: Got hunted.
BUFFY: Apparently not that long.  (cont'd) I'll tell you though, you don't ever  want to cross Cordy.
XANDER: Heh, heh -- no.
DEVON: In this envelope I hold the name of this year's Homecoming Queen.
CORDELIA: You know, after all we've been through tonight, this whole who-gets-to-be- Queen-capade seems pretty...
BUFFY: ... damn important.
CORDELIA: Oh yeah.
DEVON: And the winner is... Hey, I believe this is a first for Sunnydale High... we have a tie!
DEVON: Holly Charleston and Michelle Blake!
MICHELLE: I'm just so honored, I can't believe it! I mean, that you would have chosen me -- us -- out of all the girls in school...it's just so...wonderful!
