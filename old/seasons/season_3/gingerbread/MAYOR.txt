I want to thank you all for coming in the aftermath of such a tragic crime. Seeing you here proves what a caring community Sunnydale is. Sure, we've had our share of misfortunes - but we're a good town, with good people. And I know none of us will rest easy  until this horrible murder is solved. With that in mind...
I make these words my pledge to you. Never Again.
And now, I ask you to give your  attention to the woman who brought  us all here tonight, Joyce Summers.
