Mom? What are you doing here?
Mom, you know the Slaying, it's kind of an alone thing.
It's really pretty dull. Bam boom stick poof. Not much to--
He's not Mr. Sanderson anymore, Mom, he's-
Stay!
They said we can go home now.
I saw.
I'm so sorry you saw this. But it's  going to be okay.
I'll find whatever did it.
It's okay. I'll take care of everything.  I promise, mom. Just...try to calm down.
(frantic) Don't tell me to calm down!
They were kids, Giles, Little kids.  You don't know what it was like to see them there. Mom's just... she  can't even talk.
I know.
There were no marks. Wait. I mean, there was a mark, a symbol.
It was on their hands. The cops are keeping it quiet, but I got a good look at it.
Find the thing that uses this symbol  and point me at it.
Giles. Speak. What?
A group of... human beings. Someone with a soul did this?
Okay. So while you're looking for  the meaning of the squiggly mark - maybe you could turn up a loophole on the "slayers don't kill people" rule.
Oh, it's completely personal. So find me the people who did this. Please.
You guys didn't hear?
A murder. Somebody killed two little kids.
Like, maybe seven or eight years old. My mom found the bodies during  patrol last night.
More bad. She picked last night, of all nights, for a surprise "bonding" visit.
No, the point is she's completely  wigging.
Uh, well, everyone. You know, 'cause of.... what happened.
(uncomfortable) Uh, yeah. He says it looks like something ritual, occult. He's still looking. We're going to add to my  patrols, keep a closer eye on things...
Mom. Can I talk to you for a sec?
Mom, this isn't really --
No, it's just... this hall is about  school. You're about home. Mix  them and my world dissolves.
Oh. Well, Giles can always use--
You called everyone you know?
Uh-huh. That's great. But, you know what? A lot of times, when you're working on something like this, you try to keep the number of people who know about it, kind of... small.
(to Willow) This is great. Maybe we can all go patrolling together later...
Hi.
(to Amy and Michael) You guys okay?
I doubt they'll have more trouble.
Cordelia--
(calling after) I get that. But witches didn't do it!
You found the meaning of the symbol?
Hey. Is Willow around?
Are those hers?
Xander. You are guilty. You got illicit smoochies and you have to  pay the price.
What's this?
(to Will/ignoring him) This is a witch symbol.
(shocked) Willow.
This symbol was on the murdered kids.
I don't get it. What are they  looking for?
Giles?
Giles, we need those books.
There's something about this symbol  we're not getting. Willow used it in  a protection spell. She said it's  harmless - not a big bad. So why would it turn up in a ritual sacrifice?
Using what? The dictionary and "My  Friend Flicka"?
Answer to MOO? Did that sentence make some sense that I'm just not in on?
And who came up with that lame name?
You're the one who ordered the raid on the school today.
Lockers. First syllable, lock. They're supposed to be private. Also, they took all of Giles' books away.
But we need those books now. To help solve this thing.
Mom, I hate that these people scared you so much. And I know you're  trying to help. But you have to let  me handle this. It's what I do.
I don't think they run out--
Okay. Maybe I don't have a plan. Lord knows I don't have lapel buttons...
...And maybe the next time the world is getting sucked into hell, I won't  be able to stop it because, guess what, the anti-hell-sucking book isn't on the approved reading list!
Yeah. You did. But you know what? I have to go. I have to go out on  one of my pointless little patrols now, and "react to" some vampires,  if that's all right with MOO.
And nice acronym, Mom.
Hey. How are you?
It's strange... People die in Sunnydale all the time. And I've never seen anything like this.
And Mr. Sanderson from the bank had it coming?
My mom... She said some stuff to me. About being the Slayer. That it's  fruitless. No fruit for Buffy.
Was she? Is Sunnydale any better  than when I came here? Okay - so  I battle evil. But I don't really win -  the bad keeps coming back and  getting stronger. I'm like that kid  in the story, the boy who stuck his  finger in the duck.
Oh. Okay, now that story makes a  lot more sense.
But we never --
Not completely.
Right. Their parents.
(deep in thought) No. It's a lot...
These kids. What do we know  about them?
Facts. Details.
Where'd they go to school? Who are  their parents? What are their names?
We know everything about their deaths, but we don't even know  their names.
And if no one know who they are,  how did they get these pictures?
(points to the computer) We need to get some information.
How - she's not even allowed to come  to the phone. The wrath of MOO.
Wait.
The same kids.
They've never been seen alive, just dead. A lot.
And in some language that's English?
Hans and Greta. (light bulb) Hansel and Gretel.
Yeah, it's all falling into place.  Of course, that place is nowhere  near this place...
Hansel and Gretel go home and tell on the mean old witch --
Giles, we have to talk to Mom. If  she know the truth she can defuse this whole thing --
By who?
Michael, stay here and hide. Giles, we'll go find my mom. Oz, you and  Xander --
Oh. Um. Mom? Can we talk to you?
(to Joyce) Mom, we have to talk alone. There's  more going on than you --
(still groggy) You don't want this.
Mom, don't!
Uh oh.
She couldn't do us first?
(sotto voce) What are you gonna do, float a pencil at 'em?
(getting into it) That's right! You will all be turned into vermin... and some of you will be fish... the people in the back will be fish...
Mom, dead people are talking to you. Do the math!
Mom! Look at me. You love me.  If you do this, you won't be able to  live with yourself.
I'm so sorry, Willow. If it wasn't  for me, you never would...
Cordelia, put out the fire!
You know what? Not as convincing in that outfit.
Did I get it? Did I get it?
Your mom doesn't mind us doing this in the house?
(sympathetically) Business as usual?
She forgot everything?
So. You want to try this again?
Maybe we should get her one of those  wheel things.
