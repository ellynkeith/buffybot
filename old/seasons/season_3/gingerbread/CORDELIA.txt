You're gong to be one busy little Slayer, baby-sitting them.
I doubt your doubt. Everyone know witches killed those kids. Amy is a  witch. And Michael is whatever the boy of "witch" is, plus being the  poster child for yuck.
If you're going to hang with them, expect badness, 'cause that's what you get for hanging with freaks and losers. Believe me, I know.
That was a pointed comment about me hanging with you guys.
Get your grubby custodial hands off that! That hair spray cost forty- five dollars and it's imported!
Took you long enough to wake up.  My hand hurts.
Things are way out of control, Giles.  First the thing at school, and then my mom confiscates all my black clothes and scented candles. I came over to tell Buffy to stop this craziness and I found you all unconscious again. How many times have you been knocked out, anyway? I swear, one of these times you're  going to wake up in a coma.
Now let's be clear, the brain damage happened before I hit you.
I can't believe you had this stuff in your apartment. It smells foul.
God. This is killing my manicure. What are you muttering about?
What's it mean?
This? It doesn't look like a toad.
I hate you.
Ow! You got hair with that!
God, you really were the little youthful offender, weren't you? You must look back and just cringe.
Okay. I liked the two little ones better than the one big one.
