Buddy!
(to Jack) Man, You raised me!
Yes!
Hey,
Dude, where are the other guys?  We gotta go get 'em!
How long I been down?
Eight months! Man. I got some catching up to do. (turning to Jack) You been taping Walker Texas Ranger?
Thank god. We'll get the guys together, we'll parTAY. This is gonna be a night to remember.
Let's get some beers!
We gotta have beers, though!
Liquor store. Little Armenian guy, runs  the place, he had a gun behind the  counter. Hey, we should go kick his ass!
What are we gonna do?
Of course he doesn't feel like part of  the group. He hasn't been initiated!
What, are you too good to be dead? You got something against dead people?
Damn! There goes our wheels.
Heyâ€¦ Our wheels!
Which way?
Good for chopping.
Now this is my idea of fun!
