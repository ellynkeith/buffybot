I'm looking for Buffy.
Something's happening. I've seen portents -
I don't think they know what they're dealing with.
No, you'd best stay out of harm's way.
Then let me decide for you. I can  face this thing --
I can at least buy you enough time  for Willow's spell to bind it. Buffy,  this is worse than anything we've  ever faced. It's the only way.
I love you.
Nothing can change that. Not even death.
