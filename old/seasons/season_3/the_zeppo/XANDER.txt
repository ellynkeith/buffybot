I'm good. We're fine over here. Little bit dirty. (dusts himself off) Good show, everyone. Just great. I think we have a hit.
Tip top. Really. If anyone sees my spine lying around, just try not to step on it.
Excuse me: who, at the crucial moment, distracted the lead demon by allowing her to pummel him about the head?
I think you'll find that was more of a bellow.
I say bring 'em on.
But gee, Mr. White, if Clark and Lois  get all the big stories I'll never be a  real reporter. (off his look) Jimmy Olsen jokes are pretty much  gonna be lost on you.
It's okay.
Hey! Bobby! Toss me one. (doesn't work) Les, man, I'm open. (still ignored) Let's go Bobby!
No! I mean I had to do that test when  I was seven, a little slow in some stuff,  mostly math and spatial relations, but  certainly not "challenged" or anything, can I buy you another soda?
(bridles) Hey! It was an accident, okay? Cool down.
(completely folding) What? Starting - like that Michael Jackson song, that was a lot of fun… "too high to get over - yeah yeah." Remember… that fun song…
I coulda taken him.
Why is it that I've come face to face  with vampires, demons, the most  hideous creatures hell ever spit up,  and I'm still afraid of a little bully  like Jack O'Toole?
Why am I not surprised by how comforting you're not?
(laughing) I was just saying to - (whining) Hey! Mind your own business.
I happen to be an integral part of the group and I happen to have a lot to offer.
I do!
But I mean, what is it? How do you get it? Who doesn't have it? And who decides who doesn't have it? What is the essence of cool?
I mean you yourself, Oz, are considered  more or less cool. Why is that?
Is it about the talking? You know, the way you tend to express yourself in short, noncommittal phrases?
No. No. It's the guitar thing. You're in a band, that's like a business class ticket to cool with complimentary mojo after takeoff. I should play an instrument. Is it hard to play guitar?
Okay but on the other hand, eighth grade I'm taking flugelhorn and getting <u>zero</u> trim, so the instrument thing could be a mislead. But you need a thing. One thing nobody else has. What do I have?
And now the mocking, which I can handle because I'm right about this, I'm on the track. Need to find my thing.
You girls need a lift?
What do you mean, what is it? It's my thing!
(slowly, "don't you get it?") My thing…
My thing that makes me cool! You know, that makes me unique. I'm car guy. Guy with a car.
Uncle Roary stacking up the DUI's, letting me rent this bad boy till he's mobile again.
If you could sound less enthused…
Big?
Then we'll handle it together. You know I'm here for you. Just tell me what I can do.
Two of the glazed, two cinnamon, couple of those crème-filled, and a jelly. Let's round that out to four jellies.
Cordelia, feel free to die of a wasting  disease in the next twenty seconds.
I'm busy right now, okay?
You think you know everything -
That's a laugh.
Why, yes, it is.
Uh… very possibly.
Like a dream about warm sticky things.  You wanna go for a little drive?
Well, I have to drop these off, and then  I'd describe myself as 'expendable'.
Angel! Buddy. Friend buddy.  Do you want to stay and talk?
Library, last I saw.
Apocalypse. They're on top of it.
Well, let's go! And tell them that.
But I could help…
It's not like I haven't helped before. (starting her up) I've done quality violence for those people, do they even think of that? They act like I'm some klutz --
All right. Oh god. Stay calm. Little fender bender, it's not --
… the end of the world.
Oh. Gosh. Jack. Hey, are you okay? I'm really sorry about that. Your car came out of nowhere.
Exactly. Okay, I can cover the damages.  I don't have insurance in the strictest  sense of the word, but I have a little  money… The important thing is that  we're okay, and we can work this out  like two reasonable -
I'm fairly certain that I don't want it. But thank you!
Yeah, great knife… although I think (indicating length) it may be technically a sword…
You gave it a girl's name! How very serial killer of you. Lysette, I think we should go.
Would that make you happy?
Mostly I feel Katie.
Again, Katie springing to mind.
And nothing to do with who has the  big sharp --
Well I'm sorry my life or death struggle isn't exciting enough --
No. Just letting off steam. Two guys rasslin'. But not in a gay way.
What.
(a little worried) Yay?
What did you have in mind?
Well, what about your car?
Okay, where to?
Yeah. Great. Where are your buddies?
I'll call you…
Maybe I should leave you two to  catch up --
Howdy.
Are they, um… are all your friends dead?
(to himself) I'm sensing that.
Giles. Hey, what's going on?
Oh, we've just been raising… some heck.
Listen, if you guys need help --
Not much chance of that…
I think that's Bob.
When what happens, exactly?
If you guys want me to drop you somewhere…
This time of night, I'm pretty sure nothing's open --
Will!
Nothing! Certainly not crime… What about you?
And the thing that's happening would be…?
Okay, that's it, I'm going to --
Look, something's come up.
No, I'm just kind of busy…
(wimping out) Great… I wanna be in the gang, sure.
What do I gotta do?
Now guys… let's really talk about this.
Yes, but I'm not dying to be in the gang… if you get the… the pun there…
Well, now, what about Jack? Jack isn't dead.
Oh boy.
All right, enough!
I'd say that's pretty much enough excitement for one evening.
Get in!
You think Hell Mama followed us?
(the intimacy making him nervous) Really? Pop?
Oh, I'm up. I'm suddenly very up.
Those two concepts are antithetical.
Did I mention that I'm having a very strange night?
My God… Faith…
Hey…
Long gone. Probably loaded with supplies. Gotta think. (beat) I can't believe I had sex! (thinks some more) Okay, bombs. Already dead guys with bombs. Oh, man, I'm out of my league.
Sorry, I- There's this- I'm not a hundred percent sure, but… It seems like you two have bigger things- (then) Never mind.
Giles'll know what to do. He's way  more calm than Buffy.
Where's the bomb?
In the school where?
(slowly, tough guy) All right. Now I'm gonna ask this once, and you better pray you get the answer right. How do I defuse--
Where's a slayer when you need one?
Shoulda learned by now. If you're gonna play with fire, you got to expect that sooner or later -
Okay. Boiler room.
Hello, nasty…
I'm not leaving here until that thing is disarmed.
You gonna do all that in thirty eight seconds?
Yeah, looks like. So I guess the question really is… who has less fear?
Yeah, but this is different. Blowed up isn't walking around and drinking with your buddies dead. It's 'little bits swept up by the janitor' dead, and I don't think you're ready for that.
(smiling calmly) I like the quiet.
Good boy.
Guys.
Well, give me the quiet life. I'm gonna grab a snack. Anyone want? (heads shake) Oz?
'kay.
