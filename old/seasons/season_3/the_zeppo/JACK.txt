What are you, retarded?
I ought to cut your face open.
(gets in his face) You wanna be starting something?
I get my buddies together, we're gonna kick you're ass till it's a brand new shape. Now get out of here.
I was parked.
Where do you want it?
Where do you want it?
She's called Katie.
You scared?
Your woman's looking on and you can't stand up to me? Don't you feel pathetic?
You know what the difference between you and me is?
Fear. Who has the least fear.
Come on.
Nothing. Just rasslin'.
That was all right.
Hey, you two wanna have some fun?

I'm gonna carve you up and serve you with gravy. You piss me off, boy, you pay the price. First the eyes, then the  tongue, then I'll break every one of  your fingers --
