Now!
Are you okay?
Well, if it wasn't for your clouding spell-
And improved.
Xander, one of these days you're  gonna get yourself hurt.
Or both. You know, with pain and then  the death. You shouldn't be leaping into  the fray like that. You should be fray-adjacent.
(re: demons) So what do we do about the Heroic trio here? Should we burn the bodies?
I hope not. These guys are way too fit.
Can they do it?
And they're in Sunnydale for what? Demon Expo?
Hence my no laughing.
Hey.
(to Giles) Well, do we know why they're here?
Giles, I don't need to see the math.
The Hellmouth. The one that opens -
Remember that demon that almost got out the night I died?
It'll be the first to come out. And it  won't be the worst by a long shot.  The world will be overrun with demons  unless we stop it.
Giles is trying to narrow it down. If  you're up for it, we're headed into  deep research mode.
Thanks. There's something about this one… it scares me. I need my Willow with me.
What is that?
(cringing slightly) Is this a penis metaphor?
(mind elsewhere) Well, it's nice.
Sorry.
Biggest. Maybe more than I can handle.
Tonight?
Why did they do this?
Angel… Why?
The ambulance is coming.
I'm gonna stop them.
(in tears) I don't know what to do!
You can't!
I can't watch you die again!
I love you…
Don't talk like that to me. You may be ready to go but I'm not ready to lose you. This is my fight and if you won't do it my way --
The heart, Faith! Go for its heart!
(nods) He was only out for a few minutes. Longest of my life.
(to Giles) I don't know how you managed to… That was the bravest thing I've ever seen.
