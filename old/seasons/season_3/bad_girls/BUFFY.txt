Faith, really. Now is not the time.
How many times can I say it? I have  never…
Done it…
With Xander!
He's just a friend.
Thanks for the poetry, and no. I  love Xander, I just don't… <i>love</i>  Xander. Besides, I think it ruins  friendships to do stuff like that.
There's one left.
I think too much.
(quietly) On three…
(to herself) Three.
That wasn't diverting! That was  fighting for my life, Miss Attention  Span.
"The count of three" is not a plan.  It's Sesame Street.
No idea. They sure didn't look local.  Grab the weapons, would you?  Maybe Giles can…
Wow, Willow. Looks like early  admission came early this year.
The wooing stage is always fun.
Embrace it, Will. This is a great time.  There's nothing standing between you  and a whole new world.
I hear it's nice. And, a place I'll never  go if I don't pass Mrs. Taggart's chem.  test tomorrow.
I'm there.
I gotta check in with Giles, report on  last night's patrol.
What about? Is he all right?
New watcher.
(to Giles) Is he evil?
The last one was evil.
(to Giles) Is he evil?
Vampires.
Killed 'em.
One of them had swords. I don't think  he was with the other two.
(nodding) Both pointy. With jewels and stuff.
I really really believe that.
And they're back 'cause…
Little bit late…
I will?
Giles always says please when he  sends me on a mission. And  afterwards, he gives me a cookie.
New watcher.
Now, why didn't I say that?
I'll see if I can get her back. (to Wesley) Don't say anything incredibly  interesting while I'm gone.
Faith, wait.
I know this new guy's a dork, but… (long pause) …I have nothing to follow that, he's  just a dork.
That's the job. What else can we do?
That'd be tragic, taking the fun out  of slaying and stabbing and  beheading…
I don't.
You are way off base.
Again with the grunting. I'm not  comfortable with that.
Uh, what about our assignment?
Strike one…
Game over.
Aah!
Faith!
Looking for an amulet. Wasn't really  counting on the special guest stars.  Six against one - hence the hiding.
Wait. Stop. Think.
It's a manhole. Tight space, no  escape - and six against two - not  unlike three against one.
You're just going in? That's your  plan?
We're surrounded!
I hate it when they drown me.
We came for the amulet…
…We're not leaving without it.
Didn't suck.
How about verifying that your "nearly  extinct" cult was out in magnum  force last night? Faith and I got into  a serious party situation.
I had to lather, rinse, and repeat about  five million times to get the sewer  out of my hair, but otherwise, I'm  of the good.
That's one word three times.
Oh my God. I have a chem. test. It's  so sad that I'm happy about that.  Giles. We gotta talk.
We'll talk.
About the overdue book fees.
It was intense. It was like I just let  go, you know, and I became this force.  I just didn't care any more.
I don't think you can. It's kind of a  slayer thing; I don't even think I'm  explaining it well.
Well, the thing was, Faith knew I  didn't want to go down there -
Okay, so the best part -
Right. Got it. Sorry. (to Xander) …so, we're in the sewers, right, and  Faith has three of them on her…
How come your eye always twitches  when I talk about Faith?
"Faith."
What's up.
Uh, Faith? Unless there's a total  eclipse in the next five minutes - it's  daylight.
(grinning) That has potential…
This is your wake up call.
Angel!
Not leaving, are you?
Them? Boys. I like you.
What's the matter? (playing) You're not afraid of little me, are you?
Okay. I can sense this is a business  trip. What's the what?
Dead demon.
-- his amulet. Yeah. It's supposed  to restore his strength.
Well, we've got the amulet.
Wow, speak of the really annoying  person.
He's a friend. Do you have it?
It pooches your jacket.
(to Angel) You'll put it somewhere safe that's  actually safe?
(also rising) I'm gonna do a little recon on  Balthazar.
You know me…
Okay. We got ten, maybe twelve  bad guys and one big demon in  desperate need of a stairmaster.
Okay. But - we need a little more  firepower than… (hands empty) …none. We should get to the library.
Think they're insured?
Want, take, have. I'm getting it.
We should call an ambulance.
I'm not really that hungry.
Nothing. I mean, it's not important.
I am.
No thanks, but I could help make  them if you want them…
Mmm…
Smells nice. What is it?
Good deal. Protection. (sniffs again) I'm surprised, spell stuff is usually  a lot more…
Uh… yeah.
But, there's a "but" here, and it's…  but you shouldn't. Come. Tonight.  Is that cool?
Biggest. And, yes, hairy. Think  danger with a beard.
Right, and why risk yours?
I know, Will, and that's exactly  why I don't want you coming.  It's too dangerous.
Uh, look, I really should… but  later, we'll hang. Okay?
I just wanna get this done.
I can't believe you went back for  that stuff.
We may never even make it to the  warehouse.
Keep moving.
That was too easy…
Faith, WAIT!
Don't move -
We have to call 911. (to him) Don't move, it's okay.
I need a rag… something to…
Wait, we should go back -
Angel!
I'm okay…
(quiet) Yeah. Hooray for me.
Hey.
Are you… how are you doing?
Yeah. I know you think you can  handle this. And you're used to  being on your own. You got your  tough loner act down pretty well.
And maybe its not an act. But right  now, we need each other. We need  to talk about what we're going to do.
Being a slayer is not the same as  being a killer.
You can't shut me out on this, Faith.  Sooner or later, we both have to deal.
I can help you.
Yeah? Who's wrong now?  You can shut off all the  emotions you want, but there's  still the fact that sooner or  later, they have to find a body.
But getting rid of the evidence isn't  making the problem go away.
Faith. You don't get it. You killed a  man.
