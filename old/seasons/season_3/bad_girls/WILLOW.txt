I'm so overwhelmed. I got in! To  colleges. Real live colleges! And  now they're wooing me. They're  pitching woo!
But weird, too. Rejection I can handle  from my long years of training in the  field. But this…
I can help. Chemistry's easy. It's  just like witchcraft, only there's not  as much newt. What do you say?  Study jam at my house? Tonight?
Oh, that's right. He said he needed  to talk to you.
Well, he's looked better…
Yeah, I know what that's like -
Buffy? Test. You know, the one you  didn't come over to study for?
She can't. (to Buffy) You can't. Can you?
Buffy! This is fifteen percent  of the final grade, and that's…
…apparently meaningless.
You like it?
Just a little something we witches  like to call a "protection spell."
Stinky? That's why I added the aloe.  Give me time, and I could be the first  Wicca to do all my conjuring in a pine- fresh scent. So what's the plan?
For tonight's slayage. We're going,  aren't we?
Great!
Sure. Makes sense. You'll be facing  big, hairy danger…
You're risking your life.
Because I'm your friend.
But, I've done this sort of thing  before. Like a million times. I  can totally handle myself and  besides… (holds up bag) Minty fresh protection. So?
Hi.
Okay. You go ahead, I'll just get  my stuff.
Stupid.
