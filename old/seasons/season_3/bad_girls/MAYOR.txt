I just love the Family Circus. That  P.J.'s getting to be quite a handful.
Well. Haven't seen anything like  this in… well, in a good long while.  Where is the owner of these fine  implements?
Do you like Family Circus?
(shudders) Oh! He's always on the furniture.  Unsanitary.
I like to read "Cathy".
So, what about these swords?  What should we do about that?
Let's just keep an eye out. We've  got the dedication coming up in a  few days - we certainly can't have  anything interfering with that.
Well, maybe we should postpone  the… dedication…
The dedication is the final step before  my ascension. I have waited longer  than you can imagine for this. After  the hundred days, I'll be on a higher  plane. And I'll have no more need for…
… Well, let's just say I won't be  concerned with the little things.  Mr. Trick, watch these people.  Anything you find out about them…  well, let's try to see that that  information reaches the slayers.
With any luck, they'll kill each other.  And then everyone's a winner.  Everyone, of course, being me.
Thank you, fellas. Thanks a heap.  Have fun on the camping trip.  Don't forget to roast a wiener for  me, now! Bye bye!
You can come out now.
Backbone of America, those little  guys. Seeing the hope and courage  on their bright little faces - I swear,  I could just eat 'em up.
So, any news about the Eliminati?
Thank you, Mr. Trick. That was  very thoughtful of you.
Curious how he could have gotten  all the way into my liquor cabinet.  Allan, don't we have security guards  working in this building?
Sir… I… I had no idea…
No need to swoon, Allan, but let's  try to keep things secure. (re: Vincent) Lock him up.
Yes. Yes, I expect he will.
(Latin) Potestatem matris nostrae in  tenebris invoco… maledictum  filium tuum ab omni periculo  custodias nunc et in saecula!
(English) I call upon the forces of our mother  in darkness, protect your unholy son  from harm… now… and forever!
I don't understand why Allan  would miss this. He's usually so  punctual.
Let's find out. Open the cage.
Hold on.
Okay! Now we're ready.
Well…
This officially commences the hundred  days. Nothing can harm me until the  ascension. Gosh, I'm feeling chipper.  Who's for a root beer?
