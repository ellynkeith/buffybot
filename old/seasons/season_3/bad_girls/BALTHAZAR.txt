Let me tell you what I see.
I see fear. And remorse. And the  pitiful look of faces which cry out  for mercy. What I don't see is  what I want to see and THAT'S  MY AMULET!
Already I'm bored.
Vincent. Come here.
Closer. Closer.
Let me tell you what I want to see.
Vincent made a noble effort. Man  to man, as befits a true warrior.  He had courage. He had honor.  And I have <b><u>JACK</u></b> TO SHOW FOR  IT!
It has been a hundred years since my  enemy crippled me. Now ultimate  power is within his grasp and I will  not see it happen. This town is MINE  to destroy. My amulet will give me  strength, strength to kill him, to kill  all my enemies, to burn this world to  a cinder! Forget about honor! Forget  about everything but getting my amulet!  Bring the watchers to me. Find the  Slayers and kill them. Kill everything  that gets in your way! GO!!!
Bring them closer.
You know what I want.
He's not wrong about that.
Ah, a trade… intriguing. No. Wait.  Boring. Pull off his kneecaps.
You will tell us everything.
What is this friend's name?
There is one deal! You will die  slowly or you will die quickly!  The man who has my amulet -  <b>what is his name</b>?
Unacceptable! Unacceptable!
Yaarrrgghhh!!!
Slayer…
You think you've won?
When he rises… you'll wish I had  killed you all.
