I - it's you. I mean, you don't remember - how could you? But-
I waited. I waited here for you. But you never... I was supposed to help you.
The Master rose. He let me live - To punish me. I kept hoping - maybe you'd come. My destiny.
I'm... sorry. I just meant-
They're at his factory. It starts tonight.
(hopeful) I - I can take you there.
Wait! I won't hurt you.
You don't believe I want to help you. (he opens his shirt) Believe I want him dead.
What's the plan?
