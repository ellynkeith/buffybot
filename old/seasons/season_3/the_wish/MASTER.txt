Ahhhh. Xander. Willow.
Hungry? I lost my taste for this one. She kept looking at me. I'm trying to eat and she looks at me...
(to Will) Go on.

You killed the girl who was looking for the slayer?
Excellent. The opening will commence as scheduled.
Be my guest.
(mid-speech) Vampires! Undeniably, we are the world's superior race. Yet we have always been too parochial. Too bound to the mindless routine of the predator. Hunt and kill... Hunt and kill... Titillating? Yes. Practical? Hardly... Meanwhile -the humans, with their plebeian minds, have brought us a truly demonic concept: Mass production.
The days of compromise, of living alongside the humans, are over. It's time to take them out. Time to treat them like... well, let's not mince words here -- like the cattle they are!

Welcome to the future!
