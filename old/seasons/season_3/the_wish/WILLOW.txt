Oh, God, Oh, God - Demon, demon - what kills a demon?!
Oh! Nurf? Not nurf! Knife!
(shaken) But we were. And we did. And we're all fine. (re: demon) Isn't he gonna go poof?
We should try to do more socializing with her.
Darn tootin'.
At least tomorrow's Monday. Another school day.
Actually -- I was more thinking "Oz will be there and I can beg for forgiveness."
I want to be strong Willow. But then when I think I might not ever get to be close to Oz again... it's like all the air goes out of the room.
Oz hasn't been to his locker. There may be books in there that he needs, but still he doesn't come.
I don't think so. But she is coming in today. Amy saw her last night at the mall.
I don't know. Amy said she looked pretty scary.
Oz! wow. Look at us. Running into each other - as two people who go to the same school are so likely to do now and then...
Oz. Wait. Please. I don't want to - but I'm capable of scene-making. Hallway scene making.
Okay. Okay. (then) I can't even... What I did - when I think that I hurt you...
Right. But... I want to make it up to you. I mean, if you'll let me -I want to try.
Figuring. That's something. It means there's still a me and you to figure.
But - if we talk now. Maybe we could-
(stricken) It's true. Cordy belongs to the "justified" camp. She should make us pay. And pay and pay and pay and pay... In fact, there's really not enough "pay" to make up for-
(trying) Absolutely. It's self indulgent. I'm in. I'm on the joy train.
Xander. Your hand.
Maybe it used to be. But now that we... It's different. (off his look) I'm sorry. But if I ever want to make things right with Oz - my hands, my... everything - they have to be for him only.
This is the part that's less fun, when there isn't any screaming.
Play now?
I love this part.
No fun. She didn't even hardly fight.
Buffy. (mocking) Ooooh. Scary.
Well, they had crosses --
You're in a big cage.
I felt cheap.
So - you're pleased?  MASTER Ecstatic.
Then... Can I play with the puppy?
Bored now. (then) Daytime is the worst. Cooped up for hours. Can't hunt...
But the Master said I could play.
Isn't that fun, puppy?
Puppy's all quiet. Come on. Don't be a spoilsport.
I know you like it when I come.
Guess what today is? Today the plant opens, it's a big party. You remember I told you about the plant. All those people you tried to save... It'll be quick for them. Not for you, though. It's gonna be slow for you.
That's right, Puppy. Willow's gonna make you bark.
Oooh. Maybe I went too hard on you last time...
Watch it with those things. You almost got my hair.
(re: matches/to Xander) Don't you want to - ?
(re: Angel) Uh oh. Puppy got out.
