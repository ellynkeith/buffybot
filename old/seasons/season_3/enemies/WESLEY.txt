And you say this demon wanted cash?  That's very unusual.
Not really a common term in  demonology...
Of Kane?
As always, my sacred duty as Watcher  prevents me from... why?
Right. Books of Ascension. Mayor.  Slaughter. Bad. Tell you what: Why  don't we try to find this demon sooner  rather than later. Perhaps persuade him  to lend us his books free of charge.
I imagine so. Where is Faith, anyway?
Find anything?
I've had no better luck. There must be something about this Ascension  somewhere.
No, I don't - It should be I that... The  council isn't entirely aware that I'm  letting you work for me. (off his look) With me. I don't think they'd be very  happy with the idea of the two of us  collaborating.
I think the most expedient plan -
Wait for Faith.
Buffy, this is a job that requires the  both of you. This demon could be  anywhere, and if these books are as  important as he says he has good reason  to hide. Finding him is going to be  extremely difficult.
Our enemy has us at a disadvantage. We  seem consistently to be one step behind  him. Now he has the Books of  Ascension. We need to take definitive  action.
Yes, let's, let's stay on track. We'll  need everyone working together here.  Where is Angel?
And Faith?
That's quite all right. Willow?
Good idea. There must be information  on the Mayor there.
Right.
Mayor Wilkins is over one hundred  years old. He's not human.
Angelus has turned? Xander this is  terribly serious. Are you sure?
We must contact Giles immediately.
Well I for one protest. You pitted  Slayer against Slayer in a dangerous  charade that could have gotten both  killed. Without informing me. (petulant) I'm telling the Council.
