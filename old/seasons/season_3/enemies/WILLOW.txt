Ooh! Ooh! The Merenshtadt Text! I  think the section on genocide has  something about ascension.
In the top of your book cabinet, with  the stuff you try to keep hidden.
No, just magic secrets Giles doesn't  think I'm ready for.
Are you okay?
'Cause of him being chopped up into  little bits and all?
Are you sure that's all?
Yeah, but you seem a little on edge  lately. Is anything...
No way. I know what you're thinking  and no way.
Faith would totally do that! Faith was  built to do that! She's the do that girl!
Please! Does Angel come up to Faith's  standards for a guy? Let's see... is he breathing?
Wow, she doesn't even have that  standard. But Buffy: Angel. There's no  way he'd do that. You're the only thing  in the world to him.
Oh, but it's so clear. The way he feels...  Buffy, I too know the love of a taciturn  man. You gotta look at their actions.
Well, what did he say?
So ya bailed?
Enough. Stop with the crazy, go talk to Angel.
Go! I give you leave to go.
(Pointedly, to Buffy) Which means nothing. Two  unconnected events.
It's all bad news. By the time I got  through the encryptions the files were  empty. He musta seen me coming.
(proudly, to Oz) They all liked your plan.
Whoa. Big hey whoa. Guys. Check this out.
Xander! What happened to you?
Faith and Angel - together?
Are you all right?
(awed) His debt to you is repaid? What did you do?
Graduation Day... That's a big scary un- fun, but at least Angel's not bad. And  that's good, right?
