And what exactly did this demon look like?
And you say he has the Books of  Ascension, or will soon, and he was  willing to... sell them?
Hmm. You know what I wish? I wish  that you would pull your hair back.
You worry too much for a girl your age.  That's unnecessary stress. Luckily, I  have just the thing.
Oh. Well, frankly, I don't like to think  about that. I like good, positive, "up"  thoughts. If you failed me in that way...
No? Oh. I know what you want.
There's no need to convince me. I'm  sure you gave it your level best. I just  don't understand what that boy could  be thinking.
Don't be discouraged. You're a bright,  young, energetic girl with a whole life  ahead of her and I won't tolerate  brooding. So you couldn't give him  one moment of true happiness.
And he spurned your advances. So be  it. There's more than one way to skin a  cat, and I happen to know that's  factually true. We want to take Angel's  soul away.
Mint?
Big job, all right.
That's just swell. Say, sure you don't, uh...
Let's just take things step-by step for  the moment. Now then. Angelus. May I  call you "Angel?"
You know, Angelus, "attitude" may get  you attention, but courtesy wins  respect. I am the one responsible for  your new attitude.
No trouble with the transition? No side effects?
That's terrific. Poetic, too. Not that I  read much poetry. Except those little  ones in Reader's Digest. Some are quite catchy.
Kids today. Rush, rush, rush. The  point, Angel, is that you're a powerful  young man. Good for Faith. And there just may be a future for you here in Sunnydale. (beat) I see you're admiring my letter-opener.
Please do.
(shivers) Eeugh, awful things. Unsanitary. But my question is, now that Faith has  brought you back, what are your  intentions?
Fine! Nice to hear you're not one of  those "slacker" types running around  today. Torture Buffy. Killing her's fine,  but make it a slow one.
Wonderful. We don't want a  replacement Slayer anytime soon. They  can't all turn out like my girl Faith.  Have fun!
Try to have her home by eleven.
From where I'm sitting, it's batting  average that counts. So, you lost some friends.
So then what are you worried about?  Chin up. You don't see me looking  disappointed, do you? Heck no. Know why?
