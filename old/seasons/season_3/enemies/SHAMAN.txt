You have risked great danger in calling  on me. The deadliest Magicks are  needed to rob this creature of its soul.
And so it shall be done.
(Arabic; transliterated) Yaa shayTann, inna nafsak Laa tatba'uk ba'd. Yaa Rufukayl al-'aZim, shattit Nafsah fii anHaa'I 'I- 'aalam al-arba'a. (English) Demon, your soul no longer belongs to you, Mighty Rofocale, scatter his soul to the four corners of the world.
(Arabic; transliterated) Yaa ruuh idhhabii! Yaa Nafs idhhabii! Utrukii Ayyaah wa-'trukiih MaHruuman wa-najisan! (English) Spirit, depart! Soul depart! Leave this one and leave him bereft and unclean!
The task is finished.
This restores the balance between us,  Rupert Giles. My debt to you is repaid  now in full. Do not call upon me again.
And with you.
