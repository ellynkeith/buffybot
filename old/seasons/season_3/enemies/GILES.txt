Demons after money. Whatever  happened to the still-beating heart of a virgin? No one has standards anymore...
I'm not sure...
Where did you find that volume?
Yes, quite. There's reference here to the  journal of Desmond Kane, pastor of a  town called Sharpsville. "May 26th,  1723. Tomorrow is the ascension. God  help us all." That was last anyone  heard.
Of Sharpsville. The town more or less  disappeared, it seems.
I think you'll want to meet with this  demon, Buffy.
A six course banquet of nothing. With a  scoop of sod all as a palette cleanser.
Perhaps I should contact the Council,  run a search through the main branch -
I'm not about to burst into glorious  song about it myself. But why don't  you give them a call.
Did you get a receipt?
Again, you see? No standards. Any self- respecting demon should be living in a  pit of filth or a nice crypt.
Buffy, I think you should try to retrieve  the Books of Ascension. Try the  Mayor's office, but be damned careful.  Don't confront the Mayor; we don't  know a thing about him.
Wesley, why don't you take the group  there and start looking.
There's just the one group.
Anyone finds out anything, they check  in with me.
Be careful.
Yes. Thank you for coming to me. And for that rather effective light show  you put on.
I shan't. Peace with you.
I introduced him to his wife.
Yes, I think you should. We have a  rogue slayer on our hands. I can't think  of anything more dangerous.
And we know a little more about the Ascension.
