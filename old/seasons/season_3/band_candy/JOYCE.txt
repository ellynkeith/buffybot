You're not in the band.
Buffy, what would I do with forty  chocolate bars?
Twenty.
I'm the best.
And yet.
Oh, let's not have this conversation.
Honey, you failed the written test. They wouldn't even let you take the road test.
I spend enough time not knowing where you are. I don't want to add the possibility that you're on the highway to Chicago.
Stop. Don't. I just . . . don't want you driving, okay? I want you here.
What? You're going out?
Again? Honey, don't you think Mr. Giles is monopolizing an awful lot of your time?
You <u>lied</u> to us, Buffy. And you made us into your alibis. That's playing us against each other and that's not fair.
Were you at the Bronze? What was happening there that was so important?
You're acting really immature, Buffy.
Buffy!
The last time you made a decision on your own you split.
You can't really be trying to use this summer as a reason you should be trusted!
(to Giles) She drives me crazy. I just want to protect her.
Yeah, but at least most parents know what to protect their children from.
Oh!
We decided you made a good point. earlier, honey.
About us over-scheduling you.
We're working out a coordinated schedule for you.
We've got more work to do here, honey. Why don't you give us a little more time? Take the car. Mr. Giles can drive me home.
Keys. Take them.
Bye, honey. Drive careful.
You think she noticed anything?
You've got good albums.
Do you like Seals and Croft? (off his look) Me neither.
How come they call you Ripper?
It's good.
So, you wanna watch TV, Ripper? I know how to order pay-per-view.
Okay. We could go to the Bronze.
It must be exciting, being from England.
Nuh-uh. I feel . . . special. Like I'm just waking up, kind of.
You know, like having a kid and getting married and everything was a dream and now things are back like they're supposed to be.
That's cool. Kind of Juice Newton.
But the store's not open.
Oh, Ripper, wow. That was so brave.
Ripper, be careful!
You are so cool. You're like Burt Reynolds.
Hey!
Of course. You're Buffy. They're giving away candy. Want some candy?
I'm fine. I can have more if I want.
Screw you. I want candy.
Hey look, you want to slay stuff and I'm not allowed to do anything about it? Well, this is what <u>I</u> want to do. So get off my back.
Oh my god. What was I thinking when I bought the geek machine?
Hey!
(to Giles) You know him? Who is he?
You s'pose they're okay?
(to Buffy, holding the phone) Willow wants you. Real bad.
(re: Ethan) What about that man?
Um . . .
Something's going to eat those babies?
The sewers?
The babies must be so scared.
We'll behave.
Can we go home now?
Oh, blow them off. I'll write you a note.
Buffy assures me it happened while battling evil, so I'm letting her pay for it on the installment plan.
Right.
Yes.
