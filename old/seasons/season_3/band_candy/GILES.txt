". . . and on that tragic day, an era came to its inevitable end." That's all there is. Are you ready?
Which of the following best expresses the theme of the passage? A: "violence breeds violence." B: "all things must end."
C --
This is the S.A.T.s, Buffy, not "connect-the-dots". Please pay attention. A low score could seriously harm your chances of getting into college.
This isn't supposed to be easy, you know. It's a rite of passage.
Buffy, please. Concentrate.
C: "all systems tend toward chaos".
Sorry.
Because it is your destiny and because I just bought twenty "cocorific" candy bars.
I'm testing your awareness of an opponent's location during a fight in total darkness. You're to wait five seconds, then throw me the ball.
Not so simple, is--
Ow. Ah. Well done.
Wait, you're not going? We have to patrol.
Oh. But--
Hello, Buffy.
I called Willow. You lied to her about your whereabouts also. We were all concerned.
(to Joyce) Thank you.
I know I'm not your parent, but I do have to look after you. Your mom's right.
All right, come on. Let's not freak out.
I think you should go to bed. We're all tired.
All parents want that.
Yeah, you and I have to be especially careful.
Buffy!
We had an opportunity for a, you might say, a summit meeting. It took priority over study hall. I called in.
Pulling you in two directions, as it were . . . your home life and your duties as a slayer.
It will be tight, but I think we can fit in all your responsibilities.
No way.
Yeah, they're all right.
Wouldn't <b>you</b> like to know.
Hey, listen to this bit. It rocks.
Man. I gotta get a band together.
Let's go out. Have some fun. Tear things up.
Not bloody likely. That place is dead.
It's all right. Hey, you're not cold or anything?
How's that?
Yeah.
You fancy it?
Here.
Oh, copper's got a gun. You'll never use it.
Told him he'd never use it.
Go 'way. We're busy.
For god's sake, let your mum have the bleedin' candy. Come on, Joyce.
Hey. I'm the watcher. You have to do what I say. So bugger off.
What're you doing with her?
Hold it!
Say. This is all right.
Ethan?
Where--
Where'd the bastard go?
He's lying. Hit him!
You're <u>my</u> slayer. Knock those capped teeth down his throat!
'bout time.
I wouldn't.
She never even saw who took them. Lazy cow.
So, let's go do something, right? Find the demon, slash and slay.
"Lurconis dwells beneath the city, filth to filth".
I know this. I knew this. "Lurconis", it means "glutton", and . . . it'll be in the sewers.
You filthy ponce. Afraid of a little demon.
Sorry.
What the hell's that?
Good God.
Was that the math or the verbal?
Well, if you didn't score well, you can take them again.
And you very probably may not.
Hello. Dear me, it certainly looks like your car had an adventure, doesn't it?
Indeed.
