BUFFY: Mom-
JOYCE: Oh! Buffy...
BUFFY: Sorry, I-
JOYCE: No, no... Don't worry about it. I guess I just got used to all the quiet while you were gone. (then) But it's no problem. Look-
JOYCE: Do you like it?
BUFFY: (trying) It's, um, really... I think I'd go with  the hole.
JOYCE: It's from Nigeria. We got a very exciting shipment at the gallery. I thought I'd hang a few pieces in here. It cheers up the room.
BUFFY: It's angry at the room. It wants the room to suffer.
JOYCE: You have no appreciation of  primitive art --
JOYCE: Oh. You're... going out?
BUFFY: If... if it's okay. I want to find Willow  and Xander.
JOYCE: (worried) And - will you be slaying?
BUFFY: Not unless they give me lip.
JOYCE: Do you want a sandwich or something before you go? You must be starving.
BUFFY: I was until that four course snack you served me after dinner...
JOYCE: Well then - let me drive you. I mean,  they could be anywhere-
BUFFY: Mom, if you don't want me to go...
JOYCE: I want to put this whole thing behind  us. Get back to normal. (then) You go - have a good time.
BUFFY: Thanks.
BUFFY: Didn't anyone tell you about playing with pointy sticks? It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye.
XANDER: You... shouldn't sneak up on people like that.
XANDER: Jeez, Buff-
BUFFY: Oh. Go ahead.
XANDER: No, you go.
BUFFY: No, it's-
BUFFY: Nighthawk?
CORDELIA: (struggling) Hello? This would be dust time!
CORDELIA: (mild surprise) Oh. Buffy. Hey-
BUFFY: Hey.
BUFFY: Are you sure it's not too late? Maybe  we should come back tomorrow.
BUFFY: What if he's mad?
XANDER: Mad? 'Cause you ran away and abandoned your post and your friends and your mother and made him lie awake every night worrying about you? (to the others) Maybe we should wait out here.
XANDER: Check it out. The watcher is back on the clock. And just when you were thinking career change. Maybe becoming a "Looker" or a "Seer" -
GILES: Thank you, Xander.
GILES: Welcome home, Buffy.
BUFFY: Yeah, I just got in a few hours ago.  Went to see Mom first...
GILES: Of course. And how did you find her?
BUFFY: I pretty much remembered the address.
GILES: I mean, was everything all right between you --
GILES: Ah. Excuse me.
GILES: Right, then. Tea's on.
CORDELIA: Okay - were you, like, living in a box or what?
BUFFY: It's a long story.
XANDER: So leave out the heartwarming stuff about kindly old people and saving the farm and get right to the dirt -
GILES: Perhaps Buffy could use a little time to adjust before we grill her on her summer activities.
BUFFY: What he said.
XANDER: Fair enough. In fact - you can leave the slaying to us while you settle in - we got you covered.
BUFFY: I noticed. You guys seemed down with the slayage. All tricked out with the walkies and everything -
CORDELIA: Yeah, but our outfits suck. That Rambo thing is so over. I'm thinking sporty. Hilfiger, maybe.
WILLOW: (enthusiastic) Still - we're getting good. I mean, we dust, like, 9 out of 10!
OZ: 6 out of 10.
WILLOW: (with equal enthusiasm) 6 out of 10!
XANDER: Whatever. We've been kicking a little undead booty.
BUFFY: Thanks for the offer, but I kind of want to get back to my routine. You know - slaying, school, kid stuff... You guys up for hanging tomorrow? I'm jonesing for some brainless fun.
XANDER: I would - but I'm tied up.
CORDELIA: You wish.
BUFFY: What about you, Will?
WILLOW: Tomorrow? I...
BUFFY: Come on. Friends don't let friends browse alone.
WILLOW: Okay. I had some school stuff, but... I guess I can change my plans.
GILES: As for school, Buffy, you know you'll have to talk with Principal Snyder before-
BUFFY: On it. Mom's making an appointment with his ugliness.
GILES: It may be tough going. He's quite emphatic about a Buffy-free  Sunnydale High.
BUFFY: (covering her worry) No problem. I'm bringing The Intimidator. One look at "Mom Face" and I know he'll break.
JOYCE: But... you can't keep her out of school. You don't have the right.
SNYDER: I have not only the right but also a nearly physical sensation of pleasure at the thought of keeping her out of school. I'd describe myself as tingly.
JOYCE: Buffy was cleared of all those charges.
SNYDER: Yes, and while she may live up to the not-a-murderer requirement for enrollment, she is a troublemaker, destructive to school property and the occasional student and her grade point average alone is... (smiles, forgetting himself) I'm sorry. Another tingle moment.
JOYCE: I don't see how you can be so cavalier  about a young girl's entire future.
SNYDER: I'm quite sure a girl with talents and abilities such as Buffy's will land on her feet. (glee returning) In fact, I noticed on the way in this morning that Hot Dog On A Stick is hiring. (to Buffy) You'll look so cute in that hat.
BUFFY: Let's go, Mom.
JOYCE: This isn't over. If I have to, I'll go all  the way to the mayor.
SNYDER: Wouldn't that be interesting.
GILES: Well. How did it go?
JOYCE: (furious) Have you ever noticed his teeth? They're like tiny, little rodent teeth -
GILES: Oh, dear...
JOYCE: Horrible gnashing little teeth. You just want to pull them out with pliers.
GILES: Perhaps there's some way he can be over-ruled...
JOYCE: Don't worry about school, honey. If we can't get you back into Sunnydale,  we may be able to swing private school.
BUFFY: (horrified) Like with the jackets and kilts? You want me to get field-hockey-knees?
JOYCE: It's not that bad.
BUFFY: How about home schooling? It's not just for scary religious people anymore.
JOYCE: We'll work something out.
JOYCE: Tell Willow I said hi.
PAT: Oh my word, you must be Buffy!  Look at you - aren't you a picture?
BUFFY: Thanks...
PAT: (shaking Buffy's hand enthusiastically) I'm Pat - from your mother's book club? I'm sure she mentioned me.
BUFFY: Actually-
PAT: I sort of took it upon myself to look after her while you were, you know, off and away or what have you. Between your "situation" and reading "Deep End of the Ocean" she was just a wreck. You can imagine.
PAT: Well, I'm off. We're making empanadas in my Spanish class tonight. You go be with your mother. The two of you need to re-bond.
BUFFY: Pat wishes us quality time.
JOYCE: Oh - I met her in-
BUFFY: Book Club. Got it.
JOYCE: Before I forget - Willow just called.
BUFFY: Where was she?
JOYCE: She got held up. But she said she tried to call.
BUFFY: Was there a message?
JOYCE: No... But I had a thought - what if I invited Willow and Mr. Giles and everyone for dinner tomorrow night. Don't you think that would be nice?
JOYCE: (sheepishly) Since I sort of already did, I'm hoping for a yes.
BUFFY: It'll be fun.
JOYCE: Why don't you run downstairs and get the company plates.
BUFFY: Mom. Willow and everybody aren't company plate people. They're normal plate people.
JOYCE: We never have guests for dinner. Indulge your mother.
BUFFY: So how come that works on me - but not on other people?
JOYCE: It's genetic.
BUFFY: Next time? I get to pick the mother/daughter bonding activity...
JOYCE: You want to - say something?
BUFFY: What? Thanks for stopping by and dying?
JOYCE: How about - goodbye stray cat, who lost it's way. We hope... you find it.
BUFFY: I thought they would be here.
ANGEL: They are. They're waiting for you.
BUFFY: Am I dreaming?
ANGEL: (smiles) I'm probably the wrong person to ask. You'd better go.
BUFFY: I'm afraid.
ANGEL: (matter-of-factly) You should be.
JOYCE: I've been on the phone with the superintendent of schools. He seems more reasonable than that nasty little horrid bigoted rodent man.
BUFFY: Mom-
JOYCE: -anyway, I'm going in to speak with him this afternoon. As for private schools- (she pushes some papers toward Buffy) Miss Porter's accepts late admissions.  I wrote down the information for you-
BUFFY: A girl's school? Okay - so now it's jackets, kilts and no boys? Care to throw in a little foot binding?
JOYCE: (hard) Buffy. You made some bad choices. You may just have to live with some consequences.
JOYCE: Nothing's settled yet. I just wish you didn't have to be so secretive about things. I mean, it's not your fault you have a special circumstance. They should make allowances for you.
BUFFY: Mom. Please. I'm a slayer. It's not like  I have to ride the little bus to school.
JOYCE: Couldn't you tell just a few people? Like Principal Snyder? And maybe  the police? I'm sure they'd be happy  to know that they have a superhero -  is that the right term? It's not offensi -  AAAAHGH!
BUFFY: Welcome to the Hellmouth petting zoo.
GILES: My lord - what a stench.
BUFFY: I told mom, get the Forest Pine or the  April Fresh - but she wanted dead cat.
GILES: I'll take it back to the library and we'll  try to determine its exact origin.
GILES: This is striking. Nigerian?
JOYCE: Yes, I have this wonderful dealer who specializes in ancient-
BUFFY: You know I love art talk as much as the next very dull person - but Giles,  shouldn't we go? We're in research mode.
GILES: You ought to stay here with your mother, Buffy. I'm sure you have lots of-
JOYCE: (interrupting) Please. It's fine. She can go with you.
GILES: Actually, she can't. (to Buffy) You're not allowed on school property.
BUFFY: Oh. (embarrassed) This marks a first. I want to go to school - but school doesn't want me.
GILES: I'm sorry. I'll call as soon as I know  something.
JOYCE: And we'll see you tonight. Dinner?
GILES: Ah - of course. Tonight, then.
OZ: Looks dead. Smells dead. But moving around. Interesting.
CORDELIA: Nice pet, Giles. Don't you like anything  regular? Golf or USA Today or anything?
GILES: We're trying to find how and why it rose from the grave. It's not as if I'm going to take it home and serve it a warm saucer of milk-
OZ: I like him. I think you should call him Patches.
WILLOW: Hey - what about Buffy's Welcome home dinner tonight? I told her mom we'd help out. Bring stuff.
CORDELIA: I'm the dip!
XANDER: You have to admire the purity of it.
CORDELIA: What? Onion dip. Stirring. Not cooking.  That's what I bring.
OZ: Well - let's figure it out. What kind of  deal is this? Is it a gathering, a shin dig  or a hootenanny?
CORDELIA: What's the difference?
OZ: A gathering. Brie and mellow song stylings. Shin dig. Dip - (he nods to Cordelia) Less mellow song stylings. Perhaps a large amount of malt beverage. And a hootenanny... just chock full of hoot and a little bit of nanny.
XANDER: I hate brie.
CORDELIA: I know. It smells like Giles' cat.
GILES: It's not my-
XANDER: And what would we talk about at a "gathering" anyway? "So Buffy - run into any nice pimps on your travels? And by the by, thanks for ruining our lives for the past three months..."
WILLOW: Xander-
XANDER: You know what I mean. She doesn't want to talk about it. We don't want to talk about it. Maybe we should shut up and dance.
WILLOW: Buffy did say she wanted to loosen up. Have some kid time. (to Oz) Hey. Aren't you guys rehearsing tonight? Why don't you play at the party.
OZ: Yeah. I think I could supply some Dingo action.
GILES: I'm not sure that a... shin dig-
OZ: Hootenanny.
GILES: Hootenanny... is the order of the day. Maybe it's best to keep things more intimate. Buffy just got home - I'm sure she's still feeling disoriented.
WILLOW: All the more reason to make her feel welcome. And a big party says, Welcome Buffy!
XANDER: Okay - so one vote from the old guy for smelly cheese night - and, how many votes for actual fun?
GILES: Very well. Have it your way. I'm just glad to have her home...
PAT: There you are. Not thinking about any more flights of fancy, I hope? (not giving Buffy a chance to reply) Joyce said there was room for one more - so I said "forget facial night -  let's party!" I bet you like empanadas.
BUFFY: You want to see my mother?
PAT: Please.
BUFFY: MOM!
JOYCE: Oh, Pat. Good. Buffy, I hope you don't mind-
DEVON: Hey, Buffy.
BUFFY: Uh, hey.
DEVON: So - where do you want the band  to set up?
BUFFY: (stunned) The band?
BUFFY: Hey!
WILLOW: Hey!
BUFFY: This is... large!
WILLOW: You like?
BUFFY: It's great. It's just - I was thinking  more, just us. The gang?
WILLOW: Sorry - what!?
BUFFY: This is amazing. But I still want to hang with just-
BUFFY: Is everything okay? You seem to be... I don't know - avoiding me. In the one-on-one sense.
WILLOW: What? This isn't avoiding. See? Here you are. Here I am.
BUFFY: So - we're cool?
WILLOW: Way. That's why - with the party. 'Cause we're all glad you're back.
BUFFY: Okay.
WILLOW: Okay. Good.
DOCTOR: It's 7:43. Let's call it. He's not coming back.
JONATHAN: ...I think you'll be impressed. It's the Cadillac of mopeds...
STONER: (to the ocher stoner dude) This party? I heard it's for some chick who just got out of rehab.
XANDER: Hey, Buff. What you doing?
BUFFY: Don't mind me. I was just - taking a break from all that wacky fun.
XANDER: Some party, huh? Guess a lot of people are glad you're back.
BUFFY: Yeah. Seems like people I don't even know missed me. (then) Did Giles say if he was going to be late?
XANDER: He was library man last time I saw him. But he'll be here. He wants to celebrate your homecoming. We all do. I mean, it's great having the Buffster back. (to Cordy) Isn't it?
CORDELIA: Totally. (to Xander) Except - you were kinda turning me on with that whole "boy slayer" look.
XANDER: Was I now?
CORDELIA: You bet - "Nighthawk..."
BUFFY: Okay. So. I'll just...
JOYCE: Ooohhh. Look what I found.
JOYCE: The kids have their fun - we have ours.
PAT: Now - how are you holding up, Joyce? Really?
JOYCE: Really? I'm.... (then/letting down) I don't know. While Buffy was gone -  all I could think about was getting her  home. I just knew if I could put my  arms around her and tell her how much  I loved her - then everything would  be okay...
PAT: But?
JOYCE: But things are never that simple, are they? I mean, she's here. She's right in  front of me... So now I can see how  unhappy she is. And I still don't know  what to say - what to do - to make  things right.
GILES: Oh lord.
STONER: Party villa. Can I rock you?
GILES: Excuse me? Hello?
STONER: What can I do you for, London sounding guy?
GILES: I need to speak with Buffy. Right away. I have some information here that's rather urgent-
STONER: YEAH! Fiesta foul! You gotta do a shot!
GILES: (losing it) I need to speak to Buffy! Right now!
STONER: Bunny? (to his stoner bud, concerned) That guy has to do a shot.
GILES: BUFFY!
STONER: Hey! Is there a BUDDY here? I need a Buddy...
STONER: Sorry. He's not here. You got the wrong casa, Mr. Belvedere.
GILES: Hell- Hello...?
WILLOW: You're leaving again? What, you just stopped by to pick up your lint brush and now you're ready to go?
BUFFY: It's not like anyone'll mind.
WILLOW: Oh, no, go ahead. Have a great time, don't forget to not write.
BUFFY: Why are you attacking me? I'm trying --
WILLOW: Wow, and it looks so much like giving up!
BUFFY: I'm just trying to make things easier.
WILLOW: For who?
BUFFY: You guys seemed to be doing fine without me.
WILLOW: We did the best we could! We didn't have much choice in the matter.
BUFFY: Look, I'm sorry I had to leave, okay? You don't know what I was going through.
WILLOW: Well, I'd like to.
BUFFY: You wouldn't understand.
WILLOW: Maybe I don't need to understand. Maybe I just need you to talk to me.
BUFFY: While you're avoiding me like a virulent ebola strain?
WILLOW: This isn't easy, Buffy. I know you're  going through stuff but so am I.
BUFFY: Willow, I know you were worried, but --
WILLOW: I don't just mean that. I mean my life. I have all sorts of -- I'm dating,  I'm having serious dating... with a  werewolf, and I've been studying  witchcraft and killing vampires, and  you were my best friend, I didn't have  anyone to talk to about all this scary  life stuff. Then you come back and you  didn't even ask about me. You just  worried about whether I was mad at you.
GILES: Unbelievable... (as Joyce) "Do you like my mask? Isn't it pretty?  It raises the dead!" (himself) Americans...
GILES: Are you all right? Can you move?
GILES: Good God-
JOYCE: This is a joke - right?
BUFFY: Mom - can you just - Willow and I are talking-
JOYCE: No - I can't "just!" What is this, Buffy?
WILLOW: She was running away again.
BUFFY: I wasn't. I mean, I'm not sure what-
JOYCE: (interrupting her) Well you better get sure and explain yourself right away! Because if you think you can just take off any time you-
BUFFY: Stop! Just - stop! I don't know. Okay?  I don't know what I'm doing.
JOYCE: Don't you leave this house, young lady!
JOYCE: That's it! You and I are going to have a talk.
BUFFY: Mom. Please-
JOYCE: You know what? I don't care. I don't  care what your friends think of me -  or you for that matter - because you  put me through the wringer, Buffy.  I mean it. And I've had schnapps!
JOYCE: Do you have any idea what it's been like?
BUFFY: Mom-
JOYCE: You can't imagine. Months of not knowing. Not knowing if you were lying dead in a ditch somewhere or - I don't know - living it up-
BUFFY: But you told me! You're the one who said I should go. You said - "if you leave this house, don't come back." You found out who I really am and you couldn't deal - remember?
JOYCE: (aghast) Buffy! You didn't give me any time. You just dumped this... this thing on me and expected me to get it. Well -  guess what? Mom's not perfect. I  handled it badly. But that doesn't  give you the right to punish me by  running away-
BUFFY: Punish you? I didn't do this to punish you-
XANDER: Well you did. You should have seen what it did to her.
BUFFY: (exasperated) Great. Would anybody else care to weigh in? What about you? By the dip.
JONATHAN: No thanks. I'm good.
XANDER: Maybe you don't want to hear it, Buffy.  But taking off like that was selfish  and stupid-
BUFFY: Okay - I screwed up! I know it - alright!?  But you have no idea. You have no idea  what happened to me or what I was feeling-
XANDER: Did you even try talking to anybody?
BUFFY: What's the point? There was nothing anyone could do. I just had to deal on my own.
XANDER: And you see how well that went. You can't just bury stuff, Buffy! It'll come right back up to get you...
GILES: (darkly) Good show, Giles.
GILES: Like riding a bloody bicycle.
BUFFY: As if I could have gone to you, Xander.  You made your feelings about me and  Angel pretty clear-
XANDER: Look - I'm sorry your honey was a demon, but most girls don't hop a Greyhound over boy trouble!
CORDELIA: Time out, Xand. I mean, put yourself in Buffy's shoes for a minute. I'm Buffy - freak of nature - right? Naturally,  I pick a freak for a boyfriend...  Then he's Mister Killing Spree, which  is pretty much my fault, and --
BUFFY: (interrupting) Cordy. Get out of my shoes.
CORDELIA: I'm just trying to help. If you haven't  noticed, Buffy, people aren't exactly  lining up to give you props-
WILLOW: Buffy, you never --
BUFFY: (overloaded) Will, just - stop, okay? I can't --
XANDER: Let her finish! You owe her that at least!
BUFFY: (to Xander) God, Xander! Do you think you could stick to annoying me on your own behalf?!
XANDER: Fine. You stop acting like an idiot -  I'll stop annoying you!
BUFFY: Let's talk acting like an idiot - "Nighthawk"!
OZ: Okay. Stepping in now. Being referee guy-
WILLOW: Let them go, Oz. Talking about it isn't helping; we might as well try some violence!
WILLOW: I was being sarcastic!
BUFFY: Xander! The kitchen!
XANDER: Got your back.
JOYCE: Are - are these vampires?
BUFFY: I don't think so-
WILLOW: Buffy! Heads up!
BUFFY: Nope. Not vampires.
XANDER: Man, this sucker wobbles but he won't fall down!
DEVON: Not my guitar! Use the bass.
WILLOW: He just keeps coming!
BUFFY: I know. Try to get him back outside-
JOYCE: On three! (then) One... Two... THREE!
BUFFY: Help me barricade. Come on!
XANDER: I got it - go help Buffy!
BUFFY: Great. Good job every-
BUFFY: Upstairs!
OZ: This way!
WILLOW: She's...
JOYCE: Oh my God.
JOYCE: (worried) What do we do if they get in?
XANDER: I kind of think we die.
GILES: Cordelia - it's me!
CORDELIA: How do we know it's really you and not zombie Giles?
GILES: (exasperated) Cordelia - do stop being tiresome!
CORDELIA: That's him.
OZ: I think the dead man's party has moved upstairs.
GILES: It makes sense. It's the mask in Joyce's bedroom they're after.
CORDELIA: Mask? They're here to exfoliate?
GILES: (ignoring her) The mask holds the power of a zombie demon called Ovu Mobani - "evil eye." (re: sitch upstairs) I don't think we can get past them.
OZ: What happens if they get the mask?
GILES: If one of them puts it on... he'll be the demon incarnate.
CORDELIA: Worse than a Zombie.
GILES: Worse.
JOYCE: Oh, God - Pat! We thought you were-
XANDER: Generally speaking? When the scary things get scared? Not good.
PAT: I live. (looking at the others) You die.
BUFFY: Don't look, Willow!
BUFFY: No!
GILES: Out back!
BUFFY: Not looking. Not looking...
GILES: Oz! Tell Buffy - Moboni's power is in his eyes. She has to go for the eyes  to defeat him!
OZ: Buffy!
BUFFY: Hey - Pat!
BUFFY: Made you look.
OZ: Never mind.
JOYCE: Honey - Are you alright?
BUFFY: Mom-
JOYCE: So is this a typical day at the office?
BUFFY: This? No. (only half-kidding) This was nothing.
XANDER: Nice moves.
BUFFY: You too.
SNYDER: Did we have an appointment?
GILES: I'd like to have a word with you.
SNYDER: If that word is "Buffy" - then I have two words for you. Good riddance. (then) Now. If you don't mind. I have an appointment with the mayor...
GILES: You can't keep her out of this school.
SNYDER: I think you'll find I can.
GILES: You had no grounds for expelling her.
SNYDER: I have grounds, I have precedent, and this tingly kind of --
GILES: It won't hold. Buffy Summers is a minor and entitled to a public education. Your personal distaste for the girl does not legally enable you --
SNYDER: Why don't you take it up with the city council?
GILES: I thought I'd start with the State supreme court. You may be powerful in local circles, but I believe I can make life very uncomfortable for you. Professionally speaking. And Buffy Summers will be allowed back in.
SNYDER: Sorry. I'm not convinced.
GILES: Do you want me to convince you?
WILLOW: I mean I'm not like a full fledged witch,  that takes years. I just did a couple of  pagan blessings and teeny glamour to  hide a zit.
BUFFY: It doesn't scare you?
WILLOW: It has. I tried to communicate with the spirit world and I so wasn't ready for that. It was like being pulled apart inside. Plus I blew the power for our whole block. Big scare.
BUFFY: Oh, I wish I coulda been there  with you.
WILLOW: Me too. I really freaked out.
BUFFY: I'm sorry...
WILLOW: It's okay. Really, I understand you having to bail and I can forgive that.  I have to make allowances for what  you're going through and just be a  grown up about it.
BUFFY: You're loving this moral superiority thing.
WILLOW: It's like a drug.
BUFFY: Fine. I'm the bad, I can take my lumps.  For a while.
WILLOW: All right, I'll stop giving you a hard time. (beat) Runaway.
BUFFY: Will...
WILLOW: I'm sorry. (beat) Quitter.
BUFFY: (beat) Whiner.
WILLOW: Bailer.
BUFFY: Harpy.
WILLOW: Delinquent.
BUFFY: Tramp.
