Mom-
Sorry, I-
(trying) It's, um, really... I think I'd go with  the hole.
It's angry at the room. It wants the room to suffer.
If... if it's okay. I want to find Willow  and Xander.
Not unless they give me lip.
I was until that four course snack you served me after dinner...
Mom, if you don't want me to go...
Thanks.
Didn't anyone tell you about playing with pointy sticks? It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye.
Oh. Go ahead.
No, it's-
Nighthawk?
Hey.
Are you sure it's not too late? Maybe  we should come back tomorrow.
What if he's mad?
Yeah, I just got in a few hours ago.  Went to see Mom first...
I pretty much remembered the address.
It's a long story.
What he said.
I noticed. You guys seemed down with the slayage. All tricked out with the walkies and everything -
Thanks for the offer, but I kind of want to get back to my routine. You know - slaying, school, kid stuff... You guys up for hanging tomorrow? I'm jonesing for some brainless fun.
What about you, Will?
Come on. Friends don't let friends browse alone.
On it. Mom's making an appointment with his ugliness.
(covering her worry) No problem. I'm bringing The Intimidator. One look at "Mom Face" and I know he'll break.
Let's go, Mom.
(horrified) Like with the jackets and kilts? You want me to get field-hockey-knees?
How about home schooling? It's not just for scary religious people anymore.
Thanks...
Actually-
Pat wishes us quality time.
Book Club. Got it.
Where was she?
Was there a message?
It'll be fun.
Mom. Willow and everybody aren't company plate people. They're normal plate people.
So how come that works on me - but not on other people?
Next time? I get to pick the mother/daughter bonding activity...
What? Thanks for stopping by and dying?
I thought they would be here.
Am I dreaming?
I'm afraid.
Mom-
A girl's school? Okay - so now it's jackets, kilts and no boys? Care to throw in a little foot binding?
Mom. Please. I'm a slayer. It's not like  I have to ride the little bus to school.
Welcome to the Hellmouth petting zoo.
I told mom, get the Forest Pine or the  April Fresh - but she wanted dead cat.
You know I love art talk as much as the next very dull person - but Giles,  shouldn't we go? We're in research mode.
Oh. (embarrassed) This marks a first. I want to go to school - but school doesn't want me.
You want to see my mother?
MOM!
Uh, hey.
(stunned) The band?
Hey!
This is... large!
It's great. It's just - I was thinking  more, just us. The gang?
This is amazing. But I still want to hang with just-
Is everything okay? You seem to be... I don't know - avoiding me. In the one-on-one sense.
So - we're cool?
Okay.
Don't mind me. I was just - taking a break from all that wacky fun.
Yeah. Seems like people I don't even know missed me. (then) Did Giles say if he was going to be late?
Okay. So. I'll just...
It's not like anyone'll mind.
Why are you attacking me? I'm trying --
I'm just trying to make things easier.
You guys seemed to be doing fine without me.
Look, I'm sorry I had to leave, okay? You don't know what I was going through.
You wouldn't understand.
While you're avoiding me like a virulent ebola strain?
Willow, I know you were worried, but --
Mom - can you just - Willow and I are talking-
I wasn't. I mean, I'm not sure what-
Stop! Just - stop! I don't know. Okay?  I don't know what I'm doing.
Mom. Please-
Mom-
But you told me! You're the one who said I should go. You said - "if you leave this house, don't come back." You found out who I really am and you couldn't deal - remember?
Punish you? I didn't do this to punish you-
(exasperated) Great. Would anybody else care to weigh in? What about you? By the dip.
Okay - I screwed up! I know it - alright!?  But you have no idea. You have no idea  what happened to me or what I was feeling-
What's the point? There was nothing anyone could do. I just had to deal on my own.
As if I could have gone to you, Xander.  You made your feelings about me and  Angel pretty clear-
(interrupting) Cordy. Get out of my shoes.
(overloaded) Will, just - stop, okay? I can't --
(to Xander) God, Xander! Do you think you could stick to annoying me on your own behalf?!
Let's talk acting like an idiot - "Nighthawk"!
Xander! The kitchen!
I don't think so-
Nope. Not vampires.
I know. Try to get him back outside-
Help me barricade. Come on!
Great. Good job every-
Upstairs!
Don't look, Willow!
No!
Not looking. Not looking...
Hey - Pat!
Made you look.
Mom-
This? No. (only half-kidding) This was nothing.
You too.
It doesn't scare you?
Oh, I wish I coulda been there  with you.
I'm sorry...
You're loving this moral superiority thing.
Fine. I'm the bad, I can take my lumps.  For a while.
Will...
(beat) Whiner.
Harpy.
Tramp.
