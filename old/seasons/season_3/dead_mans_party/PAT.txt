Oh my word, you must be Buffy!  Look at you - aren't you a picture?
(shaking Buffy's hand enthusiastically) I'm Pat - from your mother's book club? I'm sure she mentioned me.
I sort of took it upon myself to look after her while you were, you know, off and away or what have you. Between your "situation" and reading "Deep End of the Ocean" she was just a wreck. You can imagine.
Well, I'm off. We're making empanadas in my Spanish class tonight. You go be with your mother. The two of you need to re-bond.
There you are. Not thinking about any more flights of fancy, I hope? (not giving Buffy a chance to reply) Joyce said there was room for one more - so I said "forget facial night -  let's party!" I bet you like empanadas.
Please.
Now - how are you holding up, Joyce? Really?
But?
I live. (looking at the others) You die.
