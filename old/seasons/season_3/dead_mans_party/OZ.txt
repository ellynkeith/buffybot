Looks dead. Smells dead. But moving around. Interesting.
I like him. I think you should call him Patches.
Well - let's figure it out. What kind of  deal is this? Is it a gathering, a shin dig  or a hootenanny?
A gathering. Brie and mellow song stylings. Shin dig. Dip - (he nods to Cordelia) Less mellow song stylings. Perhaps a large amount of malt beverage. And a hootenanny... just chock full of hoot and a little bit of nanny.
Yeah. I think I could supply some Dingo action.
Hootenanny.
Okay. Stepping in now. Being referee guy-
This way!
I think the dead man's party has moved upstairs.
What happens if they get the mask?
Buffy!
Never mind.
