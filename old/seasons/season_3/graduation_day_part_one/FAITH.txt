Hi, I'm looking for Professor Worth?
Oh, I'm not from the college. I work  for Mayor Wilkins. I'm Faith.
He's a big fan, Professor.
We alone here, Lester?
I hear that. You wanna turn and face  the wall, Lester.
I'll make it quick.
Who wouldn't
Sorry, friend. Boss wants you dead.
You know, I never thought to ask.
I feel wicked stupid in this.
Yeah, but it's not really me.
I hope I don't let you down.
Meant to.
He's dropped, boss.
Right in the back -- He pitches over  and Buffy's freaking, looking around  all panicked... it was a good time.
What next?
Ingest?
You're wicked gross.
You gotta give me something to do.  There's no way I'm sleeping. Don't  you need anyone dead? Or maimed?  I can settle for maimed.
My mom called me that. When I was  little. I was always running around...
So you'll still need me in there.
When I was a kid, a couple miles outside  of Boston there was this quarry, kids  used to swim there. Jump off the rocks...  There was one rock like forty feet up,  I was the only one that would jump it.  All the older kids were too scared.
Nah. I could do it easy.
Good luck with your spiders there.
(smiles) Is he dead yet?
Uh-huh. Mayor got me the poison.  Said it was wicked painful.
Damn. What is it?
You come here to get me? Gonna  feed me to Angel?
Well, look at you, all dressed up in  big sister's clothes.
You ready to cut loose?
Okay then. Give us a kiss.
That's mine.
Man, I'm gonna miss this...
