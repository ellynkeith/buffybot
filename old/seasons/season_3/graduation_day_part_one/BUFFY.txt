Don't you hate her?
Well, I think it's contagious. The whole  senior class has turned into... the 60's.  Or, what I imagine the 60's to have  been like, except without the war and  the hairy armpits.
I don't. I mean, I'll miss stuff, but  graduating just isn't that big of a deal  to me. You get a piece of paper and  nothing changes. I don't even think  I'm gonna go.
Ascension? Mayor becoming demon,  snacking upon populace? I was  planning to fight him.
Fight the Mayor and go to graduation.
Hear what?
I don't believe this.
The Mayor at graduation. A hundred  helpless kids to feed on. He got any  other surprises for us?
Faith.
This is one of her pieces. I recognize  the brushwork.
Doesn't read. I think this is homework.
Which leads to the question, "how  come?" I'm about to destroy the entire  city but I take the time to kill Harmless  Lester first?
Then I wanna know too. If the Mayor's  trying to hide, I say we go seek.
What page are you on, Wes? We got  there already.
I just love it when you take charge,  you man, you.
I'll go.
I don't think she will. Been there, killed  that; she's not much for follow up.
'Cause I'm not crazy or 'cause I don't  kill people?
I hear you. I can't kill her... fun though  it sounds... I don't have that in me. I can  make her cry uncle, though, and I mean to.
Stopping Faith IS my work. Take a beat  to love the synergy.
Cut back to the chase.
Excuse me, killing them professionally  for four years running...
How?
What about the spiders? Mayor had a  box of spiders he had to eat. The box  of, of... I wanna say gravlax --
Well, there must be something you  remember that isn't --
You never get even a little tired of  hearing yourself talk, do you?
Get out.
Mom, I need you to leave town. Tonight.
That's kind of the point.
(zipping the case) Mom, graduation is a pointless ceremony  where you sit around and listen to boring  speeches till you get a little piece of paper  that says you graduated which you already  know and dark blue does nothing for my  complexion so don't argue, okay?
Just promise me you'll be far away from here.
You know I can't.
Mom... I know sometimes you wish  I was different.
And I wish I could be a lot of things  for you, a great student, big athlete,  remotely normal... I'm not. But there's  something I do that I do better than  anybody else in the world. I'm gonna  fight this thing. But I can't do that and  worry about you.
You stay, you'll get me killed. You  have to trust me. Can you do that?
That was stealthy.
What are you doing here?
He's worried I'll run into Faith.
Gonna happen sooner or later.
A report, excavation of some old lava  bed. Guy was a volcano-ologist or something.
Well, I looked through it, and the only  things I understood were the commas.  I'm gonna take some of this stuff to  Giles, see if he can do better.
Okay. Thanks. I can take it from here.
I really don't require an escort, okay?  Big girl, super powers... I don't need  you crowding me.
Of course not! You show up at the prom  and then just disappear into the ozone.  I didn't even know if you were still in town.
Duh -- yes.
What?
No, you don't. Not anymore.
Could you stop with the brainteasers?  I'm just... I wish it was over. Done.
I know. World in peril and we've got  to work together. Well, this is my last  office romance, I'll tell you that.
Isn't it even a little hard for you?
(speaking over him) Oh, it's so nice to know what you  really think of me!
(over him) I just don't wanna do this anymore! I  can't have you in my life when I'm trying to --
On three. One...
I'm just glad Faith's aim is so sucky.
Well, I've narrowed down our list of  one suspect...
I'm not fascinated yet.
Great. And all we need is a million  tons of burning lava. We're saved.
Jeez, you're a klutz today. You better take it easy until --
Angel, you're burning up.
You think the guys can find out what  this is?
Thanks. (to Angel) You're gonna be okay.
It's okay... you'll be okay...
Couldn't?
Try again.
I'm talking about watching my lover  die. I have no clue what you're talking  about and I do not care.
Orders?
They're in England! I don't think they  can tell which way my back is facing.
Go back to your Council --
Go and tell them that until the next  Slayer shows up they can close up shop.  I'm not working for them anymore.
I have strategy. You're not in it.
I like to think of it as graduation.
You'll watch him?
Get a job.
And the cure?
But there's some.
Be sure.
Nothing?
WHAT?
Good.
No, it's perfect. Angel needs to drain  a Slayer? I'll bring him one.
Not if she's already dead.
Some of you guys should relieve  Giles after a while. Watch over Angel.
It's time.
I can't play kid games anymore. This  is how she wants it.
I won't get hurt.
Just get me an address.
I thought I'd stop by.
He's not gonna die. Good try, though.  "A" for effort. Your plan?
There's a cure.
Your blood.
That's not a problem.
You told me I was just like you, Faith.  That I was only holding it in.
Try me.
Stick around.
What's the matter? All that killing  and you're afraid to die?
You're about to get it back.
No...
