Ow.
Not my best entrance... I think they  were mopping in the hall.
I checked in with Giles, he asked me  to back you up.
You're not?
What's that?
Anything in there that connects him  to the Mayor?
Let me give you a hand.
That's all right. I'll walk you there.
Didn't think I was.
(confused) Are you mad at me for being around  too much or for not being around enough?
Which?
I don't get you.
Are you just making this harder to  make it easier on yourself?
It's not that simple. When the Mayor --
You want me out of your face?
How can you ask me that? Just 'cause  I'm not acting like a brat doesn't mean  I don't feel anything--
(over her) What do you expect me to say if you attack --
Yeah.
(through gritted teeth) I knew you were gonna do that...
I heal pretty fast. Should be all right.
(standing weakly) A demon?
It's a start, anyway. If we can --
Damn.
My shoulder's completely numb. It's  poison. I can feel it.
Buffy...
