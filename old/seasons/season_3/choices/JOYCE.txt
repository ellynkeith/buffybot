When were you going to tell me?
You were accepted to  Northwestern University? (hugging her) Honey, I'm so proud of you.  That's wonderful.
I mean, it isn't cheap, but I know  we can make it work if your  Father pitches in. Not that  Northwestern's your only option;  it's a great school, though. I'm so  <b>proud</b> of you.
And will again soon.
Oh, I know, sweetheart. I'm just  so pleased you have so many  choices. Oo, my cousin Arlene  and her family are in Illinois. I've  got to call and tell them.
Don't forget to put my earrings  back in my dresser before you go out.
