I'll service you, toygirl.
Say hello to your new home, boys!
So I figured what better way to  kick off our semi-settling down  than with a little christening ...
All in one, quick, really REALLY violent, fell swoop...
Bye-bye, Slayer.
Another one for the fire, boys ...
Welcome home, Slayer. Alive and kicking after all.
Big axe you got there.
So you got a witch in the mix.
Now, my boys, see ... that's tricky. They came looking for a massacre. And I think you got exactly enough magic between you for a kiddies birthday party.
Whoah. I better back off or you might pull a rabbit out of a hat.
Of course we want trouble. We're demons. We're really all about trouble.
I get your point.
Now what kind of a Slayer is it runs out on her buddies ... just when they need her most.
You're next. First you. Then those bitch friends of--
So. Witch. Got a little power after all.
