Less talk, more running away.
Somebody should tell them that.
No! Bad plan!
But ... (a thought) The Buffybot ...
Was that necessary? A simple "psst" would've been--
(distracted) Did he say "stores?" "Hitting stores?" Does he mean looting?
They can't loot the magic shop. Not now. I just got it.
You don't think they'll cause a lot of damage, do you?
Thank God...
Xander...
Then where are they? Why aren't they here yet?
What if they're hurt? Xander could  be lying somewhere. All broken  and bleeding. Calling my name--
Like that! Or -- oh --
How do you--
(wanting to believe) You think?
(a new concern) The woods? We're going back to the woods? I hate the woods. All those woodsy trees--
With yoga?
Already been looted! Sorry! Try  the appliance store at the end of the  block! They've got pretty... um, toasters--
Xander!
Um. Question. You want us to go back out there?
It's just ... Well, we're minus one  Buffybot. And Spike is missing in  action somewhere with Dawn. And  Giles flew away. And you look a  little magicked out ...
Just ... How are we supposed to fight these guys?
I'm not saying we announce it this second...
I think it will please them to know we're engaged. And I think Willow, in particular, could use a morale booster right now.
It's just that... Well, all the excuses for not telling anyone we're engaged are gone now. I mean, apart from hell-bikers, there's nothing hanging over us anymore. This is it. No more surprises.
Where did--?
What's wrong with her?
(gently) Hey, Buffy, here's some good news that might perk you right up. Xander and I have an announcement--
What?! I'm trying to help.  XANDER Buffy. It's going to be all right. We ... We brought you back. You're home now.
Plus we have a Slayer here (looking at feral Buffy) who might actually be looking to eat some brains so, I think a quiet moseying, no hard feelings and I'm sure your demon horde won't think any the less of you...
(to the girls, terrified) Don't do that! Why would you do that?
Does this mean we win?
Where's she going?
Xander! Look out!
(moving to him) Xander!
