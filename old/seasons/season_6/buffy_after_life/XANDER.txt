Absolutely.
Hey, I've done a lot of fleeing  through these mean streets.  I know all the short-cuts.
Hey, hey, don't worry, ladies,  I'll get us there just fine. My  senses are primed for danger,  and nothing's gonna HOLY CRAP!
(shaky) I'm okay. (counts silently) Four. Four limbs. Doing good.
Yeah, now that their leader's  gone they seem to be making  with the big skedaddle.
What? Where?
What do you remember?
How long were you gone? I mean, how long for you?
She just got back. Give her time.  I bet, in a week, she'll be our little Bufferin again.
Who's that? Spike?
Ow!
Well, now you know.
We didn't tell you. It was ... we just didn't, okay? Maybe you should  stop being a problem for a second  and just be glad that she's back..
What are you talking about? Willow couldn't do that!
Look, you're just covering. You can't  tell me you're not happy. Look me in  the eyes. Tell me that seeing Buffy  alive wasn't the happiest damn second  of your whole existence.
Huh? What? Do what? (into phone) Hello?
Attacked? A vampire?
(intense) In the house? All right. Willow. You  need to get out of there. Get everyone out.
It was very bad. Very very very very very very bad. Bad.
A hitchhiker?
What?
Witch-witch?
Okay, fine. But what are we going to  do? I mean, I'm feeling the need for  some vigorous doing, you know?
Can we do that? Kill it?
Buff?
Yeah. This thing, this haunting thing,  we'll fix it, and then we'll still have you  back, which is ... it's so important.
(explaining) Demons that might have come out of Hell at the same time Buffy did.
So should we concentrate on how to  kill those or should we try to find more?
Do you want us to go with you?
Fire, fire, fire.
Is she okay?
Yeah. It's gone.
It's getting light out. Buffy's probably  on her way home from patrolling.
Mmmokay. (then, softly) Hey, Tara. This is probably crazy, but I was talking to Spike ...
Mmmokay again. But, thing is,  Spike made me think. The spell  we did. It's having consequences,  isn't it? I mean, it sure seems like it.  And I was wondering... did you know  this might happen?
Do you think... could someone have known?
I know, I know. Backing off quickly, see, hands in the air, I just mean--
We made a demon? Bad us.
So we need to uncreate it, right? Get it the rest of the way out of our world.
We will.
What is?
Thanks for the tip.
I can't!
I did not send the demon -- I was possessed! The demon used me to eavesdrop on our conversation-
Good-gay idea-yay, An-ya-ay
It's okay, Dawnie. Willow and Tara are doing a spell.
No, of course not. It's just that she  can't fight this thing while it's all ...  misty. So they make it more solid,  and then Buffy can kick its newly- corporeal ass.
You bet. Piece of cake.
Ooph.
You get Dawn off to school okay?  Cuz I was thinking if you need me  to pick her up--
Welcome home, Buffy.
