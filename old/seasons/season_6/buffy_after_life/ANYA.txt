I don't like this.
Oh! Xander!
At least the demons almost  hit you on the way out of town.
Sure, from what I saw before  she ran off in a completely  not-like-her way. Other than that  she was exactly Buffy.
I was being sarcastic. I think we  screwed it up and she's broken.
And you think of this <u>now</u>?
She's here!
A hell-dimension. Same torture, less religion. (to Buffy) What was it like?
Mmm. Saucy. Buffy likes pizza.
Well, yeah. The jet-lag from hell has  gotta be, you know, the jet-lag from hell.
(to Xander) I think Willow's wrong. I don't think she's especially normal at all.
Oh yes, because six or seven days,  that's really all you need to get over  eternal hell experiences.
Hey!
Um... thank you and please stop pressing against my boyfriend?
(softly) Xander? Are you up? I can't sleep. Play a word game with me.
(re: Xander) He's all traumatized.
I bet it's a hitchhiker.
Standard way to travel between  alternate dimensions. Some  thing-ama-demon sees someone  moving between worlds, and grabs  on for the ride.
I think we shouldn't've brought Buffy  back. I knew it was going to go badly.  I should've said something.
They're hitchhikers, not highjackers,  and I thought you knew! It's basic  stuff! You're supposed to be the  all-powerful witch, which--
Witch, which raises the question,  why are you having us skulk around  and meet in the backyard like ...  like conspiracy squirrels? Sitting on  this arm is making my buttocks hurt.
It's all right if you're still plagued with  nightmarish visions of Hell.
A demon you brought back from Hell with you.
Maybe you are! Because of Hell!  (Off Willow's glare, meekly) No. You're fine.
Can we go somewhere with cushions? Let's go somewhere with cushions.
Possible hitchhikers.
That just means they prefer eating things with little bones. (beat) Like you.
That's four. What's the other one like?
We could do that.
I found a 24-hour place for coffee.  Remember that bookstore? Well  they became one of those books-and- coffee places and now they're just  coffee. It's like evolution only without  the getting-better part.
(quickly) You can have my coffee.
(sadly) I liked that cushion.
Did I look like that? I hope I didn't look like that.
I bet you experience some dry-mouth. (explaining) Fire.
Yes. But where did it go? I mean, evil  things have plans. They have things to do.
She's possessed!
Technically, that's not a price. That's a gift with purchase.
He's right. Return the unwanted gift.  Metaphorically it works out exactly right.
Dawn--
What? Why are you smiling? (to Xander) That's inappropriate.
She's right. You're like a snail. A  snail that is driving a car very slowly. (urgent) Come on! Give it the lead foot! We've  got to help Buffy with that demon you  sent after her!
Great. So now what? We can only talk in anti-demon secret code?
Right. Easy peasy. (under breath/to Xander) Hurry.
Oh.
