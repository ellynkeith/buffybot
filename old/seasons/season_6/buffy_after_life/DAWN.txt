Home! See?
Home again, home again... (weakly) Jiggety jog.
A little. Willow and Tara  live here now, and we ... we  didn't do much...
There you are. Knew you were  under that dirt somewhere.  Remember what Mom used to  say? "Either wash that neck or  plant potatoes."
I'll do the shirt. Then we can do your hands ...
Mom's room. I know it's really different now.
Yeah, well. It seemed like it made  sense. No one was using it, and it's  the biggest. But, you know, now that you're back, we'll have to figure out  what to do ...
You mean, with the house, or...
What what?
I dunno... It'll be interesting.  We could do it now, put you  on the phone, "Hi, Giles, guess  who this is?" Give him a heart attack.
It's okay.
See? It's just Spike. (calls) I'm here!
Spike.
Look.
She's kind of-- She's been through a lot,  with the ... death. But I think she's okay.
Me? Nothing!
I was gonna fix 'em. I don't know how they got like that.
'kay.
Got the stuff.
(to the others) You knew she was back? How did you know?
Hey!
Back off! Let her breathe!
You did this. What did you do?
Is she going to be okay?
What are you saying? Are you saying she was somewhere? Like, in hell?
No! She shouldn't have to talk about it!
Guys. Back off.
Yeah. Yes. It's your room.
What's the list?
(reads) Skaggmore demons, Trellbane demons, Skitterers, Large and Small Bone- Eaters ...
Eww.
You should go.
<u>Idiot</u>.
<u>All of you did it, Stupid children,  Did you think the blood wouldn't  reach you? I smell the death on you,  LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE!</u>
What happened? What's going on?
Was it ... did the demon thing have me?
(to Anya) You're right.
What?
If you made a demon how come  we don't see it? I mean, we just  see us. Doing stuff.
(softly) Like it never brought Buffy back.
You can't do that. You can't think for  a second that you're going to do that.
If you think you can give her back to  me and then take her away again... No.  That's worse than if you'd never brought  her back. You can't mess with people's  lives this way! What about what would  happen to her? You'd send her back to  where she was, hell or whatever?
How can you let her do this? How can  you even talk about letting her go? I  thought you loved her too!
Then do it!
Xander! Drive faster!
I could drive faster and I can't drive!
Stop talking in wrong Pig Latin and drive! Buffy's in trouble!
It's not gonna send Buffy away, is it?
You sure it'll work?
Buffy! Kill it!
Huh. That's probably the sort of thing I'm not s'posed to see, right?
What's wrong?
You made me lunch?
Wow. Thanks.
Thank you.
Everyone's been doing that, huh?
They care about you a lot. When  you were gone ... it was bad when  you were gone. But it'll get better  now. Now that they can see you  being happy. That's all they want.
