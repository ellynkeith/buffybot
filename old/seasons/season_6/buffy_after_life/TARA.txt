This is the fastest way?
You're sure?
Yeah.
What are you thinking, Willow?  That she's ... that she's not right?  Or maybe, like, dangerous?
Are you okay?
What do you know about what  happened?
Oh, Buffy, I'm so sorry.
That's a good idea. You should sleep.
Did you get through to London?
How'd he take it?
Are you worried?
Hey, Will. This is me. It doesn't all  have to be "good" and "fine." This is  the room where you don't have to  be brave and I still love you. If you're  worried you can be worried.
Buffy isn't like that.
But?
Yeah? Let me hear?
Wow. I have this voice that says you're not gonna get much sleep  tonight.
You know what I think? I think we  were all assume-crash-positions.
It's, it's, it's like ... we were all  tensed up, like we were expecting  it to screw up. We weren't prepared  for it to actually go right.
(sleepy) Yeah?
I'm sure she is.
You thought she'd say thanks? Be more grateful?
Give her time. She'll get there.
Exactly.
I'm sure it's okay.
Oh God, oh God, oh God.
No glass. There's no glass.
Maybe we dreamed it.
Oh, yeah. (beat) What was it talking about? Did you understand it?
There's, there's something in the house.
I don't know.
Like she was possessed.
Not anymore.
Assume crash positions.
Nothing.
We want her to get all the rest she can.
Yah!
How are you feeling? Are you okay?
You shouldn't worry about it.
How did they change?
It's wonderful.
Kinda like the others, only dripping with viscous fluid.
Dawn!
It's okay. It's okay.
I like sunrise better when I'm getting up  early than when I'm staying up late, you  know? It's like I'm seeing it from the wrong side.
(smiling) Really? You two mix about as well as Satyrion seed and powdered turtledove.
No!
Willow's a talented witch and she'd never do anything to hurt anyone.
It doesn't have a body... so it's  borrowing ours ... It borrowed  Dawn and Anya ...
It's using them to do stuff. To scare us, attack us.
We do. Honey, you're not listening. She said we'll find another way.
It would live if it killed Buffy?
Child of words, hear thy makers.  Child of words, we entreat.  With our actions did we make thee,  to our voices wilt thou bend...
With our potions thou took motive,  with our motions came to pass.  We rescind no past devotions,  give thee substance, give thee mass. (repeating... ) Child of words, hear thy makers ...
It was Willow. She knew what to do.
