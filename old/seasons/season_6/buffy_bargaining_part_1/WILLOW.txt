I don't know. I was trying to program  in some new puns and I kind of ended  up with word salad.
It's a glitch. I'll fix it.
And I will therefore fix it. I got her  head back on, didn't I? And I got her  off the knock knock jokes ...
Where's my clog? I think there's a clog-eating monster under the bed.
Hey Dawn. Are you up?
Besides terror about today and a general feeling of impending doom? Swell.
Pancakes could go in bellies ...
Dawny!
(to Buffybot) Morning. I was thinking we could go over your programming again...
Help yourself. Really. (then) So what brings you so early, your macho-ness?
Hello? Hey Anya. Really? That's fantastic ...
(listens/then) And you're her Sweet Cookie Face.
Maybe you should just let the machine -  the... other machine - get the phone  from now on, okay?
Actually, we've got bigger worries than her fighting skills today.
I'm serious, Xander. Buffybot is about  to face her most dangerous challenge ever.
You really found it.
(alarmed) You used a Magic Box supplier? What if Giles finds out?
It's the one.
I am.
Just about.
Tomorrow night. We'll meet here at--
And it's time to stop talking.  Tomorrow night, we're bringing  Buffy back.
Guys. I need you guys on board here.
Nobody's changing their minds. Period.
I can do this, Xander. I promise. But not without you.
No. No one else can know. Not  Giles, not Spike, not Dawn. They  might not understand--
I'm telling you it won't.
This isn't Zombies, Xander.
This isn't like Dawn trying to bring back  Mrs. Summers or anything we've dealt  with before . Buffy didn't die a natural  death. She was killed by mystical energy.
It means more than that. It means we don't know where she really is.
(getting worked up) Her body, yeah, but her soul, her  essence -- that could be somewhere  else, trapped it some Hell dimension  like Angel was. Suffering some eternal  torment that we can't even imagine  just because she saved us and I am  not gonna let her... (near tears) ...I'm not gonna leave her there.
What happened? Where's Dawn?
Looks more like a short in the navigational system. (to Spike) Can you get me the flashlight? It's in the kitchen.
Good thinking-
I know. Still, just this once it was  a good idea to stay put. Spike was right.
I did. I mean, I thought I got all that stuff out of the program-
Sure. I mean I've got a lot of work here, but I'll see what I can do.
No. It's not your fault.
That's not true. He thinks you're swell.
He just gets cranky. Like vampires do. (then) Now just relax...
Adonai, Helomi, Pine... Adonai,  Helomi, Pine... The gods do command  thee from thy majesty...
Oh, I had to get that thing.
The last spell ingredient.
"Wine of the Mother." Kind of... black market stuff.
Sorry. I didn't ... I was careful.
All I know is - we have to have it to  do the spell. Which makes it good  stuff in my book.
You got butterflies, baby?
Tell the bats it's going to be alright.  I promise. We couldn't be more prepared.
What?
Like we'd make a scene.
We just wanted you to know we'll  be okay. We'll miss you - but we'll  be okay.
Now? God, we just made it...
(near tears) Maybe you shouldn't. I'm trying to be stiff-upper-lippy.
You'd better get going. Don't you have a life or something?
There he goes.
(distressed) It was right, though, wasn't it? Giving  him the no-tears send-off ... We don't  want him going off all worried about us.
What's he going to do over there  by himself? He never talks about  people in England. What if he's lonely?
I know. I was hoping we'd figure it out before he left.
He'll come back.
Let's get Dawn home. I want to go  over everything one more time.  Nothing can go wrong tonight.
Does everybody have their candles?
Well, make it stay. It has to-
Come on, Anya. Do you have it?
Start the circle. Now.
Osiris! Here lies the warrior of the people! Let her cross over!
Osiris! Let her cross over!
Osiris! Release her!
No!!
Did it work?
