(catching her breath) I thought ... the big ones tire more easily...
It's Sobri root! It's supposed to confuse him but it kinda just made  him peppy. It's not supposed to  mix with anything -- do you think  he might be taking prescription medication?
Is that the one with the cute little gargoyle--
Yeah. She says that pie thing every time she stakes a vamp now.
The only really real Buffy - is really... Buffy.
I believe that's a Dawn Monster. She borrowed them yesterday.
You doing okay?
Breakfast will make all things better.
(to Will) Again? You've done all you can, sweetie. She's either ready to face  this thing or she's not-
Oh, I don't know that we're "mega." Maybe Willow. But-
Oh! Oops. She wanted to help.  I got her started but then I forgot  to un-start...
You got funny shapes anyway. Sorry.
Just a Scooby meeting. Spike'll be here with you.
It's perfect. It's just, we can't take the  chance that Mr. Summers might talk  to you and know something's wrong.
Way bigger. 
The Urn of Osiris.
(disbelieving) You found the last known Urn of Osiris on E-Bay?

You said 'Willow should be boss.'
You made her that little plaque that  said 'BOSS OF US,' you put on sparkles--
And if something does go wrong--
Which means we do have a shot.
Hey. You're late.
Black market? You didn't tell me that.  You shouldn't have gone alone. It could have been dangerous.
It's better that we're together.
More like bats.
That's okay. Thanks.
I know. I just wish it was time. I can't stand worrying about it anymore.
And a monster. Kind of a Sunnydale souvenir, we thought. Grrrr. Argggh.
He won't be lonely. He lived there before, remember?
We'll call him tomorrow. How about that? See how his flight was ...
(to Xander) What time is it?
No. She told me... She'd be tested.  This is what's supposed to happen-
Xander. She's strong. She said not  to stop, no matter what. If anything  b-b-breaks the cycle now - it-s over-
Oh God... Oh, God...
Willow-
