SPIKE: Come on! I'm never gonna get anything killed with you lot holding me back!
TARA: (catching her breath) I thought ... the big ones tire more easily...
SPIKE: No, that's over-the-hill shopkeepers.
GILES: I'm fine. I just need to need to... die ... for a minute...
SPIKE: (to Tara) It was that powder you blew at him made him rabbit out.
TARA: It's Sobri root! It's supposed to confuse him but it kinda just made  him peppy. It's not supposed to  mix with anything -- do you think  he might be taking prescription medication?
SPIKE: ("you're an idiot") Yeah. That must be it.
GILES: (riffing) Good God. What if he attempts to operate heavy machinery?!
SPIKE: (also amused) We could all be--
GILES: Van Elton?
TARA: Is that the one with the cute little gargoyle--
SPIKE: Well how--
BUFFY: Big, fast and dumb. Just the way I like 'em.
XANDER: Uh oh. Sounds like the other units are engaged...
XANDER: Great googely moogely Willow you've got to quit doing that!
XANDER: But not the lay of my brain!
ANYA: It is kind of intrusive. You could knock first or something.
XANDER: I know, I know. I don't have to talk  when I answer you. But I saw The Fury  and that way lies spooky carnival death-
XANDER: Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
GILES: (breathless) S-Spike!
SPIKE: I did.
GILES: You might have let me in on your plan while he throttled me.
SPIKE: Oooh. Poor watcher. Did your life  pass before your eyes? "Cuppa tea,  cuppa tea, almost got shagged, cuppa tea..."
BUFFY: I got it!
SPIKE: What's with the Dadaism, Red?
TARA: Yeah. She says that pie thing every time she stakes a vamp now.
WILLOW: I don't know. I was trying to program  in some new puns and I kind of ended  up with word salad.
BUFFYBOT: (brightly) I think it's funny.
WILLOW: It's a glitch. I'll fix it.
GILES: We just can't have her messing up  in front of the wrong person -- or  the wrong thing. We need the world and the underworld -- to believe  Buffy is alive and well.
WILLOW: And I will therefore fix it. I got her  head back on, didn't I? And I got her  off the knock knock jokes ...
BUFFYBOT: Ooh! Who's there?
XANDER: You know, if we want to be exactly--
SPIKE: She'll never be exactly.
XANDER: I know.
TARA: The only really real Buffy - is really... Buffy.
GILES: And she's gone.
BUFFYBOT: (continuing the knock knock joke) If we want her to be exactly she'll  never be exactly I know the only really real Buffy is really Buffy  and she's gone who?
WILLOW: Where's my clog? I think there's a clog-eating monster under the bed.
TARA: I believe that's a Dawn Monster. She borrowed them yesterday.
WILLOW: Hey Dawn. Are you up?
TARA: You doing okay?
WILLOW: Besides terror about today and a general feeling of impending doom? Swell.
TARA: Breakfast will make all things better.
WILLOW: Pancakes could go in bellies ...
WILLOW: Dawny!
DAWN: (full toothpaste mouth) I md't tke mrrclgs!
WILLOW: (to Buffybot) Morning. I was thinking we could go over your programming again...
TARA: (to Will) Again? You've done all you can, sweetie. She's either ready to face  this thing or she's not-
DAWN: Rounds are fine. (then) What's up with the Mega-witches?
TARA: Oh, I don't know that we're "mega." Maybe Willow. But-
DAWN: No, I mean, whose going to eat all that?
TARA: Oh! Oops. She wanted to help.  I got her started but then I forgot  to un-start...
XANDER: (important voice) House o' chicks, relax. I'm a man and I have a tool! (sees Dawn) Tools. Lots of plural tools. In my toolbox. (sees something) Many sandwiches! Excellent. Men like sandwiches.
WILLOW: Help yourself. Really. (then) So what brings you so early, your macho-ness?
XANDER: I got that soldering wire you wanted. For Buffybot's tune-up.
TARA: You got funny shapes anyway. Sorry.
BUFFYBOT: I'll get it-
DAWN: No!
DAWN: It could be my dad. He said he'd call today.
BUFFYBOT: I'll just say hello. He's my biological ancestor.
WILLOW: Hello? Hey Anya. Really? That's fantastic ...
XANDER: She did? Great.
WILLOW: (listens/then) And you're her Sweet Cookie Face.
XANDER: (coolly) I go by many names ...
DAWN: What's tonight?
TARA: Just a Scooby meeting. Spike'll be here with you.
WILLOW: Maybe you should just let the machine -  the... other machine - get the phone  from now on, okay?
BUFFYBOT: Is my phone manner not correct?
TARA: It's perfect. It's just, we can't take the  chance that Mr. Summers might talk  to you and know something's wrong.
XANDER: If he thought that the real Buffy was gone, he could take Dawn away.
DAWN: And I want to stay here. With you and Willow and Tara. Understand?
BUFFYBOT: I do. I want you to stay as well. You're my sister.
XANDER: So excellent. We're agreed. Sit  your roboself down so we can get  to work. We need to fix up those  fighting skills, pronto.
WILLOW: Actually, we've got bigger worries than her fighting skills today.
TARA: Way bigger. 
XANDER: I guess. Depends how highly you prize punning.
WILLOW: I'm serious, Xander. Buffybot is about  to face her most dangerous challenge ever.
DAWN: (to Buffybot) Okay. we'll make a quick lap so  people can see you're here, then we'll-
BUFFYBOT: What is this?
DAWN: This is our city of the future. I made  the hover cars. They're orange juice  cans, see?
BUFFYBOT: They're very nice. But I don't understand...
TEACHER: We're reading Walden. This is the  kids version of a utopian society.  You'll notice there are no schools and an extraordinary number of pizza parlors.
BUFFYBOT: I don't know of a breed of humans this small. Who's going to live here?
DAWN: Oh, God. She's always like this.
LEFCORT: (mid-speech) ... as you can see, we provide the best  in progressive learning. But we can't  teach your child unless you do. As parents, you have a responsibility to  create the right attitude. To teach them  what school can mean-
BUFFYBOT: School is where you learn.
LEFCORT: <u>Exactly</u>. Parents let kids focus on  school as a social experience, rather  than a learning experience. We want  you to get your kids as excited about  education as they are about lunch hour-
BUFFYBOT: I helped make lunch today.
LEFCORT: Oh?
BUFFYBOT: Before school. Peanut butter and Jelly.  I don't eat, but Dawn takes one everyday-
GILES: (re: paper he's holding) Anya - this register report for January  looks off. Let's pull those files again.
ANYA: Are you mad at me?
GILES: Mad? No, I just-
ANYA: (cutting him off) Then why are you torturing me? I  punished someone like this, you know,  when I was demon. I made them  doublecheck spread sheets for all eternity.
GILES: I'm sorry if you resent my thoroughness,  but I won't be comfortable leaving here until-
ANYA: You're taking the Ramadan Effigy?
GILES: It's not inventory. It's part of my personal collection.
ANYA: Oh ho! Aren't you Mr. Dicey Semantics?  So now you can just take whatever you want?
GILES: No, you give it-
XANDER: Okay. When I'm marvelling at the immaturity? Be scared. (to Anya) Anya. Giles is leaving the store to you when he goes. What more do  you want?
GILES: I am not "leaving" the store to anyone.  I will be in England, not dead, and I'll  still be a partner-
ANYA: A silent, overseas partner-
XANDER: Who you should be very nice to  unless you want to end up working  at Video Hut.
ANYA: (contrite) I know. I know. It's just - he keeps  saying he's going and then he doesn't.  And I keep almost being in charge, and  then I'm not. And maybe he shouldn't  be going at all, but we can't talk about  that - and it all leaves me with this stress  and bossiness stored up and it just leaks out.
XANDER: Give it time, An. This is hard for all of us. You need to be patient.
ANYA: I was being patient but it took too long. I mean, I miss Buffy, I do. But life shouldn't just stop because  she's gone. I'm sick of waiting to take  over here and I'm sick of waiting to tell everyone about us.
XANDER: We've talked about this We can't announce our engagement while  things are so up in the air.
ANYA: Why not? It's happy news. Happy news in hard times is a good thing.
XANDER: It is, but ... If things go as planned -  everything could be different.  Let's just hold on.
ANYA: That's what you've been saying all summer-
XANDER: Please. Anya. We'll know more after we talk to Willow and Tara tonight.
ANYA: Fine. Whatever. Just remember, this  marriage thing was your idea. I  didn't ask to be all crazy.
DAWN: ... so my homeroom teacher, Ms. Lefcort?  Was like - "your sister is an example to  us all." She wanted to make it National  Buffy Day.
SPIKE: Makes sense.
DAWN: It does?
SPIKE: Yeah. She responded to Buffybot  because a robot is predictable, boring...  A perfect teacher's pet. That's all  schools are, you know, factories  spewing out mindless little automatons-- (quickly) -who go on to be very productive and valuable members of society. And you should go. Because Buffy would want you to.
DAWN: Check. One mindless automaton  coming up.
SPIKE: So what do you fancy, bit? Game a rummy?
DAWN: Willow and Tara said they'd be back early. You don't really have to hang.  I mean, if you're bored.
SPIKE: I'm not. And yeah I do.
DAWN: But I'm fine alone. It's not like  anyone's coming after me. I'm not  the key - or if I am, I don't open  anything anymore. It's over, remember?
SPIKE: I'm not going to leave you here by yourself. So forget it.
DAWN: I'm just saying-
SPIKE: No. I'm not leaving you to get hurt. Not again. (then) Now deal.
BUFFYBOT: (to victim) I'm going to kill him.
VAMP: Slayer...
BUFFYBOT: (still to victim) You can run away now.
VAMP: You're - you're a machine-
BUFFYBOT: Thank you...
TARA: The Urn of Osiris.
WILLOW: You really found it.
ANYA: It wasn't easy. I went through every  supplier The Magic Box has.
WILLOW: (alarmed) You used a Magic Box supplier? What if Giles finds out?
ANYA: He's too busy not leaving to pay  attention to me. Besides, I ended up getting it on E-Bay.
TARA: (disbelieving) You found the last known Urn of Osiris on E-Bay?
ANYA: Yeah. From this Desert Gnome in  Cairo. He drove a hard bargain, but  I finally got him to throw in a limited  edition Backstreet Boys lunch box for --
XANDER: You got your somber on, Will. The urn not up to spec?
WILLOW: It's the one.
XANDER: It's time? Like, time time? With the… timeliness?
ANYA: Are you sure?
WILLOW: I am.
TARA: Mercury's in retrograde, and we have -- do we have everything?
WILLOW: Just about.
XANDER: But why the sudden rushy-rush? Did the bot blow her cover at school?
TARA: No, she did great. She impressed all the teachers.
XANDER: And they still thought it was Buffy?
WILLOW: Tomorrow night. We'll meet here at--
XANDER: Whoah! Let's apply the brake and  check rear and side mirrors here!  This is deep stuff, Willow. We're  talking about raising the dead.
WILLOW: And it's time to stop talking.  Tomorrow night, we're bringing  Buffy back.
ANYA: Tomorrow.
XANDER: I don't know...
ANYA: Discovery Channel has monkeys. And our tape machine's sorta wonky--
WILLOW: Guys. I need you guys on board here.
XANDER: It just ... it feels wrong.
TARA: It is wrong.
WILLOW: Nobody's changing their minds. Period.
XANDER: Excuse me. Who made you the boss  of the group?
ANYA: You did.
TARA: You said 'Willow should be boss.'
ANYA: And then you said 'Let's vote' and it was unanimous.
TARA: You made her that little plaque that  said 'BOSS OF US,' you put on sparkles--
XANDER: Valid points all. But we -- I mean, we  were just talking then...
WILLOW: I can do this, Xander. I promise. But not without you.
ANYA: Should we maybe tell Giles? Now  that we're really ready? It's not  like he's going anywhere -- ever...
WILLOW: No. No one else can know. Not  Giles, not Spike, not Dawn. They  might not understand--
TARA: And if something does go wrong--
WILLOW: I'm telling you it won't.
XANDER: Scenario: We raise Buffy from the grave.  She tries to eat our brains. Do we, 'A':  congratulate ourselves on a job well done--
WILLOW: This isn't Zombies, Xander.
ANYA: Zombies don't eat brains anyway.  Unless instructed to by their Zombie masters. Lotta people get that wrong.
WILLOW: This isn't like Dawn trying to bring back  Mrs. Summers or anything we've dealt  with before . Buffy didn't die a natural  death. She was killed by mystical energy.
TARA: Which means we do have a shot.
WILLOW: It means more than that. It means we don't know where she really is.
XANDER: We saw her body, Will. We buried it.
WILLOW: (getting worked up) Her body, yeah, but her soul, her  essence -- that could be somewhere  else, trapped it some Hell dimension  like Angel was. Suffering some eternal  torment that we can't even imagine  just because she saved us and I am  not gonna let her... (near tears) ...I'm not gonna leave her there.
XANDER: What time do we meet?
WILLOW: What happened? Where's Dawn?
SPIKE: Dawn's fine. She's upstairs in bed.  But it seems the bot here got into a  scrape while she was on patrol.
BUFFYBOT: I think my feet are broken.
WILLOW: Looks more like a short in the navigational system. (to Spike) Can you get me the flashlight? It's in the kitchen.
SPIKE: She wanted to go out again and look  for you, but I figured there are enough  things in Sunnydale that go bump in  the night ...
WILLOW: Good thinking-
BUFFYBOT: But my homing device locates you  when I'm injured. I'm programmed to  go to you.
WILLOW: I know. Still, just this once it was  a good idea to stay put. Spike was right.
BUFFYBOT: I'm sorry I questioned you, Spike.  You know I admire your brain almost  as much as your washboard abs.
SPIKE: (to Willow) I told you to make her stop doing that.
WILLOW: I did. I mean, I thought I got all that stuff out of the program-
SPIKE: Well, you've got her opened up -  fix it.
WILLOW: Sure. I mean I've got a lot of work here, but I'll see what I can do.
BUFFYBOT: Did I say something wrong?
WILLOW: No. It's not your fault.
BUFFYBOT: I think Spike stopped liking me.
WILLOW: That's not true. He thinks you're swell.
BUFFYBOT: Then how come he never looks at me anymore? Even when he's talking to me?
WILLOW: He just gets cranky. Like vampires do. (then) Now just relax...
GILES: Splendid. But let's try it once more,  and this time remember your breathing.
BUFFYBOT: I don't require oxygen to live.
GILES: Of course. Strictly speaking, but-
ANYA: Maybe you'd better stick to the  standard drill. You don't want her  to blow another gasket.
GILES: I'm testing her responses after her injury.  I don't see how it can hurt to impart a  little Eastern philosophy...
ANYA: I just think the concept of "chi" is  a little tough for her to grasp. She's  not the descendant of a long line of  mystical warriors - she's the descendant  of a toaster oven.
GILES: I appreciate your input, Anya, but I think Buffybot has responded quite  nicely to our sessions.
ANYA: (forced pleasant) Well, you're the boss. Still.
BUFFYBOT: Would you like to test me again?
GILES: Maybe we should call it a day. Your responses look fine.
BUFFYBOT: A human?
GILES: Yes.
BUFFYBOT: But I like your teaching. Every slayer needs her watcher.
GILES: I'm not so sure about that.
BUFFYBOT: What do you mean?
GILES: Nothing. (then) I just can't help but wonder if she  would have been better off without  me. Buffy.
BUFFYBOT: I don't think that's true. You were very helpful to her.
GILES: Right. I was the perfect watcher.
BUFFYBOT: It wasn't your fault-
GILES: Of course not. It's how every  slayer-watcher relationship ends,  isn't it? She's gone. I did my job.
BUFFYBOT: (innocently) Then why are you still here?
VAMP: ... so I've got her cornered in this alley, see?
MAG: (disbelieving) You've got the slayer cornered.
VAMP: Yeah. I figured, it's my duty, right?  She's a menace to our society. So we  fight - and I'm like - BOOM, BOOM,  BOOM! I got her on the ropes-
MAG: You lying to me?
VAMP: I swear on all that's unholy! You  haven't even heard the best part. I cut her, right? And she's, I don't know,  some kind of machine. She's not human.
MAG: You're high.
VAMP: I'm telling you - it wasn't even the  slayer, man. It was like a trick. A robot.
RAZOR: What's with the blood rat?
MAG: (to vampire) Talk.
VAMP: (nervous) Okay. See, I was over in Sunnydale,  minding my own beeswax, when I see  the Slayer-
MAG: The part about the robot.
VAMP: We fought, right? And I was all over her - BOOM, BOOM-
MAG: He says the slayer's been replaced by some kind of machine-
VAMP: A robot, yeah! And I kicked her synthetic ass. You shoulda seen the sparks ...
RAZOR: You're telling me there's no Slayer in Sunnydale.
VAMP: That's what I'm saying. They've got  some kind of decoy standing in for  her. The town is wide open.
MAG: Nowhere like the Hellmouth for a  party. There's all kinds of bad in  that place.
VAMP: Yeah. With your muscle you could  own it in no time. And, look, I know  you guys don't usually let vampires  join the gang and I've got the whole- (makes quotes) "sunlight issue"- but I was thinking,  as thanks for the 411, you might let  me throw in with you-
RAZOR: I'll think it over.
WILLOW: Adonai, Helomi, Pine... Adonai,  Helomi, Pine... The gods do command  thee from thy majesty...
TARA: Hey. You're late.
WILLOW: Oh, I had to get that thing.
XANDER: Giles isn't around. You can dump the cryptic.
WILLOW: The last spell ingredient.
XANDER: Okay. Right. What is "Vino de Madre" anyway?
WILLOW: "Wine of the Mother." Kind of... black market stuff.
TARA: Black market? You didn't tell me that.  You shouldn't have gone alone. It could have been dangerous.
WILLOW: Sorry. I didn't ... I was careful.
ANYA: It must be something pretty intense.  The black market is all baby teeth  and spooky fluids.
WILLOW: All I know is - we have to have it to  do the spell. Which makes it good  stuff in my book.
XANDER: We weren't, but it felt too weird hanging  out on our own.
TARA: It's better that we're together.
WILLOW: You got butterflies, baby?
TARA: More like bats.
ANYA: Would you like to look at the money?  I find it calms me.
TARA: That's okay. Thanks.
WILLOW: Tell the bats it's going to be alright.  I promise. We couldn't be more prepared.
TARA: I know. I just wish it was time. I can't stand worrying about it anymore.
ANYA: Well, it's your lucky day then. I have something to distract you.
WILLOW: What?
XANDER: (reading) "I've gone. Not one for good-byes, I thought it best to slip out quietly.  Love to you all, Giles."
GILES: Well. I was trying to avoid a scene.
WILLOW: Like we'd make a scene.
GILES: Not you. Me.
ANYA: We brought you lovely parting gifts. See?
TARA: And a monster. Kind of a Sunnydale souvenir, we thought. Grrrr. Argggh.
XANDER: I wanted to buy you a can of Old English  800. 'Cause, you know, of England  and you... And 'cause it sounded funny  at the time but the guy living in the box  in front of the store wouldn't buy it for us.
DAWN: We got your presents at the gas station. We were kind of in a hurry. (gives him a card) And we made this in the car. That's why the letters are all shaky.
GILES: This is ... impossible, really.
WILLOW: We just wanted you to know we'll  be okay. We'll miss you - but we'll  be okay.
ANYA: And I'll take very good care of your money.
GILES: I have no doubt.
SYSTEM: Attention passengers, flight 3982,  leaving for Los Angeles and  continuing to London. Rows 20-30  are boarding from gate A6.
GILES: That's me.
WILLOW: Now? God, we just made it...
GILES: Just, yes.
SYSTEM: Attention passengers, final boarding  for flight 3982 for Los Angeles and  London at gate A6. Please come to  the gate with your boarding passes ready.
GILES: I'm a phone call away, if you need anything. You must promise me.
DAWN: I do. I promise.
GILES: Willow. I don't know where to start ...
WILLOW: (near tears) Maybe you shouldn't. I'm trying to be stiff-upper-lippy.
GILES: Right. Right ...
WILLOW: You'd better get going. Don't you have a life or something?
GILES: I suppose that's the question, isn't it?
WILLOW: There he goes.
XANDER: Good thing. My face hurts from faux smiling.
WILLOW: (distressed) It was right, though, wasn't it? Giving  him the no-tears send-off ... We don't  want him going off all worried about us.
ANYA: He'll still be all worried, just eight hours ahead.
WILLOW: What's he going to do over there  by himself? He never talks about  people in England. What if he's lonely?
TARA: He won't be lonely. He lived there before, remember?
DAWN: And I'm sure we'll talk to him  all the time. Right? It's not like he's...
TARA: We'll call him tomorrow. How about that? See how his flight was ...
XANDER: Can you believe the timing? He's leaving right when we're doing- (eyes Dawn) The thing. Tonight.
WILLOW: I know. I was hoping we'd figure it out before he left.
ANYA: Maybe we should have said something to him. What if it works?
WILLOW: He'll come back.
XANDER: It'll be dark soon.
WILLOW: Let's get Dawn home. I want to go  over everything one more time.  Nothing can go wrong tonight.
WILLOW: Does everybody have their candles?
ANYA: Mine won't stay lit. It keeps going out.
WILLOW: Well, make it stay. It has to-
TARA: (to Xander) What time is it?
XANDER: One minute to midnight. Less.
WILLOW: Come on, Anya. Do you have it?
ANYA: Oh God... (candle lights) Got it!
WILLOW: Start the circle. Now.
XANDER: Willow!
TARA: No. She told me... She'd be tested.  This is what's supposed to happen-
WILLOW: Osiris! Here lies the warrior of the people! Let her cross over!
XANDER: She needs help!
TARA: Xander. She's strong. She said not  to stop, no matter what. If anything  b-b-breaks the cycle now - it-s over-
ANYA: Oh God. What's that noise?
WILLOW: Osiris! Let her cross over!
TARA: Oh God... Oh, God...
DAWN: What's going on?
SPIKE: Stay away from the window.
DAWN: What is it? What's happening?
SPIKE: Just do as I say. (then) I'm going to check the rest of the house. Don't move.
BUFFYBOT: Put it back or-
RAZOR: Slayer. I've been hearing interesting things about you.
BUFFYBOT: (matter of fact) Yes. I am interesting. (then) Are these your friends?
RAZOR: They're my guys, yeah.
BUFFYBOT: Good. Tell them to get on their loud  bicycles and go back to wherever they  came from-
RAZOR: Or what? You'll electrocute us?
BUFFYBOT: I would, but you injured me. I have to report to Willow.
RAZOR: Get her!
WILLOW: Osiris! Release her!
BUFFYBOT: Willow - I need service!
WILLOW: No!!
TARA: Willow-
MAG: Look what I found!
TARA: (Latin) Dissolvo! (English translation) Release!
XANDER: Willow, are you okay?
WILLOW: Did it work?
XANDER: I - I'm sorry.
