(brightly) I think it's funny.
Ooh! Who's there?
(continuing the knock knock joke) If we want her to be exactly she'll  never be exactly I know the only really real Buffy is really Buffy  and she's gone who?
I'll get it-
I'll just say hello. He's my biological ancestor.
Is my phone manner not correct?
I do. I want you to stay as well. You're my sister.
What is this?
They're very nice. But I don't understand...
I don't know of a breed of humans this small. Who's going to live here?
School is where you learn.
I helped make lunch today.
Before school. Peanut butter and Jelly.  I don't eat, but Dawn takes one everyday-
(to victim) I'm going to kill him.
(still to victim) You can run away now.
Thank you...
I think my feet are broken.
But my homing device locates you  when I'm injured. I'm programmed to  go to you.
I'm sorry I questioned you, Spike.  You know I admire your brain almost  as much as your washboard abs.
Did I say something wrong?
I think Spike stopped liking me.
Then how come he never looks at me anymore? Even when he's talking to me?
I don't require oxygen to live.
Would you like to test me again?
A human?
But I like your teaching. Every slayer needs her watcher.
What do you mean?
I don't think that's true. You were very helpful to her.
It wasn't your fault-
(innocently) Then why are you still here?
Put it back or-
(matter of fact) Yes. I am interesting. (then) Are these your friends?
Good. Tell them to get on their loud  bicycles and go back to wherever they  came from-
I would, but you injured me. I have to report to Willow.
Willow - I need service!
