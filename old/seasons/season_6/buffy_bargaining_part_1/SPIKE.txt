Come on! I'm never gonna get anything killed with you lot holding me back!

(to Tara) It was that powder you blew at him made him rabbit out.
("you're an idiot") Yeah. That must be it.
(also amused) We could all be--

What's with the Dadaism, Red?
She'll never be exactly.
Makes sense.
Yeah. She responded to Buffybot  because a robot is predictable, boring...  A perfect teacher's pet.

Because Buffy would want you to.
So what do you fancy, bit? Game a rummy?
I'm not. And yeah I do.
I'm not going to leave you here by yourself. So forget it.
No. I'm not leaving you to get hurt. Not again. (then) Now deal.

She wanted to go out again and look  for you, but I figured there are enough  things in Sunnydale that go bump in  the night ...

Well, you've got her opened up -  fix it.
Stay away from the window.
Just do as I say. (then) I'm going to check the rest of the house. Don't move.
