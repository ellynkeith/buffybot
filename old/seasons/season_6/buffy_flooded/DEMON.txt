We had a deal. You got what you wanted. Now give me what I want. The head of the Slayer.
You hired me to create carnage and chaos for you. You told me you were powerful men, commanding machines, magicks and the demon realms below.
Which of you is leader?
I will kill your leader.
I will kill you all.
You cannot pay me with paper, tiny king. For pitting me against the Slayer, I must kill you.
Give me what?
(interested) You can do this?
ENOUGH!!!
(suspicious) For what?
Make sure it involves pain.
You're not the Slayer. But you'll do for a start.
Ahhh!
You have cost me, Slayer.
I have been looking forward to this, Slayer.
