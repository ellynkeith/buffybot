Okay.
We are.
Yes! Truly, Lord Jonathan is wisest of us all.
Whoa, big guy, let's back things up a parsec. Now, if you kill us? Everybody loses. But - let us live, we give you ...
Between the three of us, we can do pretty much anything.
Or? Just throwing it out there- robot girlfriend. Huh? For those long, lonely nights after a hard day's slaughter?
Shut up, Andrew! You're just mad I wouldn't build you Christina Ricci!
Or else what? You'll train another pack of devil-dogs to ruin my prom? <i>Graduated</i>.
That was cool.
One dead Slayer, coming up. Um, could you just give us a minute?
We just wanna really nail down the optimum method for us to wipe out that Slayer for you.
Shut up, Whine-athan.
It's her or us. We have to do it.
I'm talking about staying alive, and this is my Mom's house so I think what I say goes.
<i>Dur</i>! Last I checked, the authorities frown on bank robbery too, genius.
So ... you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?
Of course I remember. It was last month.
Vote. JONATHAN Okay. Who's for not killing Buffy?
Wait here. I got an idea.
(shrugs) The force can sometimes have great power on the weak-minded.
We got the money. We got the lair. And our one loose end has been taken care of by the Slayer.
Whoa, whoa, don't get all crazy on us, Andrew.
We could hypnotize her.
Earn it?
