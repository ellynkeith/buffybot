So, we meet at last, Mister Drippy.
No.
Yes.
Dawn - I'm on it, okay?
You were right. The plumber will make everything good.
(a little spaced) But breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It's unbelievably important. Dawn, you should eat breakfast three times a day.
Thank you. So? We'll pay him, what's the big deal.
Lying flat on my back?
So, okay, you're telling me I'm broke?
But, I haven't spent any money. I was all dead and frugal.
How'd I do that?
Easy. We burn the house to the ground, collect the insurance. Plus, fire? Pretty.
(to Dawn) I'll take care of this. I promise. I just don't know how yet.
For what?
Well, that's an idea... you would have. Any other suggestions?
This is my first big loan. (then) Collateral? No problem. (then) No problem. (then) Love the tie. (then) I'm a problem <i>solver</i>. (then) Let's.crunch those numbers! (re: herself) Stupid skirt.
Buffy Summers. Loan Applier-for.
Um, so... about my getting a loan... ?
I know. And I figured you could just cut through that tangle with scissors. (gestures snipping) Where the loan is the scissors.
Are you saying you won't give me a loan?
(resigned) No job. I wish.
Hey!
These? Never helpful.
You're asking the wrong gal.
You noticed.
Oh, well, that's good then. (beat) It's gone now.
And you know I really doubt it.
Will, what the hell are you doing?
Yes. True. Why?
What do you mean?
(to Dawn) You do research now? You want a cappuccino, maybe a pack of cigarettes to go with that?
Maybe they turned down his loan application. (beat) That's him. Big, bad ... this thing was strong, guys. No weapons I could see but ...
Huh? Oh. Sorry.
I take some getting used to. <u>I'm</u> still getting used to me.
A miracle?
I can start. How was England? (beat) How was life?
Tons of fun.
And now you're back.
Wow. Giles, are you miserable about it, or just really British?
I'm guessing the word is "inconvenient."
Me? Nah. Fine. (then) I mean, yeah, sleeping's hard, but just because of that whole waking up in a box thing. So maybe it's waking up that's the problem. But only for a second. I sleep okay. Great even, except, you know ... for the dreams ...
Well, actually, it wasn't me. Willow brought me back. I just lay there.
I know what you meant. Just a little post post-mortem comedy... (then) Better start prepping. The slayage.
Seems that way.
But they're all I got.
They were mine when I was little. I couldn't find the guest sheets. Mom always did this stuff.
Pff. I blame the sofa. We need a real pull-out bed. The kind with no payments 'til two-thousand-and-infinity.
Just, money stuff. Turns out Mom left me some and while I was dead? Got squandered on luxuries like food and clothing.
Anya says bad. I'm kinda taking her word for it. Actually, I'm kinda trying to not think about it.
Yeah, I'll just put it out of my mind for awhile, take a break, get some perspective ... then wake up at four a.m. terrified.
In the meantime, I'm scaring people.
Good. I've always hoped to freak out the people who love me. And not just in the short-term, but you know - as a lifestyle.
I guess, but I don't know, Giles, I mean ... stuff like spoons are still weird to me. Then you add complex financial issues on top of that, and - Buffy go bye-bye.
(smiles) Was that meant to be soothing?
I'm glad you're back.
Hello, Spike.
Just enough to make me feel crappy.
I guess. Everyone's all ... they all care. They all care so much, it makes it all harder.
I don't know. I just feel like, like I'm spending all my time trying to be okay, so no one'll worry. It's exhausting, and then I get all ... (can't find the words)
Why are you always around when I'm miserable?
Me neither.
So, you know anything about finances?
You're paying for that door, buddy!
I cost you? That's a designer lamp, ya mook!
Gahh!
Less breakables.
Open the door! The basement!
No!
This is going to take forever, isn't it?
I've trashed this house so many times. How did Mom pay for all this?
No. I will definitely ... probably not be doing that.
Aw. Poor lumpy Giles.
Dunno. And now he's way too dead to answer that question. Wish we knew who hired him.
Giles. I don't think I can do this.
You sure?
Who'd be calling? Everyone I know lives here. (as she goes) Be right back. We'll get into this. I want to kick financial obligation's ass.
Angel.
He knows I'm ... He needs to see me. And I have to see him.
(shakes her head) Not L.A. And not here. We'll meet in the middle. There's a place...
I gotta go now.
