Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Carl Savitsky. Loan Officer.
Okay. I don't think I'll need this ... or these... old report cards, definitely not...
Yes. Well, what we've got here is, financially, a bit of a tangle.
Ms. Summers, the only collateral you have is your house, which was never fully leveraged, and has been losing equity over the last several years. For some reason, Sunnydale property values have never been competitive, and re-financing's out of the question...
Well the problem is, you have no income. No job...
