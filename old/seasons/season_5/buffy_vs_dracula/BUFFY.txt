Touchdown! Yes! Go team <u>Me</u>!
I do?
It was an accidental… slew. (then/ to Xander) Where are the burgers?
You're not drifty. You have school.
Willow! Check you out! Witch-fu!
No way. This is so wrong.
Take this away. Whatever it is.
That's it. I'll face monsters, but I'm done helping you clean.
Actually I'm starting to miss the whole military fold-your-clothes- with-a-ruler experience.
You sure that's yours? Looks kinda…snug.
Ooh. I'd love to.
But I promised my mom I'd hang at the homestead tonight. She's bummed that I'm going back to the dorm - feeling all empty nesty.
I'd better scram. I'm late.
Thanks, mom. Everything was mega yum.
I would - but I have to get out and patrol.
Vamps don't care what time it is, mom. Dark equals dinner bell.
(kindly) You should get a pet. A loud one.
Understood. How about a rat? Amy makes a lot of noise on that little wheely thing.
Then a puppy. One of those kinds with the smooshy face.
Good… This was great though
We'll do it again when school starts. Make a regular date night.
Sorry. Duty calls. It's a total drag.
That was no hunt. That was just another day on the job. Care to step up for some overtime?
(sardonically) Do you understand what a slayer is?
Who are you?
<u>Get out</u>!
So - let me get this straight. You're Dracula. The guy. The count.
This isn't just a fanboy thing, is it? 'Cause I've fought more than a couple of pimply, overweight vamps who called themselves "Lestat."
You've heard of me?
Naw!… Really?
I prefer the term "Slayer." "Killer" just sounds so…
Like I paint clowns or something. I'm the good guy, remember?
What do you mean, history? I hail from a long line of white hats, period.
No, you know what I feel? Bored.
(frustrated) Okay. That's cheating.
(urgently) Get out of here. <u>Now</u>.
Behind you!
Xander, I'm pretty certain that's <u>Dracula</u>.
Bat! Eww! Bat!!
I told you he'd heard of me, right? Can you believe that? Count Famous heard of me?
Sorry. Am I repeato girl? I guess I'm a little blown away.
I guess. But the way he said it, he made it sound so-
Kinda. He of the dark, penetrating eyes and lilty accent…
Actually, I was more thinking - "<u>BAT!!</u>"
Right… I guess we should take things slow with Dracula. He said we'd meet again, but I'd like to avoid it until we do some serious homework-
So we hold off. No killing until we know exactly what we're dealing with.
We may not be as fast - but we'll find him. Let's say we reconvene here in the morning?
Big sleep. My count encounter wiped me out.
You sure? I bet if you just lay down with me-
(smiles) Good point. So I'll see you here?
Ummm. Heaven.
See? A little sugar and I'm all  yours. Dracula Shmakula.
Bet you say that before you bite all the girls.
Kindred? Hardly, I --
Ha. You really think you can just waft in here with your hypno eyes and you music video wind and - and…
He was-
No…
Hum? (then/to Giles) Right - sorry. Swanky places first. What else did you guys get?
Huuuuh.
Nope. Uh uh.
(hastily) That's interesting. I'll go look for him.
It's cool. I'm on top of it.
Thanks, but I've got it under control. Really.
What? I will not.
(blustering) Please. I am not under the thrall of the Dark Prince!
Let me go. This is ridiculous-
Oh, God…
I'm not sure why I tried to hide it. I guess I was embarrassed that I let him do this to me… And, I don't know, I couldn't fight this voice telling me to cover it.
It does seem like he's got some kind of control over me, even though a big part of me is resisting…
Riley -
(firmly) Listen to me. I'm not transfer-y I swear. I'm your girl, and I'm going to stay that way.
(nods) I can't go home. He already got inside once.
Take me to him.
Why? 'Cause I'm under your thrall?
Well, guess again, pal.
(instantly obeys) Okay.
Right. That was - that was not you. I did that because I wanted to, and - and… (uh oh) Maybe I should rethink that thrall thing.
Stay away from me…
No… last night was… That's not gonna happen again.
I'm… any minute now…
'Cause you're famous?
(tries to look away) My friends are -
(breathless denial) I don't… need to know…
I won't… let you…
What are you…
No… if I taste that -
I'm not hungry.
Wow.
That was really gross.
Looks like…
You know, I think the thrall has really gone out of our relationship. But I wanna thank you for opening my eyes a little.
My true nature. Wanna taste?
Who says I'm running? Come on Drac. We did your little dance. Let's see if you're any good at mine.
A guy like you should think about going electric. Seriously.
No you don't -
(quite intensely) How do you like my darkness now?
I'm good. Chock full of free will.
Eurotrashed.
He's gone.
Check. No more butt monkey.
You think I don't watch your movies? You always come back.
You rang?
You put out cookies. How come I rate little cookie treatment?
Cookie important? Yeah, I guess I have something too.
That's okay -
You know, you haven't been my watcher for awhile. I haven't been training, I haven't needed to come to you for help -
And then this whole thing with Dracula, it's made me face up to some stuff.. I've changed so much since I first became the slayer. I'm still changing. Ever since we did that spell that called on the first slayer… I've been going out a lot. Every night…
<u>Hunting</u>. That's what Dracula called it, and he was right. He understood my power, better than I do. He saw darkness in it. (then/heartfelt) I need to know more. About where I come from. About the other slayers. Maybe if I learn to control this thing - maybe I could even be better, stronger… But I'm scared. It's gonna be hard, and I can't do it… without you. (then) I need your help. I need you to be my watcher again.
So - I just talked all over you. You had something to say too.
I'm outta here. Riley and I are going to the movies.
What are you doing in here?
