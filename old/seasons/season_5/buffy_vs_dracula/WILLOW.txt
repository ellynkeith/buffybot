I think we've just put our finger on why we're the sidekicks.
Game over?
What's the deal, Xand? I thought you were a cow griller by trade.
(offers/ to Riley) I do. Really. I was gonna structure my major around computer science - but now I don't know… what if drama class is awesome? Do I cast off the safe and dependable for the exhilarating unknown?
Ohhh, God… See that's… The Goddess Thespia - she was a total drama queen and… (running out of steam) The seventh house, that's like when… Ahhhh… Whooo…
It <u>was</u> funny. Super funny and clever and… (giving up) Fire ready yet?
(Latin) Ignis incede. (translation) Fire arise.
(falsely humble) It's no big. You just have to balance the elements, so when you affect one you don't end up causing-
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
There you go. All set.
Just call me the computer whisperer. (then) Well - let's get scanning. I want to see this puppy go.
(expression falling) Start? Where is finish?
But - now? Doesn't winter seem more like archiving season? Nothing like a nice warm cup of cocoa and some archivin', I always say. Or, I plan to say that…
No. it's fine. It's just, you've been Mr. Project all summer. I mean, labeling the amulets, indexing your diaries… (not unkindly) I draw the line at making giant rubber band balls. That's when you'll just have to get a life.
Might go better if you left the house.
Uh oh.
(anxious) Oh God… I guess. Now that I know there's something to know - I can't <u>not</u> know just because I'm afraid someone will know I know, you know?
Yeah…
You're - what? But you can't. You're Buffy's watcher. I mean, in a fired way.
(desperate) But what about the rest of us? We still need to be watched. Personally, I can't get through a day without a little hairy eyeball.
When are you going to tell Buffy?
It better be soon. A girl can only contain "I have a secret face" for so long.
(re: drink) There's something in these. If I don't' get my daily fix I start to get itchy.
But it makes me so cute and mood-swingy!
Xand? What if somebody had a secret, and that somebody promised somebody else that she wouldn't tell anyone, and-
It's not about me and Tara.
Sorry. This is of the non-naughty variety. And I'm not telling.
Sure. Anyway, if I did tell you - which I'm not going to…
Yeah, you look like you saw a --
(small) Hi.
And then he lunges at us - Like WOOSH, and-
Sexy. I bet he made it sound sexy.
(oops) What? Oh, no. he was - yuck.
No big whoop? What about the thing where he turned into a bat? That was awesome.
Me too. I kept thinking - gosh, I wish Giles were here. He'd know what to do. (to Buffy and Xander) Didn't you guys? Think that?
Great point! It's so <u>Giles</u> to think of something like that. Which we would have never.
Well, I think we got some Dracula factoids…
A lot of it we already knew… Turn offs: wood, fire, crosses, garlic. Turn ons: nice duds, minions and long slow bites that last for days…
Actually, my research backs Riley up. Drac isn't the lay low type.
(quickly) Only because you gave me super pointers. I never would have-
Okay. Dracula's modus operandi is different from other vampires. He'll kill just to feed, but he'd rather have a connection with his victims. And he has all kinds of mental powers to draw them in. He can read and control minds, appear in dreams.
It makes sense. That stare… he kind of looked right through you… Didn't you feel it Buffy?
No, he's right Buffy. It's safer.
(not buying it) Two deep, puncture-y scratches.
Got it. (then) How did he get inside, anyway?
A good Sunnydale rules of thumb? Avoid white-skinned men in capes.
