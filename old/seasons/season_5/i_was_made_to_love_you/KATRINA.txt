Hi. Did you get me a drink?
See who? Warren, what's up?
But we just got here. If you don't want to be here, why didn't we just stay in Dutton? Or we could've gone to my sister's.
Why the rush? It's real early. Are we even going to say good-bye to your mom?
Warren, is there something going on you don't want me to see?
Who's this?
Her who? Something's going on here -- strange girls--
And I'm not important? Warren, tell her to go away.
You're keeping secrets from me... other girls, who knows what else!
Okay. That's it. Forget it, Warren. I'm gone.
Okay, this is getting insane. How many of you are there?
April. Fine. Listen up, April. Warren is my boyfriend. Mine. And you others probably ought to figure that-- Ow!
Let go! That hurts!
What-- stop!
I can't... I can't breathe...  let go...
What's going on?
What... What is... that's a robot!
Is this... this is your ex- girlfriend? You <u>built</u> her?!
No! Get the hell away from me!
