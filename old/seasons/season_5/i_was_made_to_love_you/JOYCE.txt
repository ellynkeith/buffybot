You're messing with me.
So is anyone going to talk about the dress?
You sure? It's not too, you know, mom-ish?
(sarcastic) I'm so glad you two agreed to help. (then) Oh God, what time is it?
No, he works at a publishing house. A nice, normal guy, okay?
I met him my first day back at the gallery when I was still kinda shaky, you know, starting over. He asked a question about these antique cameos and I was so lost 'cause Carol did the ordering while I was sick. But it turned out he didn't know anything about them either, so we had a lot to talk about.
Dinner and then a movie. Or maybe it was a movie and then dinner. Which might be better because then we can talk about the movie. Or maybe a movie isn't a good idea at all, because you can't talk during and then what's the point of any of it. Also, what kind of a restaurant? One with candles and romantic music, or is that pushing it?
Unfortunately, we're not dating in a movie from the thirties. Buffy, what do you think? Should I try to make things romantic or sort of let him set the pace?
Honey, you've just had some bad luck.
Oh God-- Brian. What time is it now?
You're sure this dress is okay?
So who wants to hear everything?
Bye, Rupert!
Gosh, I'd forgotten how much fun dating can be!
Yes, I suppose by your standards it would seem pretty-- Oh dear.
I left my bra in his car.
I'm joking!
I left it in the restaurant.
(called after) On the dessert cart!
I'm just torturing your sister.
Good. Really good.
You know? I hope so. I think he had a good time. And what did you do tonight?
