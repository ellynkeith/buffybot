BUFFY: Spike! Spike wants me. how obscene is that?
GILES: It is very strange. I can't imagine what he's thinking. (realizing) Not that you're not attrac--
BUFFY: I feel gross, you know? Like, dirty.
GILES: That's ridiculous. You're not responsible for what Spike thinks or feels.
BUFFY: Aren't I? Responsible? I mean, it had to be something about me that did it, right? Something that made Spike say... "Woof, that's the one for me."
GILES: Buffy, I think you might need to calm down a little...
BUFFY: Oh! Puffy Xander! I got carried away. You okay?
XANDER: I'm alive. I can tell 'cause of the pain.
BUFFY: Do you want to sit down?
XANDER: I'm not that bendy. I can lean.
GILES: I'll get some ice.
BUFFY: Comfy?
XANDER: Oh yeah. This leaning, this is the stuff.
BUFFY: See, that's my secret to attracting me. It's simple. I slap 'em around a bit, torture 'em, make their lives hell...
XANDER: Buffy--
BUFFY: ...Sure, the nice guys'll run away, but every now and then you'll find a prince like Spike who gets off on it--
XANDER: Buffy. Stand me up.
XANDER: The problem is not you. Don't do this to yourself. Please.
BUFFY: But... I just... I just want to know that there's gonna be another one, another good one. One that I won't chase away.
XANDER: There will be. I promise. He's out there. He could come along any minute.
BUFFY: Great. And the minute after that I can terrify him with my alarming strength and remarkable self- involvement.
XANDER: What? I don't think you're like that.
BUFFY: Maybe I can change. You know, work harder, spend less time Slaying, laugh at his jokes-- Men like that, don't they? The joke-laughing-at?
XANDER: Or maybe you could just be Buffy and he'll see your amazing heart and fall in love with you.
BUFFY: That's... that's really...
XANDER: <u>This</u> is the day you pick to hug me.
XANDER: Buffy...
BUFFY: Mmm?
XANDER: You ever think, maybe the reason you haven't found a great relationship on the Hellmouth is because <u>it's a Hellmouth</u>? Seems to me this is a pretty terrible place to try to build anything.
APRIL: Thank you for picking me up! I'm very grateful for the ride!
DRIVER: Hey, you sure you wanna get out here? This place is kinda-- I mean, what are you lookin' for in Sunnydale?
APRIL: True love.
BUFFY: I might like it more than the others. Spin again.
DAWN: I'm not sure. Once more.
BUFFY: Now the other way.
JOYCE: You're messing with me.
BUFFY: Just wanted to see how many time you'd do it.
DAWN: (to Buffy) Was that five or four-and-a-half?
JOYCE: So is anyone going to talk about the dress?
DAWN: I like it.
JOYCE: You sure? It's not too, you know, mom-ish?
DAWN: Oh. That was why I liked it.
BUFFY: You're both crazy! It's not mom-ish at all! It's sexy! It screams randy-sex- kitten-buy-me-one-drink-and-I'll... Wait... that's not good either.
JOYCE: (sarcastic) I'm so glad you two agreed to help. (then) Oh God, what time is it?
BUFFY: (checks her watch) Four-twenty-three. You have lots of time 'til seven. Vast acres of time in which you could plant crops so tell us all about this Brian and guy and what his intentions are.
DAWN: Maybe he's a gigolo. Was his shirt all shiny?
JOYCE: No, he works at a publishing house. A nice, normal guy, okay?
BUFFY: I've heard of those.
JOYCE: I met him my first day back at the gallery when I was still kinda shaky, you know, starting over. He asked a question about these antique cameos and I was so lost 'cause Carol did the ordering while I was sick. But it turned out he didn't know anything about them either, so we had a lot to talk about.
DAWN: So, what's the plan for tonight?
JOYCE: Dinner and then a movie. Or maybe it was a movie and then dinner. Which might be better because then we can talk about the movie. Or maybe a movie isn't a good idea at all, because you can't talk during and then what's the point of any of it. Also, what kind of a restaurant? One with candles and romantic music, or is that pushing it?
DAWN: I think a date should be in a real fancy restaurant, then champagne at a night club with a floor show, then ballroom dancing.
JOYCE: Unfortunately, we're not dating in a movie from the thirties. Buffy, what do you think? Should I try to make things romantic or sort of let him set the pace?
BUFFY: Oh no, Love-Doctor Buffy is not in. I'm not qualified to give dating advice. I've had exactly two boyfriends and they both left. Really left. Left town left.
JOYCE: Honey, you've just had some bad luck.
DAWN: (to Buffy) You're going to that Spring Break party tonight, right? Maybe you'll meet someone there.
BUFFY: Right. Or maybe Brian has a son and Mom and me can go on some unspeakably awkward double dates.
JOYCE: Oh God-- Brian. What time is it now?
BUFFY: Four twenty-four.
JOYCE: You're sure this dress is okay?
DAWN: Spin again. Real fast this time.
TARA: Willow's good at all that computer stuff, but me, not so much. You really understand all that?
ANYA: Oh, at first it was confusing. Just the idea of computers was like -- whoa -- I'm eleven hundred years old here -- I had trouble adjusting to the idea of Lutherans.
TARA: I go on-line sometimes, but everyone has really bad spelling. It's depressing.
ANYA: Oh, but you have to try on-line trading. It's great. The secret is avoiding the tech companies everyone was jumping on, and going with the smaller firms that supply them with the basic components...
TARA: Uh-huh.
ANYA: Anyway, I took my money, from working for Giles, and I tripled it.
TARA: Tripled? Like first money, then money money money?
ANYA: Yes. I'm thinking about buying something very expensive. Maybe an antelope.
APRIL: Hi!
ANYA: Hi?
APRIL: I'm looking for Warren. Do you know where Warren is? And if you do, could you tell me?
TARA: Um... I don't think we know a Warren.
APRIL: All righty! No harm in asking! Thanks!
APRIL: Hi! Do you know Warren? I need to find him.
TARA: You can do this stuff with a regular computer?
ANYA: I'll show you! Also, you can see the web site I designed for the magic shop. <u>Huge</u> photo of me...
XANDER: How you doin'? Having o' the fun?
BUFFY: You know? I really am. Dancing with you is way better than trying to hook up with some good-looking guy.
XANDER: I think I liked it more when you were kicking me in the my puffy groin.
ANYA: I let them do that. Dance together. That was me.
TARA: Very nice of you.
WILLOW: A good deed.
ANYA: Yes. I'm expecting a big karmic reward any second now.
BEN: Buffy!
BUFFY: Ben, I didn't know you were here! And again with the non-medical clothing!
BEN: Actually, these are orthopedic pants. Oh man, that sounded so funny in my head.
BUFFY: It is funny! Very, very funny in my head too.
BEN: Having a good time?
BUFFY: Yeah. I was dancing earlier and my friends are here-- (catching herself) But this isn't all about me. Are you enjoying yourself?
BEN: I am now.
BUFFY: Would, um, would you like to dance or something?
BEN: I'm not really... good... rhythm... Sure. I'd love to. (indicates plate) I'll just go dump this... be right back.
ANYA: (re: Chex Mix) Look at these tiny grain patties -- they're woven! That's craftsmanship.
XANDER: They aren't hand-woven, you know.
ANYA: (mouth full) Then how?
XANDER: Well, it's, um, a machine, and it... it sort of... it presses...
XANDER: (distracted by April) ...there may be a mold of some sort... who's that?
ANYA: Oh, that girl. Tara and I met her. She speaks with a strange evenness and selects her words a shade too precisely.
XANDER: Some of us like that kind of thing in a girl.
APRIL: Warren?
KATRINA: Hi. Did you get me a drink?
WARREN: We've gotta go. She's gonna see me.
KATRINA: See who? Warren, what's up?
WARREN: It doesn't matter. Come on.
WILLOW: Hi. I thought you were getting crunchies.
ANYA: Xander got hypnotized by the strange girl. I am remaining calm, however.
XANDER: Huh? No. I'm right with you. Don't know what you're talking about. (nervous) Here she comes.
APRIL: I heard that Warren was here. Is Warren here?
XANDER: Um... Warren who?
APRIL: He's Warren and he's looking for me. He lost me.
APRIL: Is Warren here?
TARA: It's that girl again. (to Anya) She's still looking for "Warren"? Weird. It's been, like, all day.
WILLOW: There's something strange about her. She talks funny.
ANYA: Some men find that appealing.
TARA: I just hope she finds him.
XANDER: Somehow I don't think a girl who looks like that is gonna be lonely for too long.
WILLOW: Yeah. I mean, maybe this Warren guy is gone, but maybe there's some guy she's neglected that'll pop up right when she doesn't even know she needs him.
SPIKE: Small world. Oh dear, if looks could stake. Are you having fun, pet? Trolling for your next ex? Gotta say...
SPIKE: You could do better.
BUFFY: I told you--
SPIKE: You think I was gonna leave town? Free country. Free party. You want me to leave you can put your hands on my hot tight little body and make me.
BUFFY: (clenched) Get away from me.
BEN: Was that guy bothering you? Should I, um, offer to get inappropriately violent or something?
BUFFY: That's okay.
BEN: Good, 'cause, honestly... I don't wanna.
BUFFY: So, ready to dance?
BEN: Um... first...?
BUFFY: What's that?
BEN: Oh, yeah... my phone number. I was gonna try to work it subtly into the conversation, but... didn't pan out. And I figured I should try to give it to you <u>before</u> you see me dance.
BEN: You know, in case you want to get coffee...
BUFFY: Oh! That's... thank you! But I should tell you, I've got this kind of bad history. Where we have coffee and, well, it ends up with you leaving town, and you just got here and everything--
BEN: Hmm. Apparently we'd be risking a tragic chain reaction, but I just really like... coffee. I think coffee might be worth it. I'd like to get to know coffee better.
BUFFY: Then I'll call you.
SPIKE: (loudly) And who are you, darlin'?
APRIL: I'm April. I'm looking for my fella.
SPIKE: Maybe you just found him.
APRIL: Really? Where?
APRIL: Oh!
SPIKE: Hey! Hey! <u>Hey</u>!
APRIL: That would be wrong! You are not my boyfriend!
SPIKE: Bloody hell, you threw me through a window! What's that about?
APRIL: You cannot make those suggestions to me. I have a boyfriend. Warren is my boyfriend.
SPIKE: Know what? My bleedin' sympathies to Warren.
APRIL: No one but Warren can touch me!
BUFFY: (cautiously) Hi... Listen... maybe you and I should talk. Because, throwing Spike through a window, that's... well, that's good. But in general--
APRIL: Do you know my boyfriend?
BUFFY: Okay, I think you need to take a second to stop looking for your boyfriend--
APRIL: I have to find him. If I hurt you just now I am sorry and I hope your boyfriend will take good care of you.
BUFFY: Ow. I don't know about you guys, but I've had it with super-strong little women who aren't me.
TARA: At least she didn't do too much damage.
XANDER: Are you kidding? Double-glazed glass is not cheap. Also, the jamb has to be completely rebuilt-- Oh dear god, I'm the grown-up who sees the world through my job. I'm my Uncle Dave the plumber and I must be shunned.
WILLOW: Okay.
BUFFY: So, what the deal with the girl? I mean, what is she? 'Cuz this may sound nuts, but I had this real strong impression she was a...
TARA: Robot.
ANYA: She's a robot.
ANYA: She's a robot.
XANDER: Oh yeah, robot.
WILLOW: Robot.
BUFFY: I was gonna say robot. Okay, so what does she want?
TARA: Warren. Whoever that is.
XANDER: Gotta be the guy that built her.
WILLOW: Kind of an unusual name. There's hardly any except Warren Beatty and, you know, President Harding. (beat) It's probably not either of them.
XANDER: Sounds like a nerd to me.
ANYA: Hey, President Harding was quite the package when he was young. He had these amazing gray eyes--
BUFFY: Willow, can you track this guy down with just a first name?
WILLOW: Sure, given enough time. I can get a list of Sunnydale students named Warren tonight, but then we'd need to call 'em, or go to their dorms... we probably can't really start narrowing it down 'til tomorrow.
ANYA: She could do some damage then.
XANDER: To who? Spike? See me vigorously not caring. Also, she was looking for this Warren, but it didn't sound like she wanted to hurt him. She said he's her boyfriend.
WILLOW: I agree. I'm not sure this is a code red, guys. Is there a code pink? We need more codes.
BUFFY: Fine. We find Warren tomorrow. Tonight I better go rescue Giles. He's watching Dawn while Mom's on her date, and I get the feeling there's only so much he can take.
TARA: Oh, Giles and Dawny? I bet they ended up having a blast.
GILES: We're simply going to have to change the system. A fourteen- year-old is too old to be baby-sat for. It's not fair to her.
BUFFY: What did she make you do?
GILES: Well, we listened to some aggressively cheerful music sung by people chosen for their ability to dance, then we ate cookie dough and talked about boys.
BUFFY: I'm so sorry, but if it makes you feel any better, my fun-time-Buffy party night involved watching a robot throw Spike through a window, so if you want to trade... no wait, I wouldn't give up that memory for anything.
GILES: A robot? That's interesting.
BUFFY: We're going to work on it in the morning. Or, if you wanted to hang out a little longer, you and I could--
JOYCE: So who wants to hear everything?
BUFFY: ...listen to Mom talk about boys.
GILES: Yes, right! Must go! See you tomorrow! Good-bye, Joyce.
JOYCE: Bye, Rupert!
JOYCE: Gosh, I'd forgotten how much fun dating can be!
BUFFY: I don't know, I was standing right there. I didn't see Prince Charming. I didn't see a good- night kiss. It all looked pretty tame to me.
JOYCE: Yes, I suppose by your standards it would seem pretty-- Oh dear.
BUFFY: What?
JOYCE: I left my bra in his car.
BUFFY: Mother!
JOYCE: I'm joking!
BUFFY: Good God! That's horrible! Don't do that!
JOYCE: I left it in the restaurant.
BUFFY: No more! No more!
JOYCE: (called after) On the dessert cart!
DAWN: What the heck is going on out here?
JOYCE: I'm just torturing your sister.
DAWN: I'm for it. How was the date?
JOYCE: Good. Really good.
DAWN: You gonna see him again?
JOYCE: You know? I hope so. I think he had a good time. And what did you do tonight?
DAWN: Irritated Giles. I'm beginning to get why Buffy likes it so much.
RESIDENT: (out of it) Yes? What?
APRIL: Hi! Does Warren live here?
RESIDENT: What the hell...? What are you doing? It's three-thirty!
APRIL: Yes, it is! Does Warren live here?
APRIL: (to the door) Okay then! Bye!
GILES: And you're certain she was a robot?
BUFFY: Absolutely.
TARA: She practically had "Genuine Molded Plastic" stamped on her ass. (off their looks) Just tryin' a little spicy-talk.
ANYA: She was looking for someone named Warren.
BUFFY: Willow already checked the Sunnydale enrollment.
WILLOW: And got nothin'. I found one Warren but he moved out of the country a year ago... I'm trying nearby schools...
XANDER: Whoever he is, he knows his stuff. That girl was... well... that was a nice looking girl.
ANYA: (to Buffy) It's okay for him to say that because I know that he really loves me only.
GILES: Perhaps there's something the rest of us should be doing...
XANDER: What can we do?
TARA: Do you have any books on robots?
GILES: Oh, yes -- dozens. There's a lot of research to be done in order to-- no, I'm lying. Haven't got squat -- I just like watching Xander squirm.
XANDER: Funny. Charming and funny.
BUFFY: Hey, the no-research angle likes me just fine. But I'm still gonna have to --
WILLOW: Hey! I think I found him! Warren Mears. He was at Sunnydale High with us for a semester, then he went to the Tech College over in Dutton. I've got a local address where his folks still live.
TARA: He's probably home for Spring Break.
BUFFY: I'll go talk to him.
GILES: Wait. We don't know what you're walking into. I'd like to have a notion of what purpose the robot serves. What was he setting out to accomplish?
TARA: Um... Don't you think she's just...
WILLOW: Yeah... sort of just a...
XANDER: She's a sex bot. I mean, what guy doesn't dream about that? Beautiful girl with no other thought but to please you, willing to do anything...
XANDER: Too many girls. I miss Oz. He'd get it. He wouldn't say anything, but he'd get it.
ANYA: Why would anyone do that if they could have a real live person?
WILLOW: Maybe he couldn't. Find a real person.
BUFFY: Oh, come on! The guy's a big wedge of sleaze! Don't make excuses for him.
WILLOW: I'm not. I'm just saying... people get lonely. And having someone around, even someone you made up, well, maybe it's a little easier.
TARA: But it's so weird. I mean, everyone wants a nice, normal person to, you know, share with. If this guy, if he couldn't find that... I guess it's kind of sad.
GLORY: Arrrrrwwwwggg!
BEN: (a little ragged) Hello?...
BUFFY: Hi. It's Buffy. This a bad time? It's kinda early.
BEN: No. I just... I just got in is all. Night shift at the hospital. I'm glad you called.
BUFFY: Well, I found your phone number in my pocket and I thought I might as well pick up the phone a couple times and hang up and finally call to see if you want to, you know, have that coffee or, whatever, whatever you want to do.
BEN: Yes. Yes. Coffee would be great... tomorrow night... sure... Bye!
BEN: Oh, fine.
KATRINA: But we just got here. If you don't want to be here, why didn't we just stay in Dutton? Or we could've gone to my sister's.
WARREN: I don't want to hear about your sister's place again. Pack your stuff now.
KATRINA: Why the rush? It's real early. Are we even going to say good-bye to your mom?
WARREN: You can call her.
KATRINA: Warren, is there something going on you don't want me to see?
WARREN: Katrina, if you don't want to pack, that's fine. You can buy new stuff. Now let's just go.
BUFFY: I have to talk to you.
KATRINA: Who's this?
WARREN: Is this about her?
BUFFY: Yes.
KATRINA: Her who? Something's going on here -- strange girls--
WARREN: Trina, please be quiet. This is important. Wait in the kitchen.
KATRINA: And I'm not important? Warren, tell her to go away.
WARREN: I can't.
KATRINA: You're keeping secrets from me... other girls, who knows what else!
WARREN: Shut up, Trina!
KATRINA: Okay. That's it. Forget it, Warren. I'm gone.
BUFFY: My name is Buffy Summers. You were at Sunnydale High. Do you know who I am?
WARREN: Yes. I know. April. Did she hurt someone?
BUFFY: Not yet. Well, no one that matters.
WARREN: She's looking for me, you know. She followed me here.
BUFFY: Okay, kinda figured that out.
WARREN: There's more. Something you need to know about her.
BUFFY: I know.
WARREN: No, wait. Something important.
BUFFY: Believe me, I worked it out.
WARREN: No. This is something you can't possibly know.
WARREN: She's a robot.
BUFFY: Y'uh-huh.
DAWN: A robot? Really? Is it Ted? 'Cuz I always said there could've been more than one of him.
WILLOW: Nope. Whole new robot. This one's a girl.
XANDER: (to Dawn) Buffy's busy tracking down the guy that made her, so I'll drop you off at school and if she's not finished --
SPIKE: Fire! Fire!
SPIKE: Hallo all. What's going on, then?
GILES: You're not welcome here, Spike.
WILLOW: Yeah, and by the way, we're working on a way to de-invite you from here, too, even if it is a public place.
XANDER: Nah, forget that. Letting him in is good, 'cuz then we get to toss him out.
ANYA: Oh! Can we throw him through the window like the robot did? 'Cuz that was neat.
SPIKE: Robot. That what she was? Knew that wasn't right. I've still got a limp, look--
SPIKE: Hey, <u>someone</u> who's glad to see me. Aren't you, Little Bit?
DAWN: (clenched teeth) Get away from me.
TARA: I think you better go.
SPIKE: Okay, now I was afraid of this. Misrepresentations. Misunderstandings. Slurs and allegations. See, I don't know what Buffy told you, but the thing was, the Slayer and I worked together, side by side, to get rid of Dru, who was up to no good, I don't mind telling you--
GILES: Spike. Listen to me.
SPIKE: It's just, I'm trying to explain that she might have said some things that sounded like I expressed some kind of--
GILES: We are not your friends. We are not your way to Buffy. There is no way to Buffy.
GILES: Now clear out of here. And Spike, this thing... get over it.
SPIKE: Don't know what you mean--
GILES: Yes. You do. <u>Move the hell on</u>.
BUFFY: They don't want to talk to you, you're not getting dates, and you start thinking, "this isn't fair."
WARREN: Well, yeah, I felt like I deserve to have someone, you know? Everyone deserves to have someone.
BUFFY: So, naturally, you turned to manufacturing.
WARREN: Kinda.
BUFFY: How long did it take you to build yourself that little toy?
WARREN: She's not a toy. I mean, I know what you're thinking. But she's more than that.
BUFFY: I'm sure there are many exciting labor-saving attachments--
WARREN: No! I mean, I made her to love me. She cares about what I care about and she wants to be with me. She listens to me and supports me. I didn't make a toy, I made a girlfriend.
BUFFY: A girlfriend? Are you saying you two... are you in love with her?
WARREN: I really thought I would be. I mean, she's perfect. But it's just... I don't know. It was too easy and predictable. She got boring. She was exactly what I wanted and I didn't want her. I thought I was going crazy.
BUFFY: Really? You?
WARREN: Then something happened. Katrina was in my engineering seminar, and she was really funny and cool -- she was always giving me a hard time, real unpredictable. She builds these little model monorails that run with magnets. Anyway, I fell in love with Katrina.
BUFFY: Swell. Romance and magnet trains. But first, you took April out of the box, played with her for five minutes and got bored. So what did you do, dump her? Tell her to go away?
WARREN: Kind of.
BUFFY: And she got mad? Wouldn't go?
WARREN: Um... okay... I didn't really dump her so much as I... went out and didn't come back. I left her... I left her in my dorm room.
BUFFY: You left her in your dorm room?!
WARREN: I figured if I could just kinda get away 'til her batteries gave up, which should have been days ago...
BUFFY: Did you even tell her? Did you even give her a chance to fix what was wrong?
WARREN: I didn't need to fix anything! Her batteries were supposed to run down, really! They should completely be dead by now!
BUFFY: So why aren't they?
WARREN: I don't know. Maybe... maybe she's recharging them somehow.
BUFFY: Listen, Warren, this is important. Is she dangerous?
WARREN: She's only programmed to be in love.
BUFFY: Then she's dangerous. You have any idea how to find her?
WARREN: She's looking for me. So my guess is she's probably pretty close.
APRIL: Hi!
APRIL: Do you know where Warren is? I need to get to Warren.
KATRINA: Okay, this is getting insane. How many of you are there?
APRIL: There's only me. April.
KATRINA: April. Fine. Listen up, April. Warren is my boyfriend. Mine. And you others probably ought to figure that-- Ow!
KATRINA: Let go! That hurts!
APRIL: Don't go! You have to stay and tell the truth!
KATRINA: What-- stop!
APRIL: You're a liar. He can't be your boyfriend. Say that he's my boyfriend!
KATRINA: I can't... I can't breathe...  let go...
APRIL: (confused) You need to stop lying.
SPIKE: Damn right, I'll move on.
WARREN: (calls) April? April, are you there? (to Buffy) If the batteries are still working, and she hears my voice, she'll answer.
BUFFY: She's, like, voice-activated?
WARREN: Well, I made it so if she heard me and she didn't answer... it causes this kind of feedback.
BUFFY: If you call her and she doesn't answer, it hurts her. You're one creepy little dweeb, Warren…
WARREN: (calls) April!
APRIL: Warren!
WARREN: April.
APRIL: (scared) Where have you been?
APRIL: I couldn't find you and this girl kept lying to me, and then she went to sleep.
WARREN: April... what did you do?
APRIL: Please don't be angry, Warren. I'm trying very hard to make you happy.
BUFFY: April. I want you to put the girl down.
APRIL: Warren? What should I do?
BUFFY: (to Warren) Talk to her.
WARREN: Put her down. This is Buffy. Give Katrina to Buffy.
APRIL: Is she broken?
BUFFY: She's alive.
WARREN: Thank God.
APRIL: Warren, honey? What's going on? Why did you go away? Is it a game?
WARREN: No. This isn't a game.
APRIL: Did I do something wrong? I waited a long time and you didn't come back. A long time. I made you five sweaters.
WARREN: That's great. You could go back there and get them. You could wait there--
BUFFY: Warren. You have to tell her. Do it right.
APRIL: What is she saying? What do you need to tell me?
WARREN: April. It was my mistake.
APRIL: You can't make mistakes.
WARREN: But I did. I thought I made you everything I wanted. But it wasn't what I really wanted.
WARREN: (on Robot vision) I'm sorry. But it's over.
APRIL: But I can be whatever you want. I love you. I'll do whatever you want. Would you like a neck rub?
WARREN: April, I know you love me, but the truth is, I can't love you. It isn't your fault, but... I don't love you.
WARREN: (on Robot vision) I love <u>her</u>!
BUFFY: (to Warren) She growls? You made her so she growls?
KATRINA: What's going on?
WARREN: Trina! Get away!
KATRINA: What... What is... that's a robot!
WARREN: She wasn't just for sex!
KATRINA: Is this... this is your ex- girlfriend? You <u>built</u> her?!
KATRINA: No! Get the hell away from me!
WARREN: Katrina! No! Listen to me...!
APRIL: You took my man! I'm going to kill you! I'm going to...
APRIL: I can't... can't crush... so tired...
APRIL: Warren? Where are you? What's happening to me?
BUFFY: Can you cry? I feel better if I cry sometimes. But, I don't know, maybe there's rust issues...
APRIL: Crying is blackmail. Good girlfriends don't cry.
BUFFY: Oh.
APRIL: I've rechecked everything. I did everything I was supposed to do. I was a good girlfriend.
BUFFY: I'm sure you were.
APRIL: I'm only supposed to love him. If I can't do that, what am I <u>for</u>? What do I exist for?
BUFFY: I don't know. It isn't fair. He wasn't fair to you.
APRIL: It's getting dark. It's so early to be dark.
BUFFY: Yeah.
APRIL: What if he comes back and he can't find me in the dark?
BUFFY: I'm here. I'll make sure he finds you.
APRIL: Maybe this is a girlfriend test. If I wait here patiently this time, he'll come back.
BUFFY: I'm sure he will. And he's going to say... he'll say that he's so sorry. He told me... He said he was proud of you and impressed with how much you love him and try to help him. He didn't mean to hurt you.
APRIL: He's going to take me home and things will be right again.
BUFFY: It'll be fine.
APRIL: When things are sad, you just have to be patient. Because... Because every cloud has a silver lining. And when life give you lemons you make lemonade...
BUFFY: Clouds and lemonade.
APRIL: Yes. And... and things are always darkest before...
XANDER: You construct a wood jamb and frame the glass in it, and that's what you set into the opening.
BUFFY: Yeah?
XANDER: And one of the cool things about that, you see, is that the jamb can be shimmed to be square even if the opening isn't.
BUFFY: "Shimmed?" Is that a word? Do you really know what you're talking about?
XANDER: Um, I do, yeah. Scary, isn't it? I think I've actually turned into someone you want around after a crazed robot attack.
BUFFY: And if you ever get your own business, you've got a slogan right there. (then) She wasn't crazed.
XANDER: Yeah? Hold this.
BUFFY: She was just... she devoted everything to making this one person happy. And then it was like, with him gone, there wasn't any reason for her to exist any more.
XANDER: Robots are the strangest people.
BUFFY: Nah -- people are the strangest people. I mean, I'm not that different from her. I've got so much more than her -- I've got this great life, all this power, all these friends, my family, but still, every time I don't have a boyfriend, I feel like someone took away my arms.
XANDER: You feel like that? Armless?
BUFFY: Well, kinda. I feel like something real important is missing. But it isn't. I mean, it is missing, but it isn't that important, you know?
XANDER: Buffy, you're acting like you're never gonna find someone, and that's nuts. Hey, there's lots of guys where I work. Now I'm guessing you don't want a lot of spitting--
BUFFY: No, see, I'm serious. I don't need a guy right now. I need me. If someone amazing comes along, fine, but I think I'd like to get comfortable being alone with Buffy.
XANDER: Well, I'll say this -- she's a pretty cool person to be alone with.
BUFFY: Thanks.
BUFFY: Hi. This is Buffy. I hope this is your machine... there wasn't a greeting, but anyway, about the going out for coffee...
GLORY: What the hell?
JINX: If I may, Your Inconceivableness, it sounds to these humble ears like our Ben tried to make a date with the Slayer.
GLORY: He... a <u>date</u> with the <u>Slayer</u>? No! No! No! He's planning something! He's working against me! (beat) <u>She turned us down</u>?
WARREN: (into phone) Trina? No, wait... I'm so sorry... Yes, I am so... just give me a chance to explain... yes... no... yes, but... Really, I'll do anything. No! Don't hang up!
WARREN: How'd you get in here?
SPIKE: Your mum let me in. I'm placing an order.
WARREN: I'm not making any more girls.
SPIKE: Sure you are. And here's your specs.
SPIKE: You're gonna make her real good for me.
