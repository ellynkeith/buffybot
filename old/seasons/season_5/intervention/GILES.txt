Nonsense. I quite like to cook, and helping out with the dishes makes me feel useful.
How… tempting.
How is she doing?
I'm so sorry. I can only say, it will get better.
Good. Routine can be very helpful…  In fact, maybe we should consider  returning to our training schedule.
You were doing so well.
Like what?
But you've mastered so much. Your strength and resilience are -
Turning you to stone? Buffy…?
Look, at a time like this you're bound to feel emotionally numb -
She knew. Always.
Buffy-
I shouldn't wonder. (then) How serious are you about this?
There is something. In the Watcher's Diaries. A Quest.
Not a grail. Maybe some answers. It would take a day, perhaps two. As your Watcher, I'd be part of it. There's an incantation.
A quest. Some of the Slayers before Buffy found it helpful in regaining their focus, learning more about their role. There's a sacred location in the nearby desert.
That's fairly common, actually. Sort of an equalization of forces.
Supplies.
How about a book, a gourd and a bundle of twigs.
They're for me. You see, the location of the sacred spot is a guarded secret. I can't take you there myself. I have to perform a ritual that will turn over my guardianship of you, temporarily, to a Guide…
Buffy, really. It takes more than a week to bleach bones.
(embarrassed) I… jump out of the circle, jump back in, and, and, shake my gourd.
Go. Quest.
(Swahili) …nilivyoahidi kulinda na  kuongoza, nakupokeza. Mpeleke afike mahali pa usalama na ujuzi. Mpe anavyohitaji. Mwonyeshe njia  (English) …that which I am pledged to guard and guide, I hand over to you. Lead her to a place of safety and learning. Give her that which she needs. Show her the path…
Quite extraordinary, really.
(hard 'G') "<u>G</u>iles"? Spike didn't even bother to program my name properly?!
Buffy! We're here!
Buffy!
We tried to find out if he told her about… anything… He was too badly beaten to make any sense.
(to Dawn) But there's no need to worry. I'm sure we're all perfectly safe.
