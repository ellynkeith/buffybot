Spike! Oh, Spike!
No.
I want to hurt you, but I can't resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular body.
No! Spike! Never let me go!
You are. You're very very bad.
No. This way.
I could never do it. I'm helpless against you, you fiend.
You're evil.
It excites me. It terrifies me. I try so hard to resist you, and I can't.
Darn your sinister attraction!
Since the beginning. I always trembled when I heard your voice.
Yes.
I think you can. I think you can if I let you. And I want to let you. I want you to bite me and devour me until there's no more.
Oh! Spike! Devour me.
Spike! I can't help myself! I love you!
Should I start this program over?
Time to Slay.
Okay! Vampires beware!
Hey there!
Xander! And…
Isn't it a beautiful night for killing evil things?
I don't understand that question, but thank you for asking! You're my friend and a carpenter.
(delighted) Spike! It's Spike! And he's wearing the coat!
Spike! Be careful!
No! Get away from him!
Yes! Spike and I will do it alone. You guys head home.
But I'm not. I'm all… my skin is all hot. Do I look hot to you?
You better feel me to make sure.
You're the Big Bad! You're the Big Bad!
Who's that?
(cheerful) Okay!
Spike? I waited like you said, but then I missed you!
Spike's gone.
I don't know where Xander is. I  didn't see him. And when I came up  from the tunnel, Spike was gone! Oh… (finding the name) Willow, I need to find him.
No. But I had sex with Spike. I'm sorry if it bothers you. You're my best friend.
You do?
It wasn't one time. It was lots of times. And lots of different ways. I could make sketches.
You're my best friend.
You're recently gay!
You're also good with computers! (then) That's very nice.
Yes? That's me!
We have to get him back.
I fight with weapons!
I live here!
Those are my weapons. Give me something big and sharp.
She's a God! She wants the Key!
I don't know! Why are you all looking at me?
We need to rescue Spike!
I can do that! I'll be right back.
Spike is mine! Who's straddling Spike?
Say, look at you! You look like me! (confidentially) We're very pretty.
(mildly skeptical) Oh, I don't think I'm a robot.
People! Friends of mine! You're forgetting the important thing! Glory has Spike and she's going to harm him!
Thank you, but I think we should be listening to the other Buffy, (with a hard 'G') <u>G</u>iles. She's very smart and she's going to save Spike!
You're right. He's evil. Killing him is the only way. We're the Slayer and that's what we do. (then) But you should see him naked. I mean, really. Can we save him now, please?
Spike! Spike's in there!
I fell down and got confused but  Willow fixed me. She's gay! And then  I felt the pull of your sinister attraction.
They were confused, too. Do you want to ravage me?
Why did you let that Glory hurt you?
I can tell her! Then you won't -
Why?
