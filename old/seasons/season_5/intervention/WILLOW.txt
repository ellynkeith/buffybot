It's got last week's notes too. Just get it back to me by Thursday. And don't, uh, write in it, or put a coffee mug down on it… or spill… okay.
(re: the program) Those darn Salem judges! With their less-Satanic-than-thou attitudes…
What's going on?
What? What did she do?
(struggling to understand) Oh. Well, Tara's right, grief can be powerful and we shouldn't judge -
It's not healthy. We're all agreeing there.
Xander, what took so-
Shh. Buffy, it's late. Come in…
Um… Buffy? This thing with Spike. It isn't true, is it? You didn't really, you know, sleep with Spike.
I am. I always will be, too, no matter what you do. And I'm trying to figure out why this happened. And I think I might have an idea.
I think maybe, with your mom and everything, everyone was being all sympathetic, making you feel weak. But Spike wasn't like that. So, just one time, you kind of did something crazy-
No! Buffy. There's something seriously wrong here. I mean, yeah, you've been with a vampire before, but Angel had a soul-
O-kay. Look, I just want to help you. Let me help you.
Yes, again, I really am. And I think maybe you need to talk to someone about this. A professional-
Um… what?
Um-
But he knows about Dawn!
Tara, will you stay and watch over Dawny?
And don't let her know about…
Buffy? Where should we go? Where Should we look for Glory?
Um… Buffy? I think you have more weapons upstairs. You could go get those…
Well, what <u>are</u> we going to do?
Whatever we do, we're going to need Buffy's help.
Intervention time again?
That was quick.
She's fine.
Wait. This shouldn't be about blame.
No, there's only love. And some fear.
Two of them!
Yikes. Imagine the things-
But we don't even know where to look.
So you think she lives near here?
Uh… yeah.
Hey! I think I found something.
I found where she's broken. There's some wiring that got fried extra crispy. That's an easy fix - I mean, not that I would.
