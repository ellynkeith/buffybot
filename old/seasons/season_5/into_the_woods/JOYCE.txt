Well that's a comfort.
I must be getting better. You're making fun of me again.

Fair enough. But you don't have to keep me company all night. Go have fun. Get Riley to take you to a movie or something.
I don't think he thinks of you as a chore, Buffy.
(a little unsure) Well - good. As long as you two are getting come quality time with... the Lord.
