Hey, hey!-
Was that the <u>Slayer</u>?
What the hell do you think you're doing, bringing the slayer here?!
She knows where my operation is, it's over. Nobody's going to risk coming here.
You working with her - is that it? I knew you were too vanilla for this scene-
The pyro act was a bad idea, Slayer.
I'm not running. And you're not shutting me down.
In fact - you're not going to make it through the night.
