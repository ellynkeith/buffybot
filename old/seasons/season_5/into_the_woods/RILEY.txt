I'm fine. Thanks.
It doesn't mean anything.
I'd worry more if your mom was out of surgery quickly. It might mean there wasn't much they could do.
Whatever you want.
Absolutely.
Already? I had that scheduled for a little later on.
Always.
I want tonight to be special for you.
I'm glad. You deserve it after everything you've been through.
But it was a lot. And you were incredible.
Don't sell yourself short. You stayed strong the whole time, Buffy. You never even cried.
Oh.
<u>Harder</u>.
Buffy-
Buffy!
<u>Back off</u>. I didn't-
(intense) Back off, man, or-
Get out.
I'm not in the talking mood.
Talk fast.
And you're telling me this because...
I'm a civilian.
I quit the government a long way back.
What do you need me for?
You may have noticed Spike, I left reasonable about three exits back.
Why the hell not?
Plastic wood grain. Looks real, doesn't it?
You think I don't know what's going on with you, Spike? Stay away from her - or we're doing this for real next time.
What?
Because you are.
Maybe I didn't almost kill you enough-
(hard) Shut up-
Do you actually think you've got a shot with her?
You touch her, you know I'd kill you, for real.
I'm the lucky guy. Yeah.
I'm the guy.
Is she in there?
Would you guys mind clearing out? I need a minute alone with Buffy.
We need to talk.
Too bad.
So let's fight. We need to have this out, Buffy. Right now.
I realize that. I don't expect... I just need you to hear me out.
I think - I... when this thing started, it was just some stupid, immature game. I wanted to even the score after you let Dracula bite you-
(cutting her off) I know. On some level I know that. But I was still spun, and, I don't know... I wanted to know what you felt, I wanted to know why Angel and Dracula had so much power over you-
Exactly. Which is why I let the first one bite me... I wanted to get it, Buffy. I wanted to get <u>you</u>-
This isn't your fault. It's mine. And I feel like hell for what I've put you through. But it's just - these girls-
(ignoring) They made me feel something. Something I didn't even know I was missing until-
You need to hear this-
They <u>needed</u> me, Buffy-
No - on some basic level it was about me. My blood. My body. When they bit me, it was beyond passion... They wanted to devour me, all of me-
It wasn't real. I know. It was just physical. But the fact that I craved it, that I kept going back... Even if it was fleeting - they made me feel like they had such hunger for me...
I know exactly what they feel when they bite me - because I feel it every time we're together. It's like the whole world falls away - and all there is is you.
(cutting her off) You keep me at a distance Buffy. You didn't even call me when your mom went into the hospital.
It's about <u>me</u> taking care of <u>you</u>! It's about letting me in, so you don't have to be on top of everything all the time-
It's hard sometimes, yes. But that's not it-
(anguished) You say that, but I don't feel it.
They want me back, Buffy. The military. It's deep undercover. No contact with civilians. (then) The transport's leaving tonight.
I'm telling you now.
I don't know. If we can't work this out...
I'm not. I-
I don't. Buffy-
That's not what I meant-
I'm not asking you to-
What? Hit me? Go ahead.
(hard) Come on, do it.
I'm serious, Buffy. Hit me. <u>Hit me</u>.
I'm leaving, Buffy. Unless you give me a reason to stay, I'm leaving tonight.
