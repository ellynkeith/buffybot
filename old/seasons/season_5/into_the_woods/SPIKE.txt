It's me.
I wouldn't be here if I didn't have a good reason. As usual I'm here to help you and are you naked under there?
I'm serious- Not about the naked part, I mean...
I want to show you something.
You need to see it.
It is. (then) But we have to move if we want to get there in time.
(scoffing) Please. Like I give a bloody damn.
Just having a little look, mate. Keep it down.
I said, <u>keep it down</u>.
(mock sincere) We only came here because we care about you, friend. You need help.
I thought you should know. I-
What took you? Guess it takes a while to get to full strength after those bites-
(alarmed) Hey. Hey. Let's be reasonable about this.
Look, I'm not the one who got you into this. I mean, don't kill the messenger-
Owwww! Ohhhh, God- (getting it) <u>Hey</u>.
Oh... man... you're really under it, aren't you?
Look at you. All afraid I'm hot for your honey...
Well - yeah! But that's not your problem. Even if I wasn't in the picture, you're never going to be able to hold onto her...
Ahhhh! Bloody hell-
Come on. You're not the long haul guy and you know it-
You know it, or you wouldn't be getting suck jobs from two bit vampire trulls.
Girl needs some monster in her man, and it's not in your nature. No matter how low you try to go.
No, I don't. Fellow's gotta do what he can, though. Got to try.
I had this chip out, I'd a killed you long ago. (beat) Ain't love grand.
Sometimes I envy you so much it chokes me. And then sometimes I think I've got the better deal. To be that close to her and not have her... To be all alone even when you're holding her, feeling her, feeling her beneath you, surrounding you, the scent of -- no, you've got the better deal.
