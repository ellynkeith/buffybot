And I've always wanted piano lessons. So really, who's surprised we have all this unexpressed rage?
But honestly? I think I'm expressing mine better. Tell you what:
You go find yourself a good anger management class...
And I'll jam this pokey wood stick through your heart.
Think that sets the world speed record for closure.
Oh. Yeah, darn, and my fellow ravers will be so disappointed. (confidential) My turn to bring bundt cake.
I'm already gone.
Right. Thanks.
I'll let you know when I find out.
Dawn! Touch nothing.
Look: Mom's sick, I made her a nice, non-instant breakfast for once, and I don't want you...
...doing that.
I didn't "help."
We just knew you were feeling less than great, so...
What'd your doctors say?
So they don't know what's wrong.
That's unacceptable. We need a second opinion.
Okay. Let's go now.
(to Joyce) You ever have names for me?
Bigger than big. It's his "Grand Opening" day.
You guys have a book club?
I'm in. What's it called?
I'll be back later. Your doctor's appointment's for when?
I just want to know! Take it easy. Feet up, plenty of Oprah.
Changed my mind.
(angry, to Dawn) Go. Browse. And...
(distracted) Oh yeah. Money, hand over fist.
Which, I guess is a good thing.
Slayer-wise, I'm tip-top. But Mom's still sick, and we don't know what the deal is.
Oh yeah. Got a whole, highly trained medical staff working round the clock to tell us diddly.
Actually, I've got a little scooby- centric deal to deal with first.
I put it before the group... What the hell is this?
Found it on patrol.
Uh... sure.
No I didn't.
(covering) Yeah, but I wasn't talking about...
(to Dawn) We're going.
Why?
Yeah but she's so annoying, especially now Mom's sick and Dawn's all over her, while I have to be the grown-up, and they're like the giggle twins and how come I never get to be the Little Pumpkin Belly?
Like Dawn even cares what -- You have no idea how much I wish I were an only child these days.
Shh. Mom?
Mom!
Come on. I'm taking you to the doctors.
No! You don't know that! We don't know anything. Come on.
Hospital pharmacy open?
Ten minutes.
(no clue) Um...?
Oh. Um...
How'd you guess?
HEY!
I've met this guy. He's not crazy.
(stunned) What do you mean?
Huh? Oh. Yeah.
Not yet. She will be.
I'm starting to figure out what's wrong.
Giles. I have an idea what's making my mom sick.
They won't find anything. What's hurting her: it's supernatural.
The Nightwatchman who found this thing went crazy. Like, overnight. Something made him that way.
This won't hurt us, I had it on me all night. But this guy. Giles, he saw things. Said things.
They'll come at me through my family.
I don't know. Yet. But whatever touched this guy made him see through what the rest of us are seeing. He knew. Someone's hurting my mom, and they're trying to get to me.
It's a start. We have to find out who's making my mom sick, and how.
I hunt them. Find them. And kill them.
Someone put a spell on my Mom. Something to make her look like she's sick.
Got the list narrowed down to just under infinity.
"Rotate many foodstuffs?"
What do you mean, "see spells?"
Okay. So I'll just do what the Monsieur Silk Knickers did. Go home, get trancey, see what's affecting my Mom.
Better than mine? I knew you'd say that, but we've been practicing concentration drills. I know I'm close.
It's my mom. I'll get ready. (to Anya) What do I need?
Thanks again for coming. I totally appreciate the help.
Lots. Tons. Lots and lots of tons. This is all kind of, uh...
(nods) All prayin', no slayin'. So, let's see... the incense needs to be "ignited," and that's a job, then this stuff gets poured round me counter-clockwise, and um, ...
Magic incense and spooky sand. And, the ritual itself is...
Kitten<i>ny</i>.
I know...
I know you can handle yourself. I just didn't want to see you get hurt.
Done.
A girl needs more luck than that.
My boyfriend! Now go away!
No I'm not.
No you can't.
No!
Go, go tell, go wherever you want...
Mom.
Going out?
Nothing...
There's nothing.
Huh? Oh. Yeah. I mean, I'm fine. Long day's all. You, um, have a good time.
<b>You're not my sister</b>.
What are you?
You want to hurt me?
Then you deal with me.
You - stay away from my mother.
What.
Go on.
Any word what this evil looks like?
I'm going down to the factory where I found it. Whoever planted this doohickey's got answers.
That's the thing. I just saw...
Nothing. Didn't work.
Slayer stuff.
I'm going out.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'll be home in an hour.
I'll be back first.
Spike!
Look, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but...
What are you doing here?
Five words or less.
Outside my house. At night. (sighs) No one has time for this, <i>William</i>.
Fine. Keep going, I cut you a break.
(to herself) Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in...
...Not by the hairs of my chinny chin chin...
...then I'll huff, and I'll puff...
Whoa.
Hey. It was you, planted the thing, the... Dagon's Sphere, right? I have it. We're not alone, I've got friends who can help you. Don't worry.
I'm stronger than I look.
I've got some experience with stuff like this.
And best of all...
I'm not stupid.
We gotta keep moving.
(tough soldier) Don't get metaphory on me. We're going.
Protect the Key. Right. I know, we'll do it together! Far, far from here.
How? What is it?
That round glowy thing?
Dawn.
You put that thing in my home.
My memories... my mom's...
<u>Then unbuild them</u>. This is my life you're --
I didn't ask for this. I don't even know what... what is she?
She's not my sister.
Nothing, Mom.
Just sister stuff.
Come on, Dawn.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Really sorry.
That's your theory?
I'm sorry, okay?
Can't even take an apology. You always do that, ever since --
I just had a bad day.
Can I be president?
Okay.
Mmm?
I don't know.
