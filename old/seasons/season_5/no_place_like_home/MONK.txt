(accented english) I... I will tell you... (spits) Nothing.
Stop. Please...
My journey's done, I think.
You have to... The Key. You must protect The Key.
Many have... died... many more, if you don't... keep it safe...
The Key is energy. It's a portal. It opens the door...
(shakes his head) For centuries it had no form at all. My brethren... its only keepers. Then...
The abomination... found us. We had to hide The Key... Gave it form. Molded it flesh, made it human. And sent it to you.
(nods) She is The Key.
We knew the Slayer would... protect...
We built them.
You cannot... abandon...
Human. Human, now, and helpless. Please, she is... an innocent in this, and she needs you.
She doesn't know that.
