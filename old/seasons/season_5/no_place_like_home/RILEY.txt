The hype was out of control.
May be more where that came from. I say we go back out again tonight.
Don't worry about it.
Giles, you got that danger room set up out back? I'm feeling the need for a little physical re-hab about now.
Sure thing. So, what do I do?
...new terrain?
So you need me to light incense and pour sand?
Something you do alone.
You sure this isn't just your way of trying to make me feel less... what's the words? Cute and weak and kittenish?
Right. Much manlier. Look:
I really am okay.
So I'm not quite super-guy anymore. That was borrowed power anyway, I had to give it back sometime.
Maybe instead of you trying to take care of me, we agree to try taking care of each other. Deal?
Good.
For luck.
Have a nice trip.
