I'm not going in.
This isn't about Buffy-
They're for Joyce.
(re: flowers) Care? Joyce was the only one of  the lot of you that I could <u>stand</u>.
I liked the lady. Understand, monkey  boy? She was decent. Didn't put on  airs. Always had a nice cuppa for me…  And she never treated me like a freak.
Think what you want.
If the spell calls for anything more  than that you're into Zombie territory  and that's bad news.
I know good and well what you're  up to. That book you're holding is  infamous.
I'm not going to tell, little bit.  I'm going to help.
I've never used this bloke's services  myself - but there's talk. Word is,  he knows everything there is to  know about resurrection spells.
(gently) Come on now. No worries.
Do you now? Enlighten me.
Do you want my help or not?
Then don't go guessing at stuff  you don't understand. And Buffy  never hears about this, okay? She  found out what I was doing, she'd drive a redwood through my chest.
Don't like to see Summers women  take it so hard on the chin, is all. (then/hard) And I'm dead serious. You breathe  a word of this to Buffy and I'll see  to it that <u>you</u> end up in the ground,  got it?
Fine. Let's get on with it then.
(calling out) Hey! Anybody home?
Don't think so, mate.
Can't say that I am. Look, we came because-
(indicating Dawn) This one's mum kicked it a few  days back.
We're wondering what can be done  about it. Heard you're the one to ask.
Can you help or not, old man?  We have to act fast.
Ghora… I've heard of those. They local?
Where do we find this demon?
And the Ghora?
So at least we know the old  coot isn't completely daft. (then) Look. You'd better let me  snatch this egg thing on my own.
No. You're not. I've got no idea  what's down there. I deliver you  back to your sister in pieces, that'd  be the end of me - wouldn't it?
I'll manage.
Well, look at that - bitty Buffy.
Wait 'til it wakes up. That's usually  when the bad starts.
I'll make it move. You just be ready.
(to Ghora) Hey! Ghora! Heads up!
Right then. Heads it is.
Leave it, Dawn. Troika there  knows what we're after-
It's too dangerous, and I don't have-
-a weapon.
(pained) Did you get it?
Don't be sorry then.
