(exasperated) Tell my sister I'm sick of running into  her Jawa rejects.
Skip the lips to her backside. Just say it. Glory.
We don't have a relationship. I've seen  her around, that's all.
You're more fun when I hit you.
And why would I share that with The  Most Unstable One?
Fine. Let the best me win. (then) Let Glory understand this. I'm not helping  her find the Key. I would never do that to  an innocent-
No. That's not what I-
You understand what? When I said  it's innocent… I didn't mean that the  Key is… It's not a person.
You're going to run and tell her, aren't  you? Do you understand what's going  to happen if she finds the Key? How  many people are going to die? I  won't be responsible-
I <u>can't</u> let that happen. Don't you see?
I can't…
