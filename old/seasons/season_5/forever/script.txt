GILES: Buffy. There you are…
GILES: Are you alright?
BUFFY: (looking at casket) Yeah. I…
DIRECTOR: Did you find something?
BUFFY: (nods &amp; points) That one.
DIRECTOR: That model is beautiful. In fact, all of the caskets in this room are  top of the line. (gently) However, given your budget, it might not be the-
DIRECTOR: It's a fine choice. It speaks to  your deep feeling for the deceased.
BUFFY: You don't like it?
DAWN: It's not that. It's just - what if mom… What if she'd like something else better?
BUFFY: Dawn-
DAWN: I mean, how do we know? For sure? She's the one who has to be in it forever.
BUFFY: Dawn. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea, you coming along…
DAWN: It's fine. It's just-
BUFFY: I'm serious. You shouldn't have  to deal with this stuff-
DIRECTOR: If you'd like a few more minutes  to decide-
BUFFY: (quickly) No. It's fine. It's done. (to Dawn) Okay?
BUFFY: Okay…
GILES: (to Buffy) I checked prices with a few  different florists. The funeral  home is competitive.
BUFFY: Let's just go with them, then.  It's simpler.
DAWN: What color flowers?
BUFFY: White. They're nice. (to Giles) What about an announcement?  People are going to be expecting  a wake after the burial if we  don't say something.
GILES: We could put a line in the program.  Expressing your mother's preference  not to have one.
WILLOW: There's no wake?
BUFFY: Mom didn't like them. (smiles a little) She said pot lucks are depressing  enough as it is.
DAWN: She said that? When?
BUFFY: Right before she went in for her  operation. We had a talk about  what she wanted. In case…
DAWN: She never said anything to me.
XANDER: I'm sure she just didn't want to  upset you, Dawnster. (then) Now you better get working on  that dinner. You've barely touched it.
DAWN: I'm not feeling very casserole-y.
XANDER: That's a shame. 'Cause you've got  about 9000 of them in the kitchen.  You could open your very own  Casserole Hut.
WILLOW: (to Dawn) Mrs. Kaplan brought some enchiladas  over. Or there's chicken stuff. I saw  chicken stuff.
DAWN: That's okay. I'm not really hungry.
XANDER: (helping himself to more) Shouldn't stop you. Eating can provide  pleasant numbness.
BUFFY: You should eat, Dawn.
DAWN: Why should I? You're not.
BUFFY: This isn't about-
BUFFY: I'm phoned out. Can you? I mean,  unless it's Dad.
GILES: Of course.
GILES: Hello? Yes… They did. Thank you…  The service is tomorrow at three. Do  you know the Brown Brothers Mortuary?…
BUFFY: I can't believe he hasn't called yet.
XANDER: Your Dad's still AWOL, huh?
BUFFY: (nods) The number he left for us in Spain is  no good. And I've left messages all  over the place.
DAWN: We should try his girlfriend's place-
BUFFY: I don't have that number. I told you.
DAWN: But we could ask one of his friends at  work or something.
BUFFY: Dawn. I tried that. Okay? (to Willow and Xander) What do you think? Just a line that  says "following the burial, there will  be no wake-" or gathering? "there  will be no gathering at the request of  Joyce?" That's lame.
DAWN: What are we going to do - after? I mean, we're not just coming back  here are we?
BUFFY: I guess. I don't know. How about "At  the request of the family, there will be  no wake following the burial?"
XANDER: Good. It's got flow.
DAWN: I don't want to come back here.
BUFFY: Where do I put it? On top, here?  Or on the bottom?
DAWN: (to Willow) Maybe I could go to your place tomorrow?
WILLOW: Tomorrow?
DAWN: Yeah. After everything? I don't want to come back to the house and stuff. I don't want to be here.
WILLOW: But maybe you and Buffy should… It's  sort of a question for your sister. It's  fine with me.
DAWN: (to Buffy) Can I?
BUFFY: Humm?
DAWN: Can I go to Willow's tomorrow after the service?
BUFFY: If you want. I guess so…
DAWN: I'll get my sleeping bag out of the attic.
WILLOW: Dawn?
DAWN: It's for mom.
BUFFY: (to Giles) Do we call the post office about  this? Maybe we need to fill out  a form or something.
XANDER: You going home?
WILLOW: I'm stopping by my mom's first.  Been doing that a lot.
XANDER: Yeah. I thought maybe I'd stop by your mom's too. (off Willow's look) Well, I'm not going to <u>my</u> house.  Those people are scary-
XANDER: Speaking of.
XANDER: You've got to be kidding.
SPIKE: I'm not going in.
XANDER: And you're not leaving those. This  isn't the time for your crap, Spike.  You actually think you're going to  score points with Buffy this way?
SPIKE: This isn't about Buffy-
XANDER: Bull. We're all hip to your doomed  obsession. You're rising to new lows,  man. Or, lowering… towards them.
SPIKE: They're for Joyce.
XANDER: Like you care about her.
WILLOW: Guys - not here.
SPIKE: (re: flowers) Care? Joyce was the only one of  the lot of you that I could <u>stand</u>.
XANDER: And the only one with a daughter  you wanted to shag. I'm touched.
SPIKE: I liked the lady. Understand, monkey  boy? She was decent. Didn't put on  airs. Always had a nice cuppa for me…  And she never treated me like a freak.
XANDER: Her mistake.
SPIKE: Think what you want.
XANDER: (fuming) Unbelievable. Guy thinks he can put on  a big show and con Buffy into being his  sex monkey…
WILLOW: He didn't leave a card.
MINISTER: <i>…we commend to almighty God  our sister Joyce Summers…</i>
MINISTER: <i>…and we commit her body to the  ground…</i>
MINISTER: <i>…earth to earth…</i>
MINISTER: <i>…ashes to ashes…</i>
MINISTER: <i>…Dust to dust…</i>
TARA: Hey. Dawn is kind of ready to go…  Is it okay if we take her?
BUFFY: Yeah. She should probably get out of here.
TARA: What about you? We can wait, if you want.
BUFFY: I'm okay. Thanks.
ANGEL: I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner.
WILLOW: There you go. (pats the floor) Best mattress in the house. Good for the back.
TARA: How about something for your tummy,  Dawn? Aren't you hungry at all?
DAWN: No. Thanks.
WILLOW: Oh… Dawn. This just sucks,  doesn't it? I wish I could help more.  (off her silence) The only thing is, it'll get better.  I promise. It'll take time - but it  won't hurt so much after a while.
DAWN: You don't know that.
TARA: Sure she does. We're witches. We know stuff.
DAWN: (a little angry) So - what? Life just goes on and I  forget mom? Is that what you're saying?
WILLOW: Not forget. No. You…
TARA: You make a place in your heart for  her. It's sort of like she becomes part  of you. In the things she showed you  and taught you… The way you live  your life. Does that make sense?
WILLOW: Dawn?
WILLOW: (anxious) Hey. We don't have to talk about it.  We can just go to sleep.
DAWN: No.
DAWN: I don't want to sleep.
TARA: Okay. We can just sit.  Whatever you want.
DAWN: Good, because I know. What I  want to do now.
WILLOW: Great. What are you up for?
DAWN: Well, you're witches… And  you do magic and stuff…
WILLOW: You want us to teach you something? A glamour or - or I can make a stuffed animal dance-
DAWN: I want to do a spell. (beat) I want to bring Mom back.
ANYA: Umm.
XANDER: Umm hum.
ANYA: That was different.
XANDER: Yeah…
ANYA: In a better way.
XANDER: It was more… intense. Very intense, actually.
ANYA: It's because of Joyce.
XANDER: Right, I- (stops) Huh?
ANYA: She died. She's gone forever.
XANDER: Yeah. I kinda picked up on that.
ANYA: Well, she got me thinking… About  how people die all the time… And  how they get born too… And how  you kind of need one so you can  have the other.
XANDER: True. It would get kind of crowdy  and stinky on Earth if nobody vacated.
ANYA: And when I think about it that way,  it makes death a little less sad and  sex a little more exciting.
XANDER: Again I say - huh?
ANYA: Well, I just feel like I understand sex  more. It isn't just about two bodies  smooshing together. It's about life.
XANDER: Got it. What makes you feel more  alive than the good stuff?
ANYA: Exactly. Sex is like a big party for  our aliveness. But it's more than that.  It's about <u>making</u> life.
XANDER: (alarmed) Right. When two people are much  older and way richer and far less stupid-
ANYA: Breathe. You're turning colors. (then) I'm not ready to make life with you.  But I could, <u>we</u> could. Life could  come out of love and our smooshing  and that's beautiful… It all makes me  feel like we're part of something bigger.  Like I'm more awake somehow, you know?
XANDER: Yeah. I do.
TARA: Of course you want to bring your  mother back. And I wish we could.  But it's not possible.
DAWN: Why? You guys do magic for all  kinds of things.
WILLOW: We do, but…
TARA: This is different. Magic can't be  used to alter the natural order of things-
DAWN: All you do is mess with the natural  order of things! You make things  float and disappear and, and-
TARA: (interrupting) But we don't mess with life and death.  Dawn - I know how bad you hurt-
DAWN: You don't! They put her in the <u>ground</u>-
TARA: They did, and it's awful and unfair -  but this isn't the way.
WILLOW: I'm not even sure it's possible, Dawn.  I mean, I've seen things about resurrection.  There are books and stuff…
WILLOW: But I guess… the spells backfire?
TARA: That's not the point-
WILLOW: (quickly/to Dawn) That's not the point. The point is, it's bad. Because…
TARA: Because witches can't be allowed to  alter the fabric of life that way, for  selfish reasons. We'd manipulate the  world until it came unglued. (to Dawn) You can't understand this now - I  don't expect you to… But as painful  as death is, it's part of nature. Wiccans took an oath, a long time ago, to honor that-
DAWN: So it is possible then. To bring someone  back. They wouldn't have taken an oath  if they didn't know they could do it-
TARA: (firmer) Maybe "they" could, but <u>we</u> can't. Even  if it wasn't wrong, it's the most advanced  form of dark arts. Way beyond our grasp.
WILLOW: (a bit reluctant) She's right, Dawn. It's too dangerous.  We can't go there.
DAWN: (to Willow) You said you wanted to help me.
WILLOW: Dawn-
DAWN: <u>Don't</u>.
BUFFY: …the funeral was… It was brutal…  But what I'm really worried about  is tomorrow.
ANGEL: What's tomorrow?
BUFFY: That's what I don't know. Up 'til  now I've had a road map - things  to do, every minute, that had to do  with mom…
ANGEL: And tomorrow the stuff of everyday  living resumes.
BUFFY: (nods) Which everybody expects me to know  how to do because I'm so "strong."
ANGEL: Not right away. I'm sure everybody  understands that you need time.
BUFFY: Time's not the issue. I'm good at  sticking wood in vampires, but Mom  was the strong one in real life. She  always knew how to make things better,  what to say…
ANGEL: You'll find your way. Not all at once, but…
BUFFY: I don't know… (desperate) I keep thinking about it, Angel. When  I found her. If I'd gotten there ten  minutes earlier-
ANGEL: You said they told you it wouldn't  have made a difference.
BUFFY: No. Probably wouldn't have made  a difference. The exact thing they  said was <u>probably</u>. I haven't told  anyone that-
ANGEL: That doesn't make it your fault.  You couldn't have done anything  different.
BUFFY: (anguished) I didn't even start CPR until they  told me to. I fell apart. That's  how good I am at being a grown up.
ANGEL: Buffy-
BUFFY: If I just had me to worry about…  But Dawn…
ANGEL: It's okay. It's okay. You don't feel  like it now, but you <u>are</u> strong, Buffy.  You're going to figure it out. And  you have people to help you. You  don't have to do it alone.
BUFFY: It's going to be light soon.
ANGEL: I can stay in town. As long as you  want me.
BUFFY: How's forever? Is forever good for you? (then) There's a bad idea. I'm seriously  needy right now.
ANGEL: Let me worry about the neediness.  I can handle it.
BUFFY: Told you. (reluctantly) You'd better go.
ANGEL: (pained) I'm sorry.
BUFFY: Don't be. I'm so grateful you came,  Angel. I didn't think I was going to  make it through the night.
ANGEL: We have a few more minutes until I have to go.
BUFFY: Good.
BUFFY: Good…
BEN: (exasperated) Tell my sister I'm sick of running into  her Jawa rejects.
JINX: But, sir, the Most Delightfully Mood  Enhancing Glor-
BEN: Skip the lips to her backside. Just say it. Glory.
JINX: Yes, well - she bade me come to you.  The news of your relationship with the  slayer-
BEN: We don't have a relationship. I've seen  her around, that's all.
JINX: But you attempted to court her, did you not?
BEN: You're more fun when I hit you.
JINX: (cutting to the chase) It's just, The Lovely And- (off Ben's look) Glory would like to encourage this  interest of yours in the slayer. It  might lead to information about the Key.
BEN: And why would I share that with The  Most Unstable One?
JINX: Time is running short, sir. Every moment  you fight Glory, you're only fighting  yourself, you see?
BEN: Fine. Let the best me win. (then) Let Glory understand this. I'm not helping  her find the Key. I would never do that to  an innocent-
JINX: (getting it) Än innocent?" The Key? That's an…  interesting choice of words.
BEN: No. That's not what I-
JINX: I - I understand. I'm sorry to have  bothered you. I'll take my leave-
BEN: You understand what? When I said  it's innocent… I didn't mean that the  Key is… It's not a person.
JINX: Of course not, sir. Now if you would-
BEN: You're going to run and tell her, aren't  you? Do you understand what's going  to happen if she finds the Key? How  many people are going to die? I  won't be responsible-
JINX: Please. I heard nothing-
BEN: I <u>can't</u> let that happen. Don't you see?
BEN: I can't…
WILLOW: Hey. We're heading down for  breakfast…
DAWN: I'm not hungry.
WILLOW: That's okay. It's just, we have  class after that. I don't know if  you want to go home or…
DAWN: I was going to sleep some more.  Giles said he would pick me up,  whenever.
WILLOW: Oh. Well…
WILLOW: Okay. Sure. Hang out. I have a  break around lunch time, I'll come back.
DAWN: I might not be here.
WILLOW: I'll try my luck. A noonish Dawn  break would make my day.
TARA: Take care, Dawn.
DAWN: "The Golden Age of Levitation…  War of the Warlocks… Resurrection,  A Controversy Born."
GILES: You don't have to do that, Dawn.  You're more than welcome to relax…
ANYA: Yes, sit down. We have some very  amusing chicken feet you can play with.
DAWN: That's okay.
ANYA: Don't you watch television? I -  thought all children despise effort  and enjoy cartoons.
DAWN: (simply) I like being useful. Keeps my mind  off things.
GILES: Then useful you shall be. I can  always use a hand-
ANYA: But you have a hand. A paid hand.  A hand that isn't the hand of illegal  child labor-
GILES: (cuts her off) Anya-
ANYA: -but of course it's wonderful that you  find doing my job distracting. I am  unthreatened. (to Dawn) Proceed.
GILES: Yes. Carry on, Dawn.
DAWN: Is there anything I should know?  Like… off limits stuff? Willow  told me that some of the books  and things are kind of dangerous.
GILES: Quite right. But all those items  are labeled and kept off the floor.
GILES: Our most potent texts and potions  are all up there. If somebody asks  for anything in that area - just come  and get me.
DAWN: Okay. Anything else?
GILES: If you like, I'll teach you how to work  the cash register. Then you can ring up sales.
DAWN: Cool.
ANYA: Ring sales - with the money? She gets  to fondle the money?
ANYA: (quickly) Hello customer! I'll help you - unless  you would like help from a darling little  girl who doesn't know anything.
CUSTOMER: I - excuse me?
DAWN: (to Anya) It's okay. You can take her.
GILES: Yes - go ahead, Anya. Dawn can watch  the counter while I go to the store room.
ANYA: How may I serve you?
CUSTOMER: Well… I'm looking for something nice  for a Seer's Empowerment Ceremony.  Under ten dollars.
ANYA: What an exciting request! I have  many suggestions…
GILES: I'll just be a moment.
DAWN: No problem.
GILES: Dawn-
DAWN: Uh huh?
GILES: Why don't you come watch this  transaction Anya's doing. Then  I'll let you try it.
DAWN: You got it.
SPIKE: If the spell calls for anything more  than that you're into Zombie territory  and that's bad news.
DAWN: (desperate) Spike… I wasn't-
SPIKE: I know good and well what you're  up to. That book you're holding is  infamous.
DAWN: Please. Don't tell Buffy. I just… (pained) I have to get her back. I have to.
SPIKE: I'm not going to tell, little bit.  I'm going to help.
SPIKE: I've never used this bloke's services  myself - but there's talk. Word is,  he knows everything there is to  know about resurrection spells.
SPIKE: (gently) Come on now. No worries.
DAWN: You don't have to be all nice to me. I know why you're doing this.
SPIKE: Do you now? Enlighten me.
DAWN: I'm not stupid, Spike. You're,  like, stalking my sister. You'd  do anything to get in good with her.
SPIKE: Do you want my help or not?
DAWN: I… Yeah, I just-
SPIKE: Then don't go guessing at stuff  you don't understand. And Buffy  never hears about this, okay? She  found out what I was doing, she'd drive a redwood through my chest.
DAWN: So if you don't want credit, why  are you helping?
SPIKE: Don't like to see Summers women  take it so hard on the chin, is all. (then/hard) And I'm dead serious. You breathe  a word of this to Buffy and I'll see  to it that <u>you</u> end up in the ground,  got it?
DAWN: Yeah. Got it.
SPIKE: Fine. Let's get on with it then.
GLORY: Where is he?! He should have  been back hours ago-
MURK: I'm sure Jinx is on his way, Your  New and Improvedness… He's  most loyal-
GLORY: He'd better be loyal. If any of you  even thought about taking sides with  Ben, I'd drop-kick your de-frocked  butts back into-
GLORY: Ooooh. Chocolate.
GLORY: Hhhhhmm- (abruptly) Not helping!
GLORY: Jinxy!
GLORY: No, no!
GLORY: (to minions) Mind the rug, honeys. Blood's a bitch.
GLORY: Was this the Slayer? I'll pull  her wings off, I'll-
JINX: (painfully) No… Ben-
GLORY: Ben? (outraged) <u>Ben</u>!?
GLORY: You pointless, stupid lump! Ooooh!  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
JINX: The <u>Key</u>… He told me-
GLORY: The key? What about the Key?
JINX: He indicated that it was…  a person, Most… uhhh…  Highest You.
GLORY: The Key's in human form?
JINX: (nods) I believe so… Good One.
GLORY: (thrilled) Jinx! You robed stud! You're  my man! I'm even going to let  you slide on the lame toadying,  on account of your dying and stuff…
GLORY: So the Key's all secreted away in  a flesh wrapper, huh? This narrows  the search from now on in a serious  way… I mean, we didn't have a clue.  It could have been a log, or a bicycle  pump or whatever - am I right?
GLORY: Get him fixed, would you? I want to  hear the whole story again without all  that annoying moaning.
DAWN: This place belongs to a magic guy?  It smells like grandpa.
SPIKE: (calling out) Hey! Anybody home?
DOC: Hold your horses… (sees Spike) I know you.
SPIKE: Don't think so, mate.
DOC: (confused) No, you're that guy. That guy always  hangs around down at the corner mart.  Big into dominos, aren't you?
SPIKE: Can't say that I am. Look, we came because-
DOC: That's crazy, isn't it? I'd swear you  were him. I mean, your hair's a  different color and you're a vampire,  but other than that… (then) What day is it, anyway?
DAWN: Monday.
DOC: No kidding? Would have sworn it was  Wednesday… see, that's the brain -  first thing to go. (back to Spike) Guy's name is Rocko. That's not  your name, is it?
DAWN: Maybe we should just go.
DOC: Now, now - just because the lights  are dim doesn't mean the juice is  all gone. What can I do for you?
SPIKE: (indicating Dawn) This one's mum kicked it a few  days back.
DOC: (genuine) Oh. I'm sorry.
SPIKE: We're wondering what can be done  about it. Heard you're the one to ask.
DOC: Oh, no… That's… (to Dawn) You don't want to mess with that.  I know a couple of tonics, make  the grieving fly by.
DAWN: I don't want any tonics.
DOC: (sighs heavily) Jeez. I don't know…
DAWN: (desperate) Please. I can pay you. Not all at  once, but…
SPIKE: Can you help or not, old man?  We have to act fast.
DOC: Either one of you witches? Got  experience with spells of this  magnitude?
DOC: Didn't think so.
DAWN: Ow!
DOC: Your mother's a good candidate, at  least. Strong DNA. Magic can  scramble things up real good -  you gotta have nice strong molecules  for the body to make the trip in  any kind of shape.
DAWN: Right.
DOC: Hold on.
DAWN: I've already gathered some ingredients,  but the spell I found - there's stuff I  don't understand.
DOC: It's all going to change with cloning…  Everybody'll have a double on ice.  The first you conks out? Loved-ones  just call up your replacement. Then  again, we might not make it that  long, mad cows could get us first-
DOC: But that's not now. <u>Now</u> - you've  got a Ghora demon standing between  you and success. That's the translation  you're missing.
SPIKE: Ghora… I've heard of those. They local?
DOC: Yeah, they like to stick close to the Hellmouth. (then) Egg of the Ghora gives life. It's key  to the spell. No egg, no resurrection.  Simple as that.
DAWN: Can you buy it? This egg, or…
DOC: If this was like making an omelet,  everyone would try it. No, you have  to steal the egg from the demon's nest.  And the Ghora won't be happy about it.
SPIKE: Where do we find this demon?
DOC: Hold on, Rocko. First things first. (to Dawn) You'll need an image of your mother.  A photo, painting…
DAWN: No problem.
DOC: Once you get all your ingredients  together, including the egg, mix  them up, put them in the center  of a sacred circle with that picture  of your mother and…
DOC: …say this incantation three times.  She's not going to appear - "poof!"  It takes a while. But she'll come to  you. Got it?
DAWN: Got it.
DOC: Something goes wrong, the only way  to reverse the spell is to destroy the  image of your mother, understand?
DAWN: I'm not going to change my mind.
DOC: It's a tricky spell, girl. I can't say  for sure that your mother will come  back exactly like she was. Sometimes  things get a little… off.
DAWN: But she'll still be my mother. Won't she?
DOC: More or less.
DAWN: Good. Good.
SPIKE: And the Ghora?
DOC: Right, sorry… Go in the sewer entrance  near Tracy Street. You'll see an opening  on your left. Can't miss it. Just follow that down-
DOC: No, no. Keep your money.
DAWN: Oh. Thank you-
DOC: You just keep in touch. Let me know  how it goes.
DAWN: I - I… will.
DAWN: It's here. Just like he said.
SPIKE: So at least we know the old  coot isn't completely daft. (then) Look. You'd better let me  snatch this egg thing on my own.
DAWN: No way. I'm going.
SPIKE: No. You're not. I've got no idea  what's down there. I deliver you  back to your sister in pieces, that'd  be the end of me - wouldn't it?
DAWN: You need me, Spike. Someone's  got to get the egg while you  distract the Ghora.
SPIKE: I'll manage.
DAWN: How? You said yourself you're not  even sure what you're dealing with.  Now come on.
SPIKE: Well, look at that - bitty Buffy.
DAWN: (scared) Doesn't look so bad.
SPIKE: Wait 'til it wakes up. That's usually  when the bad starts.
DAWN: I can't get to the eggs unless it moves.  No way.
SPIKE: I'll make it move. You just be ready.
SPIKE: (to Ghora) Hey! Ghora! Heads up!
SPIKE: Right then. Heads it is.
DAWN: Spike! Come on!
SPIKE: Leave it, Dawn. Troika there  knows what we're after-
DAWN: I can't. Mom-
SPIKE: It's too dangerous, and I don't have-
SPIKE: -a weapon.
DAWN: Spike!
DAWN: Sorry.
SPIKE: (pained) Did you get it?
SPIKE: Don't be sorry then.
DAWN: Osiris, giver of darkness, taker of  life, God of Gods - accept my  offering… Bone, flesh, breath -  yours, eternally.
DAWN: I beg of you - return to me.
WILLOW: What did I have for breakfast  this morning? Do you remember?
TARA: Hum?
WILLOW: I want to say bagel but I think  that was yesterday. You had  eggs, sunny side up. I remember  because they were wiggling at  me like little boobs…
TARA: (smiles) Sassy eggs. (then) What are you writing this for?
WILLOW: My journal.
TARA: (re: journal) That's new.
WILLOW: Yeah, I figured, you know…  Life goes by fast. If you don't  write it down, a lot of it just  gets… lost. And I want to  remember.
TARA: (affectionately) Down to every last bagel.
WILLOW: Down to every last everything  I do with you.
TARA: Huh.
WILLOW: What?
TARA: What happened to "History of  Witchcraft?"
WILLOW: I - it isn't there?
TARA: Dawn must have taken it.
WILLOW: What? No, she didn't. She did?
TARA: That book has a whole section  on resurrection spells. (worried) This is bad. This is really bad…
WILLOW: But it's just a history book. It  might answer some of her  questions - but it's not like she  could do any harm with that  stuff. Could she?
TARA: It doesn't have a "how to" guide,  but it refers to specific resurrection  spells and potions.
WILLOW: I didn't- I mean, hey! How'd  she know that?
TARA: I don't know. But she could get  into major trouble with that information.  (looking around) God. What else did she take-
WILLOW: (too quickly) Nothing.
WILLOW: I think. I <u>think</u> she took nothing else  but maybe she did and we should look,  because who knows? I don't.
TARA: No. We can't waste time on that now.  Who knows what she's up to…
WILLOW: We need to call Buffy. Now.
BUFFY: Hello? Hey Tara. Yeah, I just got in-
DAWN: …Bone, flesh, breath - yours,  eternally. Bone, flesh, breath -  I beg of you - return to me.
BUFFY: <u>Dawn</u>-
BUFFY: What have you done?
BUFFY: <u>What have you done</u>?!
DAWN: She's coming. She's coming home.
BUFFY: You have no idea what you're  messing with! Who knows what  you actually raised - what's  going to come through that door-
DAWN: I know. It'll be her-
BUFFY: No. Tara told me these spells go  bad all the time. People come back <u>wrong</u>-
DAWN: She won't. He told me. Her DNA-
BUFFY: Who told you? Who helped you?!
DAWN: Nobody! Now let me go-
BUFFY: You have to stop it, reverse it-
DAWN: No!
BUFFY: <u>Dawn</u>. You <u>know</u> this is wrong.  You know you can't let this happen.  Not to Mom.
DAWN: But I need her. I don't care if she's…  I'm not like you, Buffy, I don't have  anybody-
BUFFY: (shocked) What? Of course you do. You have me-
DAWN: I don't! You won't even look at me!  It's so obvious you don't want me  around-
BUFFY: That's - that's not true-
DAWN: It is! And the way you've been acting!  Mom <u>died</u> and it's like you don't even care!
BUFFY: God - of course I care. Of course I do.  How can you think that?
DAWN: How can I not? You haven't even cried!  You've just been running around like it's  all been some big chore - cleaning up  after mom's mess-
BUFFY: I've been working - I've been busy,  because I have to… be…
DAWN: You don't. You're avoiding me-
BUFFY: I'm <u>not</u>. I have to do these things,  'cause… 'cause when I stop, then  she's really… gone. And I'm trying,  really trying to take care of things…  But I don't even know what I'm doing…  Mom, she always knew-
DAWN: Nobody's asking you to be Mom.
BUFFY: Well, who's going to be if I'm not?  Huh, Dawn? Have you thought  about that? Who's going to make  things better? Who's going to take  care of us?
DAWN: Buffy-
BUFFY: I didn't mean to push you away…  I didn't… I just didn't want you to  see me… I mean… Oh, God…  What are we going to do, Dawny?  I'm so scared-
BUFFY: Mommy?
DAWN: Buffy…
BUFFY: Mom!
BUFFY: Dawn-
DAWN: It's okay…
