It's not that. It's just - what if mom… What if she'd like something else better?
I mean, how do we know? For sure? She's the one who has to be in it forever.
It's fine. It's just-
What color flowers?
She said that? When?
She never said anything to me.
I'm not feeling very casserole-y.
That's okay. I'm not really hungry.
Why should I? You're not.
We should try his girlfriend's place-
But we could ask one of his friends at  work or something.
What are we going to do - after? I mean, we're not just coming back  here are we?
I don't want to come back here.
(to Willow) Maybe I could go to your place tomorrow?
Yeah. After everything? I don't want to come back to the house and stuff. I don't want to be here.
(to Buffy) Can I?
Can I go to Willow's tomorrow after the service?
I'll get my sleeping bag out of the attic.
It's for mom.
No. Thanks.
You don't know that.
(a little angry) So - what? Life just goes on and I  forget mom? Is that what you're saying?
No.
I don't want to sleep.
Good, because I know. What I  want to do now.
Well, you're witches… And  you do magic and stuff…
I want to do a spell. (beat) I want to bring Mom back.
Why? You guys do magic for all  kinds of things.
All you do is mess with the natural  order of things! You make things  float and disappear and, and-
You don't! They put her in the <u>ground</u>-
So it is possible then. To bring someone  back. They wouldn't have taken an oath  if they didn't know they could do it-
(to Willow) You said you wanted to help me.
<u>Don't</u>.
I'm not hungry.
I was going to sleep some more.  Giles said he would pick me up,  whenever.
I might not be here.
"The Golden Age of Levitation…  War of the Warlocks… Resurrection,  A Controversy Born."
That's okay.
(simply) I like being useful. Keeps my mind  off things.
Is there anything I should know?  Like… off limits stuff? Willow  told me that some of the books  and things are kind of dangerous.
Okay. Anything else?
Cool.
(to Anya) It's okay. You can take her.
No problem.
Uh huh?
You got it.
(desperate) Spike… I wasn't-
Please. Don't tell Buffy. I just… (pained) I have to get her back. I have to.
You don't have to be all nice to me. I know why you're doing this.
I'm not stupid, Spike. You're,  like, stalking my sister. You'd  do anything to get in good with her.
I… Yeah, I just-
So if you don't want credit, why  are you helping?
Yeah. Got it.
This place belongs to a magic guy?  It smells like grandpa.
Monday.
Maybe we should just go.
I don't want any tonics.
(desperate) Please. I can pay you. Not all at  once, but…
Ow!
Right.
I've already gathered some ingredients,  but the spell I found - there's stuff I  don't understand.
Can you buy it? This egg, or…
No problem.
Got it.
I'm not going to change my mind.
But she'll still be my mother. Won't she?
Good. Good.
Oh. Thank you-
I - I… will.
It's here. Just like he said.
No way. I'm going.
You need me, Spike. Someone's  got to get the egg while you  distract the Ghora.
How? You said yourself you're not  even sure what you're dealing with.  Now come on.
(scared) Doesn't look so bad.
I can't get to the eggs unless it moves.  No way.
Spike! Come on!
I can't. Mom-
Spike!
Sorry.
Osiris, giver of darkness, taker of  life, God of Gods - accept my  offering… Bone, flesh, breath -  yours, eternally.
I beg of you - return to me.
…Bone, flesh, breath - yours,  eternally. Bone, flesh, breath -  I beg of you - return to me.
She's coming. She's coming home.
I know. It'll be her-
She won't. He told me. Her DNA-
Nobody! Now let me go-
No!
But I need her. I don't care if she's…  I'm not like you, Buffy, I don't have  anybody-
I don't! You won't even look at me!  It's so obvious you don't want me  around-
It is! And the way you've been acting!  Mom <u>died</u> and it's like you don't even care!
How can I not? You haven't even cried!  You've just been running around like it's  all been some big chore - cleaning up  after mom's mess-
You don't. You're avoiding me-
Nobody's asking you to be Mom.
Buffy-
Buffy…
It's okay…
