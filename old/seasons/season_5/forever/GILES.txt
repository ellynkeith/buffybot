Buffy. There you are…
Are you alright?
(to Buffy) I checked prices with a few  different florists. The funeral  home is competitive.
We could put a line in the program.  Expressing your mother's preference  not to have one.
Of course.
Hello? Yes… They did. Thank you…  The service is tomorrow at three. Do  you know the Brown Brothers Mortuary?…
You don't have to do that, Dawn.  You're more than welcome to relax…
Then useful you shall be. I can  always use a hand-
(cuts her off) Anya-
Yes. Carry on, Dawn.
Quite right. But all those items  are labeled and kept off the floor.
Our most potent texts and potions  are all up there. If somebody asks  for anything in that area - just come  and get me.
If you like, I'll teach you how to work  the cash register. Then you can ring up sales.
Yes - go ahead, Anya. Dawn can watch  the counter while I go to the store room.
I'll just be a moment.
Dawn-
Why don't you come watch this  transaction Anya's doing. Then  I'll let you try it.
