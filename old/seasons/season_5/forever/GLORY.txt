He'd better be loyal. If any of you  even thought about taking sides with  Ben, I'd drop-kick your de-frocked  butts back into-
Ooooh. Chocolate.
Hhhhhmm- (abruptly) Not helping!
Jinxy!
No, no!
(to minions) Mind the rug, honeys. Blood's a bitch.
Was this the Slayer? I'll pull  her wings off, I'll-
Ben? (outraged) <u>Ben</u>!?
You pointless, stupid lump! Ooooh!  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
The key? What about the Key?
The Key's in human form?
(thrilled) Jinx! You robed stud! You're  my man! I'm even going to let  you slide on the lame toadying,  on account of your dying and stuff…
So the Key's all secreted away in  a flesh wrapper, huh? This narrows  the search from now on in a serious  way… I mean, we didn't have a clue.  It could have been a log, or a bicycle  pump or whatever - am I right?
Get him fixed, would you? I want to  hear the whole story again without all  that annoying moaning.
