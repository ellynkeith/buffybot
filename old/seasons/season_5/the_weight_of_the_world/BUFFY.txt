Do you like dolls?
I like it here.
Why?
It's a big day for me.
Who's afraid?
No, I wanna be the baby.
You're gonna pay more attention  to her and forget all about me. (to Willow) Doesn't she look funny? Like a wrinkly  old grandpa.
I ... I could be the one to look after  her sometimes, if you need a helper.  Mom? Can I take care of her?
Death is my gift?
Don't be, Will. Death is my gift.
(shrugs) It's really not that complicated.
It's just what I do.
What?
Hi, Willow. What are you doing here?
Do you like dolls?
(giggles) You talk funny.
(shrugs) Don't you like it here?
Mommy! Daddy!
I... I could be the one to look after her  sometimes, if you need a helper.  Mom? Can I take care of her?
Doing what?
Why?
Will, I did this.
I don't know what you're talking about. Excuse me?
My gift. This is what I do.
Don't go there, Will.
Do I?
This was when I quit, Will.
(nods) Just for a second.
I remember I was in the magic shop.  Reading.
I put a book back for Giles.
Nothing special about it. And then,  it hit me.
I can't beat Glory.
Glory's going to win.
I didn't just know it.
I felt it. Glory will beat me.
And in that second of knowing it, Will ...
I wanted it to happen.
I wanted it over. This is all - all of it -  it's too much for me.
I just wanted it over.
If Glory wins, then Dawn dies.
I would grieve and people would feel  sorry for me. But it would all be over.  And I imagined what a relief that would be.
My thinking it made it happen. Some  part of me wanted it. So, in the  moment Glory took Dawn ...
I know I could have done something  better. And I didn't. I was off by some  fraction of a second.
And this is why.
I killed my sister.
I got Dawn killed ...
I don't think I can.
And what if I can't?
Wait. Where are you going?
Hear you found the ritual text.
So I'm told. (to Giles) What do we know?
Might help if you actually said it.
Dawn's blood?
So how do we stop it?
