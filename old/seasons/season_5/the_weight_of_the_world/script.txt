MURK: Quickly, quickly!
GRONX: Why do we remain when our moment of triumph lies so close at hand?
MURK: The Glorious One, having acquired  much in this world, does not exactly  travel light.
GLORY: Hey! Minions. I can <i>hear</i> you.  God-like ears - don't miss much,  know what I'm saying?
GRONX: 'Twas he who blasphemed, your magnificence.
MURK: Spurred on by treacherous urging!
GLORY: Guys - I'm not gonna kill you. Not in the mood. (beat) What do you think that's about?
GRONX: In mercy does your power lie.
GLORY: No, brainless. In torture, death and chaos does my power lie. So tell me. Why am I not popping your head like a zit right now?
MURK: Yes! We shall fetch a ...
GLORY: Nah, I'm not hungry.
GRONX: The portal shall open.
MURK: And the Great Glorificus shall return.
GLORY: To the Hell I came from. Where I'm  gonna rain down more supersized  portions of slaughter, mayhem, and  bloodshed than you scabs can even  dream about.
SPIKE: Better part of a century spent in delinquency just paid off. (beat) Hot-wired Ben's auto. Who's for getting the hell out of here?
XANDER: All in favor, let's do it. (to Giles) You good to go?
GILES: Never mind about me. How's Buffy?
XANDER: Same. Still.
WILLOW: It's been almost half an hour.
SPIKE: The Slayer'll be all right. Won't she?
XANDER: Try again, Will.
WILLOW: Okay, but I'm not sure if she's, you know, really in there.
XANDER: Try.
WILLOW: Buffy? Can you hear me? Buffy?
SPIKE: Buffy! She can't just be brain dead.  I mean - she's still Buffy. Somewhere,  in there. Right?
XANDER: Spike, come on. We're not getting Dawn back by sitting around here.
SPIKE: You're not getting Dawn back any  way you slice it, Harris. That's for  Buffy to handle.
XANDER: Good. Panic. That ought to help.
ANYA: It's like she's in some kind of fugue state.
WILLOW: We should move her. Unless we shouldn't. Should we?
ANYA: Couldn't that make it worse? I think I read that somewhere ...
XANDER: I am so large with not knowing.
GILES: Impossible to know for sure. Losing  Dawn, after all Buffy's been through -  I think it's pushed her too far, into  some kind of catatonia.
SPIKE: You don't need a diploma to see that. Snap her out of it. Buffy?
ANYA: Spike!
SPIKE: Come on, people, the girl's endowed  with Slayer strength. Hardly the time  to get dainty. BUFFY!
XANDER: We tried that.
ANYA: We didn't try that.
XANDER: Are you insane!? We could be  dealing with neurological damage  here. You want to kill her?
SPIKE: We've got to do something! I can't  just sit here watching. You waste  time with kid gloves. I'm willing to  gamble when all's said and done -  Buffy likes it rough.
XANDER: I said stop!
SPIKE: Do that again, I'll have a piece of you.
WILLOW: <i>Separate</i>.
ANYA: W-what will you do?
WILLOW: I'll help Buffy.
ANYA: Okay, then.
TARA: The world is spinning. Straight, to  the new day. Big day, big big day ...
SPIKE: Uh, Will? Now, uh, don't turn me  into a horned toad for asking, but -  what if we come across Ben?
WILLOW: Nothing, I don't think a doctor's what Buffy needs right now.
SPIKE: Well, yeah. Specially not one who also happens to be Glory.
GILES: What do you mean?
SPIKE: <u>You</u> know... Ben is Glory.
WILLOW: You mean Ben's with Glory?
XANDER: "With" in what sense?
ANYA: They're working together?
SPIKE: No no. Ben is Glory. Glory's Ben. They're one and the same.
ANYA: When did all this happen?
SPIKE: Not one hour ago! Right here, before  your very eyes! Ben came, turned into  Glory, snatched the kid, and - phht! -  vanished. Remember?
XANDER: (deliberate) So you're saying... Ben, and Glory ...
ANYA: Have a... <i>connection</i>.
GILES: Yes, obviously. But what kind?
SPIKE: Ah! I get it. <i>Very</i> crafty. Glory's  worked the kind of mojo where  anyone who sees her little presto- chango instantly forgets. And yours  truly, being somewhat other than  human, stands immune.
WILLOW: So, Ben and Glory are... the same person?
XANDER: Glory can turn into Ben, and Ben turns back into Glory.
ANYA: And anyone who sees it instantly forgets.
SPIKE: And a kewpie doll for the lady.
GILES: Excellent. Now. Do we suspect  there could be any kind of link  between Ben and Glory?
SPIKE: (sighing) Might be best, I explain on the way ...
GLORY: Unbelievable, how annoying the Groupies can be.
MURK: They merely sense that tonight at  last the Dimensional Portal shall open ...
GRONX: Ushering in the long and bloody reign of the great ...
GLORY: What's he doing?
PRIEST: I must anoint the Key.
GLORY: Really don't. Go.
PRIEST: But...
GLORY: Get out get out GET OUT!!!
MURK: We'll just, uh... give you two a little space.
GLORY: Tch. You know, you recapture  your Godhood and unleash Armageddon?  All of a sudden everybody wants to  be part of the inner circle. You okay?
DAWN: I want to go home.
GLORY: Sweetie, you're about to.
DAWN: No.
GLORY: Pillow? I don't know if this thing  gets cable. Doubtful...
DAWN: Please. Stop.
GLORY: You're nervous.
DAWN: Yes.
GLORY: I know how you feel. It's your  last night. As, you know, a human.  This body?
DAWN: Don't.
GLORY: (confused) What?
DAWN: Don't - call - me - "Dawnie."
GLORY: (genuine, child-like) Wow. You know ... that actually hurt my feelings.
DAWN: I'm sorry.
GLORY: Not the point. (piecing it together) I'm just thinking, here I'm trying  to make you feel better when: comforting others - not part of my  life. And I'm doing it so that I'll  stop feeling so, um ... help me out.
DAWN: Guilty?
GLORY: Guilty!
DAWN: I'm not doing anything, I swear.
GLORY: We'll see.
WILLOW: I think so. I don't know. It's not  exactly well-explored territory, but ...  I've got to try.
ANYA: Spells like this ... It could be dangerous  for Buffy. And you.
TARA: Time. Time is coming. Time ...
WILLOW: Shh, it's okay. I'm here. (to Anya) Will you watch after her while I'm ...
ANYA: Sure. What do I do?
WILLOW: Mostly? Just be here for her. There's  some pills in my knapsack. Half of  one every two hours keeps her pretty  mellow.
ANYA: Think you'll be gone more than two hours?
WILLOW: (shrugs) Wish me luck.
ANYA: Okay. (awkward, too enthusiastic) Good Luck.
ANYA: (softly) Good luck.
ANYA: Do you like tea? I'm told it's soothing.  Do you need something soothing?  How about some TV?
TARA: Aaahh!!
ANYA: Bunnies. (shudders, then:) Back to tea.
WILLOW: Hello, Buffy.
WILLOW: Actually, I'm, um - looking for you.
BUFFY: Do you like dolls?
WILLOW: Buffy, what are you doing here?
BUFFY: I like it here.
WILLOW: But, you know we need you. You have to come out.
BUFFY: Why?
WILLOW: To be with your friends.
BUFFY: It's a big day for me.
JOYCE: Hi, Buffy.
HANK: How's my girl?
JOYCE: Ready to meet your new baby sister?
HANK: Oh c'mon now, Buffy... she's nothing to be afraid of.
BUFFY: Who's afraid?
JOYCE: Don't you want to be the big sister?
BUFFY: No, I wanna be the baby.
HANK: Buffy...
BUFFY: You're gonna pay more attention  to her and forget all about me. (to Willow) Doesn't she look funny? Like a wrinkly  old grandpa.
JOYCE: Here. Like this. Support the head. There you go. We're calling her "Dawn."
WILLOW: (to herself) Dawn ...
BUFFY: I ... I could be the one to look after  her sometimes, if you need a helper.  Mom? Can I take care of her?
JOYCE: Yes, Buffy. You can take care of her.
WILLOW: O-kayâ€¦
XANDER: How you doing?
GILES: Only hurts when I answer pointless questions. Where's Buffy?
XANDER: Willow's on it. Or, in it. She's  working some spell, trying to reach  Buffy psychically.
GILES: She's gone into Buffy's mind?
XANDER: Pretty trippy stuff.
GILES: It's extraordinarily advanced. (shakes it off) I'm thinking we might check on Glory's victims while we're here.
XANDER: The mental ward? Already been.  Vegetable section's closed. Nobody  there. It's like they all just got up  and walked away.
SPIKE: Checked out Glory's flat - looks like the Great One has scampered.
GILES: Gone to perform her ritual with Dawn.  And leaving us entirely clueless.
SPIKE: Not entirely.
XANDER: Wait - Ben? At Glory's? So you're  saying that all this time he was  sub-letting from her?
SPIKE: This - is gonna be worth it.
SPIKE: Ow!
SPIKE: Ow!
XANDER: Ow!
SPIKE: Last time, from the top ...
GLORY: I'm hating this, Murk.
GRONX: And "this" would be what exactly, your holiness?
GLORY: Memories. I'm starting to remember  the things Ben did. People he spoke  with, stuff he wore... (shudders) Kid.
DAWN: Ben?
GLORY: Yeah. Ben. You... (remembering) You called him. To the desert, when  you were hiding from me. And he  came. And then, he was me. You  remember?
DAWN: Yes.
GLORY: See?!? She's not supposed to remember  that! <i>Nobody</i> should. The cloak between  Ben and me is fading. I almost helped her!  He, I wanted to ...
PRIEST: What?
GLORY: Ben! The human meatsack who's  infecting me. Do your mojo, make a surgical ... (hunts for the word)  Incision or removal or whatever it is  you gotta do! Help me! I'm thinking  Ben's thoughts and feeling his feelings  and - IIII...
BEN: ... Can't kill the girl...!
GLORY: Damn it!
PRIEST: This I cannot do. You risk terrible  Magicks in opening the Portal.  Nothing comes without a price.  This is yours.
GLORY: Gods don't pay.
WILLOW: Hey. I know you. You're that first  original Slayer who tried killing us  all in our dreams. (lame) How've you been?
PRIMITIVE: (to Buffy) Death is your gift.
BUFFY: Death is my gift?
WILLOW: Wait. Death is her what?
PRIMITIVE: Death is your gift.
WILLOW: Where you going?
MURK: Glorificus! Wait! Kill the Key now, all will be lost!
GRONX: You will be stuck on this mortal plane forever.
GLORY: All right, you're right, it's cool. I'm  just a little emotional right now.  Which, if you're into irony: funny. (to Minions) Leave. We need a little girl time.
DAWN: (suspicious) Do what?
GLORY: (duh) People. How do they function? Here.  Like this, in the world, with all this  <i>bile</i> running through them. Every day, it's ...
DAWN: It depends on the person.
GLORY: So, you're saying some people like this?
DAWN: Some.
GLORY: Funny, 'cause I look around at this  world you're so eager to be a part of,  and all I see's six billion lunatics  looking for the fastest ride out.  Who's not crazy? Look around -  everyone's drinkin', smokin', shootin' up, shootin' each other or just plain  screwing their brains out because they  don't want 'em anymore. I'm crazy?  Honey, I am the original one-eyed  chicklet in the kingdom of the blind  'cause at least I admit the world makes  me nuts. Name one person who can  take it here. That's all I'm asking - Name one.
DAWN: Buffy.
WILLOW: I can't keep following you around like  this, Buffy. We have to go. You have  to talk to ...
WILLOW: ... Me.
BUFFY: Don't be, Will. Death is my gift.
WILLOW: Yeah, I keep hearing that, but I'm not sure what it means.
BUFFY: (shrugs) It's really not that complicated.
WILLOW: Not to you, maybe ...
BUFFY: It's just what I do.
WILLOW: Buffy, stop. No, God, no. Stop!
BUFFY: What?
GLORY: Ohh, Ben! This is really - not a  good time... nNNNOO!!
BEN: Dawn. Has Glory hurt you?
DAWN: No. Not yet. But I have to get out of here. Ben?
BEN: Where is it?
DAWN: Where's what?
BEN: All the blood. I can feel it, still warm  and wet and... Glory. Oh, God.  She slaughtered hundreds of men.  I can feel them breaking.
DAWN: Ben. Something is happening. To both you <i>and</i> Glory.
BEN: (calming down) I'm remembering her, aren't I? The things she's done. Things she's going to do.
DAWN: I know. She told me. I think whatever  the magic is that keeps you guys apart,  it's starting to break down. Ben.  Glory could come back any minute.
BEN: How can she do this?
DAWN: I don't know. But we have to get out  of here and find Buffy before ...
BEN: No, I mean, I have a job. I have a life.  And Glory? She never once thinks of  me in all this.
DAWN: Help me.
BEN: How?
DAWN: Please.
PRIEST: You're not ...
BEN: I'll take you as far as I can. Ditch you before she comes back.
BUFFY: Hi, Willow. What are you doing here?
WILLOW: Actually, I'm, um - looking for you.  Here. Again.
BUFFY: Do you like dolls?
WILLOW: No. And I think we already deja'd this vu.
BUFFY: (giggles) You talk funny.
WILLOW: Yes, as you'll tell me again when we're  older, and in chem class. Buffy, what  are we doing here?
BUFFY: (shrugs) Don't you like it here?
WILLOW: We don't have time.
BUFFY: Mommy! Daddy!
HANK: We're home.
JOYCE: We're calling her "Dawn."
BUFFY: I... I could be the one to look after her  sometimes, if you need a helper.  Mom? Can I take care of her?
JOYCE: Yes, Buffy. You can take care of her.
DOC: It's always open.
SPIKE: Thanks awfully, no. We need information. We need ...
XANDER: (blurts) Ben is Glory!
DOC: Who's what?
SPIKE: (to Xander) Look at this. Special Ed remembers.
XANDER: Yeah. I do. Ben's Glory. Glory, Ben. It's like a fog is lifting.
SPIKE: Wonderful. But not why we're here. (to Doc) Hellgod type, name of Glory ...
XANDER: A.K.A. <i>Ben</i> ...
SPIKE: ... is gone missing. Brewing up some  major league bad. And she's nicked  the Slayer's kid sister in the bargain.
DOC: That girl you brought here? Sweet little  thing -- how'd it work out with her mom?  Changed her mind, didn't she?
SPIKE: Yeah, yeah. Got any idea where Glory would take her?
DOC: Glory? Glory... ooh, you don't mean  Glorificus? Gosh, what do you want  to get mixed up with her for? That's  a sure way to get yourselves killed.  I hear she's awfully unpleasant.
SPIKE: Love to. Can't.
DOC: Well, other than that ...
SPIKE: She's got Dawn.
DOC: Right. Well... I may know a fella, who  knows a fella - in China. Big cheese of  his own ancient holy order, he might ...
SPIKE: How the hell we supposed to get to China? Teleport?
DOC: I guess, if you're in that much of a rush.  Wish you luck. You and your specially  challenged friend. I might, maybe have  a phone number handy, let's see now ...
SPIKE: You're lying.
DOC: Idiot.
SPIKE: Aaahh!!
XANDER: (re: box) What do we got?
SPIKE: Something worth dying for.
WILLOW: You have to stop doing this.
BUFFY: Doing what?
WILLOW: Killing Dawn.
BUFFY: Why?
WILLOW: Because it never happened. You never killed your sister!
BUFFY: Will, I did this.
WILLOW: In your imagination! None of this is  real, you're stuck in some kind of loop.
BUFFY: I don't know what you're talking about. Excuse me?
WILLOW: Why are you doing this?!?
BEN: Don't look back. Stay close to me.
BEN: Shh. Stay very still.
DAWN: I'm sorry.
GLORY: "Sorry?" That actually hurt, you pre-pubescent puke.
GLORY: Okay, first thought, just totally  spontaneous, unfiltered, off the top of my head?
BEN: I said leave her alone!
GLORY: No. NO! Little late in the game to  start growing a backbone, Benjamin.  Now be good and stay quiet.
BEN: Do you ever stop talking? I don't know  which is worse, waking up in a dress  not knowing where I've been, or  having to hear all your self-involved ranting.
GLORY: Animal...
BEN: Wrong, Glory. I'm no animal. This  is humanity you're feeling. Welcome  to the world.
GLORY: No no no.
BEN: I won't let you hurt her, Glory.
GLORY: Shut your hole, you sanctimonious little  meatworm. I'm going home no matter  what you do.
BEN: You really think I'll just let that happen?
GLORY: Benjamin. What are you doing?
BEN: You need her blood?
GLORY: You can't hurt her and you know it,  Ben. I know it, because I feel what  you're feeling. Scared?
BEN: You can't. You're immortal.
GLORY: Nobody has to die here, Ben. Just  let me bleed the girl and go home.  Everything'll work out fine.
BEN: Do you really believe, with all I know, that you can trick me?
GLORY: Stop and think, baby. We bleed the  kid. Return me to my seat of power.  I become a God again.
BEN: And I disappear.
GLORY: Unless somebody up there likes you.  Give up the girl, and I could like you a lot.
BEN: I won't make a deal with you, Glory.
GLORY: (sighs) When exactly did you get stupid? I'm offering immortality here!
BEN: I believe you. That's not the problem.  You make me immortal, then what? (grabbing Dawn) I have to kill her to do it and I won't  be able live with that! Not even for a  day - forget about eternity.
GLORY: Baby, baby, baby Ben... why do you  worry so much? When you're immortal,  all this crap you've been carrying around  inside - the guilt, the anger, the crazy-making  pain ... it all just melts away, like ice  cream. Trust me. When all this is over,  I can set you up real nice. I'm making  it easy. It's you - or the girl.
BEN: I can't accept that.
GLORY: Accept it. (smiles) I'm a God, stupid.
BEN: I'm sorry.
DAWN: Wh-what are you doing?
BEN: Don't make this harder than it already is.  I'm sorry, I got no choice. It's you or me.
WILLOW: No. Buffy. Leave Dawn alone. What is this?
BUFFY: My gift. This is what I do.
WILLOW: But I'm not talking about this, I'm talking about ...
WILLOW: ... This.
BUFFY: Don't go there, Will.
WILLOW: I'm not! You're the one who keeps  dragging me back here. And you  wouldn't be doing that if you weren't  trying to show me something.
BUFFY: Do I?
WILLOW: Buffy, c'mon. It's your brain. Just tell me.
BUFFY: This was when I quit, Will.
WILLOW: You did?
BUFFY: (nods) Just for a second.
BUFFY: I remember I was in the magic shop.  Reading.
BUFFY: I put a book back for Giles.
BUFFY: Nothing special about it. And then,  it hit me.
WILLOW: What hit you?
BUFFY: I can't beat Glory.
BUFFY: Glory's going to win.
WILLOW: You can't know that.
BUFFY: I didn't just know it.
BUFFY: I felt it. Glory will beat me.
BUFFY: And in that second of knowing it, Will ...
BUFFY: I wanted it to happen.
WILLOW: Why?
BUFFY: I wanted it over. This is all - all of it -  it's too much for me.
BUFFY: I just wanted it over.
BUFFY: If Glory wins, then Dawn dies.
BUFFY: I would grieve and people would feel  sorry for me. But it would all be over.  And I imagined what a relief that would be.
WILLOW: Is that what you think?
BUFFY: My thinking it made it happen. Some  part of me wanted it. So, in the  moment Glory took Dawn ...
BUFFY: I know I could have done something  better. And I didn't. I was off by some  fraction of a second.
BUFFY: And this is why.
BUFFY: I killed my sister.
WILLOW: I think Spike was right, back at the gas station. (sudden, sharp) Snap out of it!
BUFFYS: What?
WILLOW: I'm sorry. But all this - it has a name.  It's called guilt. It's a feeling, and it's  important, but it's not more than that,  Buffy. <i>Buffys</i>. You've carried the  weight of the world on your shoulders  since high school. I know you didn't  ask for this. But you do it. Every day,  and so you wanted out for one second,  so what?
BUFFY: I got Dawn killed ...
WILLOW: Hello! Your sister - not dead yet!  But she will be if you stay locked  inside here and never come back to us.
BUFFY: I don't think I can.
WILLOW: Okay, unlike Glory, the Slayer is also  human. You get to be. You feel  everything you're doing and I admit,  I have no idea how hard that must be -  but you have to do it.
BUFFY: And what if I can't?
WILLOW: Then I guess you're right. And you did kill your sister.
BUFFY: Wait. Where are you going?
WILLOW: Where you're needed.
GILES: You're back.
BUFFY: Hear you found the ritual text.
GILES: Something like that, yes.
XANDER: Did you know Ben is Glory?
BUFFY: So I'm told. (to Giles) What do we know?
GILES: Well, according to these scrolls, there is a way to stop Glory.
BUFFY: Might help if you actually said it.
GILES: Glory plans to open a dimensional portal  by way of ritual bloodletting.
BUFFY: Dawn's blood?
GILES: Yes. Once the blood is shed at a  certain time and place, the fabric  separating all realities will be ripped  apart. Dimensions will pour into one  another with no barriers to stop them.  Reality as we know it will be destroyed,  and chaos will reign on Earth.
BUFFY: So how do we stop it?
GILES: The portal will only close once the  blood is stopped. And the only way  for that to happen is ...
