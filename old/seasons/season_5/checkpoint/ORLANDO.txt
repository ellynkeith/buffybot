Go on, Slayer - kill me. But know that my death will only buy you more time.
One soldier in a vast army.
The Knights of Byzantium.  An ancient order. And now, your enemy.
You think we ally ourselves with the Beast? You must be mad.
We were fools. (small laugh) Three alone. But if it takes a hundred men, we send the hundred. And if it takes a thousand, we send them too. So long as you protect the Key, our brotherhood will never stop until we destroy it. And you.
You are the Slayer. We know what we must do. Now be done with it. Kill us, and let Legions follow.
