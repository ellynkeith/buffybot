Don't touch me, you're crusty. What do you want?
The Slayer? I don't know any Slayer. Get away from me. You shouldn't be here.
Buffy Summers is the Slayer?
I knew she was strong - the Slayer. I didn't think a Slayer would be so- How does Glory know this?
Why? So Glory can find her? Do something to her? Why would I do that?
Well, I've got a message for Glory too.
