(under her breath) I didn't create the troll... I didn't date the troll... (starting to have fun) In fact I hate the troll. I helped deflate the troll- (off Xander's look) All done.
Maybe they won't be so bad this time. I mean, Buffy, they did think you were Faith last time. Now that they know  you're just you... maybe they won't care enough to kill you.
Does it matter? I mean is she really gonna set the Junior High buzzing with "There's a delegation a-comin'?"
Questions. Great.
We're... friends.
Girlfriends, actually.
(stronger) We're in love. Lovers. We're gay lesbian-type lovers.

Not that she's like, a weird loner or anything.

If it works, much easier slaying for Buffy. Not that it's hard for her now-
Oh, a high level. Very high. One of those... top... levels.
(mouthed to Tara) Five?
Yes! Yes, of course we're r... r...
Fascists.
(to Xander, softly) That's Riley-speak.
