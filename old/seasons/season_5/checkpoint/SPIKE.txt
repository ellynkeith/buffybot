Not for money, if that's what you think. Your heartfelt gratitude is plenty. 'Spect I'll be getting that any moment now.
Getting in your way? I saved you!
You were about to be regrouped into separate piles. You needed help.
Oh, I get it. You just don't like who did the rescuing, that's all. Wishin' I was your boyfriend what's-his-height. Oh wait, he's run off.
Don't need? Or can't keep? You keep making notches on the headboard, but eventually they get out of bed and run away, don't they?
Rough talk. Maybe that's what your problem is, you push 'em away? Or is it the other - maybe you cling too much? Or p'rhaps it's even simpler. Check your breath lately? Or maybe the beauty's fading. The stress of Slaying aging you prematurely. Things not like they used to be... not as high, not as firm.
...Or maybe you just don't hold their interest.
That's right.
If I'm not, I'm gonna be pissed about drinking all that blood.
My goodness, you put that together all on your own? That's right. Leastways that's what I've got 'em all believing.
Could just be a hoax, though. I fake some headaches, everyone gets used to poor helpless Spike. Then one day, no warning, I snap a spine, bend a head back, drain 'em dry. Brilliant.
Desire? Yeah, I've got tons of that.
I pitch in when she pays me.
Money, little nip of blood out of some stray victim, whatever.
Sure, if they're gonna die anyway. Come to think of it though, that is a bit scandalous, innit? Personally, I'm shocked. The girl's slipping.
Oh yeah. See, the poor little twig can't keep a man. Gets her all down. A few more disappointments, she'll be crying on my shoulder, mark my words.
Heard of me, have you?
Well, well. Isn't that neat.
Tell me, pet, now we're such good friends... how's the Slayer doing? She okay? High marks in all categories?
Aah! (then, relaxing) Oh, it's the Slayer. For a second there I was worried.
So, what can I do you for?
Great! I need your cash.
Well, that's a boatload of manly responsibility to come flying out of nowhere. What's the matter, Slayer? Not feeling a hundred percent?
They didn't put a chip in your head, did they?
Be funny if they did.
What's in it for me? Mind, I've seen what your gratitude's like. I still prefer the Benjamins.
Hmm. Guess not. All right then. (to Joyce &amp; Dawn) Ladies. Come on in. Plenty of blood in the fridge, don't be shy.
What do you think?
Yeah, yeah... "anything happens to them, I'll stake you good and proper." Sing me a new one sometime, eh? That bit's gone stale.
Just don't break anything and don't make a lot of noise - "Passions" is coming on.
No, no - she can just sew him back together. He's a doll, for God's sake.
