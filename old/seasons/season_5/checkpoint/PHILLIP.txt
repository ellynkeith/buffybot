(to the customer) Terribly sorry for the inconvenience.
So... you spell it A-N-Y-A, then?
Fine. Now we can get to the questions.
Have you mastered any fighting disciplines over the years?
So you have no special skills or powers or knowledge that you bring to the mix. Neither of you.
How? Be specific.
Are you saying that the Slayer needs that level of help from you often?
Do either of you know anything about the Key?
So Buffy sometimes protects you from dangerous elements of her work?
What amount of the Slayer's time would you estimate she spends saving you or her other friends?
I think she broke my rib.
The boy? No power there.
