And your mom's doing just fine.
(to Dawn; mock-stern) Lent you his stethoscope. (extending his hand) Buffy, right? I'm Ben. I'm an intern here. I've had the pleasure of hanging out with the renowned Dr.Dawn here while your mom's been being tested.
She's doing okay now. The doctors aren't sure exactly what caused the collapse. It could have been just a dizzy spell, low blood sugar, that sort of thing.
Very unlikely.
So your mom doesn't have any history of fainting?
I think they'll be running tests for a few more hours and they'll probably want her to come back in for some follow-up tests in a couple weeks but it doesn't seem like any thing too serious.
I think you should be able to take her home in a little bit.
