(to Willow) Hey you.
I just keep thinking how cool it would be if we could get a real psychic to set up here and read fortunes and stuff.
Not me. But I'd love to just watch and learn from someone who's really good, y'know.
Hmmm.
Willow-hand...
This place creeps me out.
Piles of it. We should've brought a flashlight.
Whoa.
How'd you do that? With the light?
I taught you teeny Tinkerbell light.
