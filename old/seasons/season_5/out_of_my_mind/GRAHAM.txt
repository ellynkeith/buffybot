Riley. Can we talk? This is Agent Goodman, Agent Brown.
What's going on, man? We gotta get this taken care of. We gotta get you into an operating room.
You think I'd pull something on you?
Come <u>on</u>. You <u>know</u> Walsh pumped all those chemicals and crap into us. You got more than anyone. She messed us up bad.
Riley. I'm telling you, you need help. I'm not saying it to trick you--
I <u>know</u> it. I saw guys go through this. Remember Mason? Finally all patched up after the fight, then he got it too. He-- I'm sorry, but he's gone and it got pretty ugly. You don't want this.
Yeah. We got a guy, a doctor. He's going to take care of you and we're going to him <u>now</u>.
I'm not giving you a choice.
I'm not permitted to say...
Hyper-adrenal overload and a bunch of stuff that sounds even worse than that and it all means he's way stronger than he ought to be and feeling no pain. His heart can't take it. We've been at him for weeks about it. (then) There's a specialist waiting at Sunnydale General, fourth floor, neurology. Get Riley there, 'cause if you don't...
I'll go tell the doc there's a hold up.
And Buffy?
Nothing. But don't worry; they've gotta be here any minute now.
That's soon enough, right? I mean, if we bring him in now?
Finally.
Seventeen.
Hostile seventeen. And a blonde girl...
Where's Dr. Overheiser?
We're running out of time. We don't find the medic soon, he's not gonna make it.
Big hospital.
Forget it. Apologize later. If you're not dead.
It hurts, huh?
Pain's your friend. Pain tells you you're alive.
You had me scared. It's a good thing Buffy found you when she did, man, 'cause you were just about to detonate big time. I gotta say, she's pretty impressive.
(conversational) But you realize you don't belong here, right? This town. I mean, you're nothing here.
Come on. You know it's true. There's nothing for you here.
Right. Okay. There's "her". You used to have a mission, now you're what? The mission's boyfriend? The mission's true-love?
You belong with us.
