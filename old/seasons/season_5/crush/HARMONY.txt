Spikey...
Aren't you coming to bed?
Me, neither...
Don't you want to come in and...
Tire me out.
Tsk. You're never in the mood. (kissing his ear) We can do something different tonight.
Well... we could, I don't know... maybe play a game?
(stiltedly) Oh, I'm gonna stake you. I'm coming after you, you bad, evil vampire. And I'm gonna... <u>slay</u> you!
I'm sneaking up and I'm gonna stake you so much with my Slaying powers that I have because I'm the Chosen -- woop!
(pleased) Oh! Spike!
Who is-- (all becoming clear) Oh, wait, I get it. (to Spike) Our little sex game was just the beginning... Now you've gone and picked up some cheap Queen of the Damned to dress up like your precious Droodzilla.
And you better not be thinking what I think you're thinking, 'cause my answer's the same as always... No threesomes unless it's boy-boy-girl. (beat) Or Charlize Theron.
Oh. Well, you've got some nerve showing up like this, after all this time. After breaking my sweet Boo-boo's heart...
Do you have any idea how hard it's been to break down the walls he put up after you left? I mean, serious "trust issues..."
And it's no use crawling back to him now, 'cause Spikey don't play that anymore, Morticia--
Why? Because <i>she's</i> back?
What about me, Spike? Huh? Forget about me again? The <u>actual</u> girlfriend?
I gave you the best... bunch of months... of my life. I did everything to please you. Did you ever once think about <u>my</u> wants? <u>My</u> fantasies?
Well they were... deep. And beautiful. And you should have.
I thought I could change you, Spike. I thought maybe if I gave and gave and gave, you'd come around...
Maybe be a little nicer. Stop treating me like your dog. But now I see it's you! You're the dog...
Who needs to be put down--
Ow! You're on my hair!
And you can say goodbye to this... (pointing to her ass) 'Cause you're not gonna see it anymore.
Unless you run into me somewhere and... and it's me walking away from you.
But even then, I'll probably just... you know, back away.
