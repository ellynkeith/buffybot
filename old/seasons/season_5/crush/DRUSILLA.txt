Look who's come to make everything right again.
Mm-hmm.
(smiling) It is. Like lollipops at the circus. (thoughtful) Although... didn't care for Angelus setting us on fire.
I want us to be a family again, my William. Come back with me.
(scolding) Naughty... You needn't make up stories. I already know why you're not coming.
Poor boy... Tin soldiers put funny little knickknacks in your brain. Can't hunt. Can't hurt. Can't kill. (disdain) You've got a "chip."
You misunderstand. I don't come to torture. Well... (smiles) Not you, anyway. You see...
I don't believe in science. All those bits and molecules no one's ever seen. I trust eyes and heart alone. And do you know what mine are singing out now?
You're a killer.
Born to slash and bash and bleed like beautiful poetry. No little tinkertoy ever could stop you from flowing.
All in your head.
I can see it. Little bit of plastic spiderwebbing out nasty blue shocks - and every one, is a lie. Electricity lies, Spike. It tells you you're not a bad dog. But you are.
You're my bad dog and you bite.
And there you are...
My darling, deadly boy.
My boy's been feeding again...
But I know what he really wants to eat.
Shall we tie her up and play with her a teensy bit first?
Oo, I like it when you're all dour and straight-to-business-like. All right, then... (eyeing Buffy) Let's put our little toy away. Back in its box. With posies and pennies for--UUUUhh!
Not nice to change the game in mid-play, Spike... You've taken my chair and the music hasn't stopped.
(pouting) I think I shall be very cross with you when I'm free again.
(through her laughter) But it's so funny... I knew... before you did... I knew you loved the Slayer. The pixies in my head whispered it to me... I thought they would fly away...
Oh, we can, you know. We can love quite well... (looking at Spike bemused) If not wisely.
(moved) Tsk. Aww. Oww--
Yes. Please. I like that game much better.
Am I?
(to Harm) That's right, little girl. Teach our naughty boy a lesson. Such a disappointment to all of us, he is.
Hear the pretty music? It's a dirge I think... For your funeral... (a quizzical look) But it's not here...
Poor Spike... So lost. Even I can't help you now.
