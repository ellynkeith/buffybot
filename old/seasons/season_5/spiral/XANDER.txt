Go, Buff!
Right. Piano. Because that's what we used to kill that big demon that  one time. No, wait. That was a  rocket launcher. Ahn, what are you talkin'?
That's not what she meant.  (to Buffy, uncertain)  Is it?
What about wheels? I don't think  everybody's gonna fit in the Xan-mobile.
We gotta be Sergeant Rock! Cool and collected in the face of overwhelming odds.
The hell we do.
Buffy, come on, he --
Anybody else a little queasy?
Just give it a rest or --
--or you're going to be Undead Man  <u>Walking</u>. See how fast you hitch a  ride with a flaming thumb.
That guy is bloodsucking the last nerve right out of me.
I don't know if Buffy's thinking too  clear on that one. Or anything else  right now. I've never seen her so..
Yeah, she'll... (weakly) Yeah.
Arrows! They're throwing arrows!
(trying not to vomit) Did we shake 'em?
Where?
We got company -- and they brought a Crusade!
(indicating Will's nose) Will.
Whoa, hey, uh... this is war, isn't it?  And if there's one thing I've learned  from Sergeant Rock, in war there are  rules. Or at least there should be...  if you're as "honorable" as you think you are. (a beat) Plus we do have your General Forehead Guy.
You know those things'll kill you.
(re: Spike's hands) How are the feelers?
Not like we have much of a choice.
Great plan. And while all the hacking  and slashing's going on, what are you  going to be doing? Throwing migraines at 'em?
