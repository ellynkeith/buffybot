Mom? Hey...
Xander! (to Joyce) I'll give you a hand.
(looking) No, it's just... blackened. It's Cajun pie.
Hey, as long as you two stay off the band candy, I'm cool with anything.
I live to torment you. Is that so wrong?
See, look, we can just cut off the burnt part of the crust --
Mom! Mom!
Hello?
It's my mom. She's not, she's not breathing!
No, I can't -- she's not breathing --
What?
1630 Revello. It's a, a house. Revello near Hadley.
Yes --
No, I came home -- what do I do?
I -- I don't remember --
Yeah, yeah, I know this, God --
Something broke!
No!
She's cold.
No, mom -- should I make her warm?
Well, when are they coming?
Giles. You have to come.
She's at the house.
I -- I found her -- a few minutes --
No, she -- no.
What?
Yes.
No, I mean, she, there was a tumor. Brain tumor -- She had an operation and now she's fine. She's been fine.
I'm right here!
What else? What now? What do we...
What did I...
Someone's coming.
Thank you.
I'm waiting... the coroner's coming.
I have to tell Dawn... she's at school... I'll go there...
No don't, it's too late, don't --
We're not, they're coming for her, don't --
Dawn.
I know. Please come with me.
Let's go outside...
It's... bad. News.
Dawn, it's bad, I think we should --
Mom had an accident, or a, something went wrong from the tumor...
Dawn, Mom died this morning. While we were both at school, she --
I don't know exactly what happened, but, she's dead...
(crying anew) Dawnie...
I know...
I know.
Dawn. Not now.
Shouldn't we have know about, that that was a danger...
Mom?
You're sure there wasn't a lot of pain?
(nodding) Please.
We'll be here.
Nothing. I mean, it was what they thought. From the... tumor...
Giles is gonna go over the paperwork.
I don't think we'll have to stay here very long.
What about what?
Do you want someone to go with you?
Well, okay, do you know where --
I think maybe she's mad at me or something.
Meltdown. She just, wouldn't believe it. I don't know if she does now.
Thank you.
Maybe... I honestly can't tell.
Well, maybe Dawn could use a snack...
I'm sorry you have to go through all this.
Everyone wants to help... I don't even know... if I'm here... I don't know what's going on. I've never done this -- Well that's just an amazingly dumb thing to say, obviously. "I've never done this before."
I didn't know that. I'm sorry --
Was it sudden?
Your mother...
Uh-huh.
I'm just not hungry.
I guess...
Dawn? Are you okay? Are you okay?
It's not her. It's not her. She's gone.
