I'm getting no pulse.
Let's lay her out...
Was she conscious?
I'm bagging her --
We're gonna intubate, just trying to get her to breathe. Is this your mother?
Does she have any serious physical health problems, any history --
We got her!
Let's get her on the truck NOW!
Man, we never brought one back that late --
It's a miracle, that's what it is, a beautiful miracle --
She's cold, man...
I'm sorry, but I have to tell you that your mother is dead.
I'm guessing it may have been an aneurism, or some clotting, some complication from surgery, she probably felt very little pain. I'm gonna call it in, the coroner's office will come by to take her in and they'll determine the cause of death conclusively.
(into radio) We're moving.
Okay. (to the second paramedic) We gotta fly.
I'm gonna call right away, but the coroner's office could take a little while. The police may come too, for a report. In the meanwhile, you should sit, have a glass of water... Try not to disturb the body. Do you need anything? Is there someone you can call?
Let's go.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
