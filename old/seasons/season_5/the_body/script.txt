BUFFY: Mom? Hey...
JOYCE: I think we're just about ready for pie.
XANDER: And then I'll be pretty much ready for barf!
BUFFY: Xander! (to Joyce) I'll give you a hand.
DAWN: (over Buffy) Gross!
XANDER: No, no, barf from eating, 'cause all was good, and too much goodness --
JOYCE: I'm taking it as a compliment.
GILES: Yes, everything was delicious...
ANYA: Yes, I'm going to barf too!
JOYCE: (affectionately sarcastic) Everyone's so sweet.
XANDER: How're you doing there, Will? Are you in the barf club?
WILLOW: I had too much nog.
TARA: Oh, baby, do you want me to rub your tummy? (to Xander and Anya) She likes it when I... stop explaining things.
DAWN: My nog tasted funny. I think I got one with rum in it.
WILLOW: That's bad.
XANDER: Yeah, now Santa's gonna pass you right by, naughty boozehound.
WILLOW: He always passes me by. Something always puts him off. Could be the big honkin' menorah.
TARA: (to Dawn) Did you write him a letter?
XANDER: What'd you ask for?
DAWN: Uh, guys, hello? Puberty? Sort of figured out the "no Santa" thing.
ANYA: That's a myth.
DAWN: Yeah.
ANYA: No, it's a myth that it's a myth. There is a Santa Claus.
XANDER: Advantage of a thousand year old girlfriend. Inside scoop.
TARA: There's a Santa Claus?
ANYA: Been around since, like, the 1500's. I mean, he wasn't always called Santa, but, Christmas night, flying reindeer, coming down the chimney -- all true.
DAWN: All true?
ANYA: Well, he doesn't traditionally bring presents so much as, you know, disembowel children, but, otherwise...
TARA: (meekly) Well, the reindeer part was nice...
JOYCE: Dammit, I hate this oven. It's burnt.
BUFFY: (looking) No, it's just... blackened. It's Cajun pie.
GILES: Shall I open another?
JOYCE: Do you think we dare?
BUFFY: Hey, as long as you two stay off the band candy, I'm cool with anything.
JOYCE: (to Buffy) You are a demon child.
BUFFY: I live to torment you. Is that so wrong?
JOYCE: It's a daughter's duty, I suppose...
BUFFY: See, look, we can just cut off the burnt part of the crust --
BUFFY: Mom! Mom!
BUFFY: Hello?
BUFFY: It's my mom. She's not, she's not breathing!
BUFFY: No, I can't -- she's not breathing --
BUFFY: What?
BUFFY: 1630 Revello. It's a, a house. Revello near Hadley.
BUFFY: Yes --
BUFFY: No, I came home -- what do I do?
BUFFY: I -- I don't remember --
BUFFY: Yeah, yeah, I know this, God --
BUFFY: Something broke!
BUFFY: No!
BUFFY: She's cold.
BUFFY: No, mom -- should I make her warm?
BUFFY: Well, when are they coming?
BUFFY: Giles. You have to come.
BUFFY: She's at the house.
PARAMEDIC: I'm getting no pulse.
PARAMEDIC: Let's lay her out...
BUFFY: I -- I found her -- a few minutes --
PARAMEDIC: Was she conscious?
BUFFY: No, she -- no.
PARAMEDIC: I'm bagging her --
BUFFY: What?
PARAMEDIC: We're gonna intubate, just trying to get her to breathe. Is this your mother?
BUFFY: Yes.
PARAMEDIC: Does she have any serious physical health problems, any history --
BUFFY: No, I mean, she, there was a tumor. Brain tumor -- She had an operation and now she's fine. She's been fine.
PARAMEDIC: We got her!
PARAMEDIC: Let's get her on the truck NOW!
JOYCE: (barely a whisper) Buffy...
BUFFY: I'm right here!
PARAMEDIC: Man, we never brought one back that late --
PARAMEDIC: It's a miracle, that's what it is, a beautiful miracle --
DOCTOR: Good as new...
JOYCE: Oh, Buffy, thank god you found me...
PARAMEDIC: She's cold, man...
BUFFY: What else? What now? What do we...
PARAMEDIC: I'm sorry, but I have to tell you that your mother is dead.
BUFFY: What did I...
PARAMEDIC: I'm guessing it may have been an aneurism, or some clotting, some complication from surgery, she probably felt very little pain. I'm gonna call it in, the coroner's office will come by to take her in and they'll determine the cause of death conclusively.
PARAMEDIC: (into radio) We're moving.
PARAMEDIC: Okay. (to the second paramedic) We gotta fly.
PARAMEDIC: I'm gonna call right away, but the coroner's office could take a little while. The police may come too, for a report. In the meanwhile, you should sit, have a glass of water... Try not to disturb the body. Do you need anything? Is there someone you can call?
BUFFY: Someone's coming.
PARAMEDIC: Let's go.
PARAMEDIC: I'm very sorry for your loss.
BUFFY: Thank you.
GILES: Buffy! What is it? Is it Glory?
BUFFY: I'm waiting... the coroner's coming.
GILES: What?
BUFFY: I have to tell Dawn... she's at school... I'll go there...
GILES: Buffy, I'm not --
BUFFY: No don't, it's too late, don't --
GILES: Joyce. Joyce!
BUFFY: We're not, they're coming for her, don't --
DAWN: I can't believe it. Oh, God...
LISA: It's not that bad.
DAWN: How can you say it's not that bad?
LISA: I just don't think it's that big a deal.
DAWN: Kevin Berman called me a freak. In front of everyone -- no, that's no big deal.
LISA: He didn't say you were a freak.
DAWN: (sniffling) Forget it.
LISA: He said you were freaky. Which, you know, freaky can be cool.
DAWN: Yeah, real cool. I'm a suicidal headcase.
LISA: You <b>know</b> it was Kirstie. She was telling everyone how you were into cutting yourself --
DAWN: That's such a lie! I got cut -- by accident -- one time. Now Kevin thinks...
LISA: Well, that was when you were wigging out about your family and stuff -- And of course Kirstie's gotta turn everything into a story, she was telling everyone you were adopted --
DAWN: What a primo Bee-otch. I swear, if I could make her head explode using only the power of my mind, that's what I'd be doing right about now.
LISA: Yeah, you can't go out there all cry- face, it'll just give Kirstie more ammo.
DAWN: You know, my big sister could beat the crap out of her. I mean, really really.
LISA: Yeah, you're good to go. We're gonna be late, anyway.
DAWN: Oh great, it's Art. I'm not gonna be able to look Kevin in the eye.
LISA: You've <b>never</b> looked Kevin in the eye. At least now he knows your name.
DAWN: Yeah, freaky psycho gal.
LISA: Come on. Let's represent.
LISA: Have you studied at all for Geometry?
DAWN: Some. It's pretty much baby stuff.
LISA: I don't have a math brain.
DAWN: We can go over it during study hall --
LISA: Kirstie alert...
KIRSTIE: Hey, Dawn.
DAWN: Hey.
KIRSTIE: How're you doing? You okay?
DAWN: Good, thanks for asking.
LISA: Bee-otch...
TEACHER: Okay, remember, we're not drawing the object, we're drawing the negative space around the object. We just draw the edges of the figure, and then give me a sense of the spaces around, the space in between.
KEVIN: Hey.
DAWN: Oh. Hey Kevin.
KEVIN: What's going on?
DAWN: (has no answer) Negative space.
KEVIN: Yeah, what's that all about?
DAWN: (too cool) Shhyeah.
KEVIN: That's pretty good.
DAWN: Thanks.
KEVIN: So, I heard you, like, had a freak out and cut yourself.
DAWN: (embarrassed) Not even. That was a whole... that was so...
KEVIN: I've felt like that sometimes. Things get so crazed, you know, I just wanna... do something extreme.
DAWN: Yeah. I just, I had some intense stuff going on. Lotta people don't get that. Pain.
KEVIN: Yeah.
DAWN: And then Kirstie's blabbing it everywhere. 'Cause she's...
KEVIN: Kirstie, man... she's kinda hot.
DAWN: (bummed) Oh.
KEVIN: But I don't think she's ever had a single thought in her brain.
DAWN: (laughs) I know. She's so superficial. Everything's like, clothes, and who likes who, and there's just way more important stuff going on. There's a lot of crucial, you know, stuff.
KEVIN: Yeah.
DAWN: (laughing) This one time, we were in History, and she had this book, Annals of History, only she didn't know how to say 'annals' and she kept calling it --
BUFFY: Dawn.
DAWN: Well, what -- can't it wait? I'm in the middle of class...
BUFFY: I know. Please come with me.
DAWN: I though Mom was gonna pick me up...
DAWN: What's going on. Something's going on.
BUFFY: Let's go outside...
DAWN: No. Tell me what's going on.
BUFFY: It's... bad. News.
DAWN: What is it? What happened?
BUFFY: Dawn, it's bad, I think we should --
DAWN: Where's Mom?
BUFFY: Mom had an accident, or a, something went wrong from the tumor...
DAWN: Is she okay? Is she -- but she's okay... but it's serious but...
BUFFY: Dawn, Mom died this morning. While we were both at school, she --
DAWN: No...
BUFFY: I don't know exactly what happened, but, she's dead...
DAWN: No. NO NO No No you're lying you're lying she's fine she's FINE and you're lying oh no no please please no you're lying she's fine, she's fine...
BUFFY: (crying anew) Dawnie...
DAWN: It's not true it's not real it's not real ohhhhh noooooo....... no.....
TARA: I think they're here.
XANDER: Do you want to wait here?
ANYA: You're double parked.
XANDER: Let 'em give me a ticket.
WILLOW: What do you think? The purple, right? 'Cause it's somber, it should be something somber. No, it's depressing, it's like I'm a funeral... guy. (re: other blouse) This is cheerier -- maybe I want to be cheery, like everything is normal, but that's rude, it's disrespectful, la-la-la I don't care...
TARA: I can look again...
WILLOW: No, I think... I should wear the purple, I think the purple, it's just that it's so, I don't know... it doesn't mean something bad?
TARA: I think it's royal. Purple means royalty.
WILLOW: Well I can't see Buffy at the morgue and be all royal! "Oh, I'm the king of everything, I'm better than you..." (tearing up again) I have to be supportive, Buffy needs me to... why do so many of my shirts have stupid things on them? Can't I dress like a grown up, can't I be... be a grown up...
TARA: Shhh...
WILLOW: Tara...
TARA: Shhhhhh, darling...
WILLOW: I can't do this...
TARA: We can do this.
WILLOW: Okay... We can be there for Buffy... and Dawn... little Dawn...
TARA: We can be strong.
WILLOW: Strong like an Amazon?
TARA: (with a small affectionate smile) Strong like an Amazon, right...
WILLOW: Okay...
ANYA: So what do we do?
XANDER: I'm not sure. Willow talked to Giles.
ANYA: But, what will we do? What will we be expected to do?
XANDER: Hey...
XANDER: How are you doing?
WILLOW: I'm afraid I'm gonna start crying again, and I don't wanna.. but maybe I should get it out of my system, so I don't do it in front of Buffy.
ANYA: Xander cried at the apartment. It was strange.
WILLOW: (only slightly acerbic) It's a thing we do.
XANDER: This is so totally wrong. This is just so... it's wrong.
ANYA: What's going to happen?
WILLOW: I guess we're gonna meet them at the morgue. That's where they were taking her.
TARA: Giles said that he was gonna go with Joyce and Buffy was going to... to school. To tell Dawn.
XANDER: God.
TARA: (to Xander) Do you know how to get to --
XANDER: Yeah. It's at the hospital, it's a wing. (beat) We do morgue time in the scoobie gang.
WILLOW: I have to change.
XANDER: (to Tara) What else did Giles say?
TARA: Not a lot.
XANDER: Are they sure this was... natural? I mean, Glory...
TARA: Giles is pretty sure it wasn't her.
XANDER: But I mean, she said she was gonna come after Buffy's family --
TARA: I don't think --
XANDER: (overlapping) I mean we should be going after her, I mean she could have done it and, and covered her tracks.
WILLOW: (re-emerging) Why would she? She'd want us to know.
XANDER: I'll tell you what it is, it's the frickin' doctors, I mean they just let her out, you know, "clean bill a health, dig a hole in your skull here's a band-aid NEXT!"
ANYA: Xander...
XANDER: Am I wrong?
WILLOW: They said there could be complications --
XANDER: Complications? Seems pretty simple to me. They shoulda checked her over, they shoulda had her in, what, she's got a clot? We don't have enough monsters in this town the doctors gotta help 'em out?
WILLOW: I don't think anybody's... it just happened.
XANDER: Things don't happen! I mean they don't JUST happen. Somebody's... I mean somebody's gotta...
WILLOW: Okay.
XANDER: You know I can't take you.
WILLOW: Damn straight...
ANYA: Are we gonna see the body?
WILLOW: (flinching) What?
ANYA: Are we going to be in the room with the dead body?
WILLOW: I don't know! No.
TARA: But I guess we can take over patrolling and all that.
XANDER: Yeah --
WILLOW: Oh yeah --
TARA: For however long...
WILLOW: We gotta help out. There's gonna be a lot of things... We gotta make everything easy as possible on Buffy.
XANDER: You know it.
WILLOW: I can't wear this. (to Tara) I really should have the other... Joyce liked it so...
TARA: Do you think you could have left it in the laundry room?
WILLOW: Maybe...
TARA: I'll go check. (to the others) I'll be one minute.
XANDER: We're cool.
WILLOW: Yeah.
ANYA: Are they gonna cut the body open?
WILLOW: (appalled) Oh my god will you shut your mouth? Just not open it please?
ANYA: What am I doing?
WILLOW: How can you act like that?
ANYA: Am I supposed to be changing my clothes a lot, is that the helpful thing to do --
XANDER: Guys...
WILLOW: The way you behave --
ANYA: Well nobody will tell me --
WILLOW: Because it's not okay for you to be asking these things!
ANYA: But I don't <b>understand</b>!
WILLOW: (softly) We don't know. How it works. Or why.
XANDER: Sorry. Sorry.
WILLOW: Xander...
XANDER: As I was saying, some frustration, and now... I appear to be stuck.
ANYA: Oh my god! Is your hand okay?
XANDER: Pretty much. I'm really sorry.
ANYA: What if you hit an electrical thing? You... are stupid!
XANDER: And once again with the sorry.
WILLOW: Did it make you feel better?
XANDER: For a second there.
WILLOW: A whole second.
XANDER: In my defense, some crappy wallmanship here.
WILLOW: Yeah, you can hear everything next door...
XANDER: Who did the drywall on this place?
WILLOW: I always forget to ask.
TARA: Did I miss something?
ANYA: Xander decided that he blames the wall.
WILLOW: (to Xander) Can you turn your wrist...
XANDER: Hold on...
ANYA: Ohh...
XANDER: It's okay.
TARA: It hurts.
XANDER: (smiling softly) Yeah.
WILLOW: Wash it off. Here.
ANYA: Band aids?
WILLOW: Underneath.
TARA: I couldn't find it.
WILLOW: It doesn't matter.
TARA: Yes.
WILLOW: I wanna be there for Buffy.
XANDER: You're right. Avengers got to get with the assembling.
ANYA: How are we going to help?
XANDER: (hugging Buffy) Anything we can do...
DAWN: (hugging Tara) I'm glad you guys came...
WILLOW: I love you so much...
BUFFY: I know...
WILLOW: And...
BUFFY: I know.
DAWN: (to Tara and Xander) They're not telling us anything.
GILES: Doctor...
DOCTOR: Okay, I've examined your mother's body --
DAWN: Can we see her?
BUFFY: Dawn. Not now.
DOCTOR: The on-site report seems to be more or less accurate. Your mother did have what looks like an aneurism, a sudden hemorrhaging from a ruptured arterial vessel near the, where the tumor was removed.
BUFFY: Shouldn't we have know about, that that was a danger...
DOCTOR: Sometimes these things are detectable and sometimes they're not. Joyce was aware of the possibility of a rupture, and the effects. She didn't even get on the phone so clearly this was very sudden. She may have felt a little nausea and probably passed out as it happened. I doubt there was much pain, and even if someone had been by her side --
JOYCE: My head...
BUFFY: Mom?
DOCTOR: -- it's doubtful this could have been dealt with in time.
GILES: Well, thank you, Doctor...
BUFFY: You're sure there wasn't a lot of pain?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I think we can be almost positive about that.
GILES: What, ah, what needs to happen now?
DOCTOR: Well, there will be some forms, and some decisions you'll need to make...
GILES: Buffy, why don't you let me handle those as much as I can..
BUFFY: (nodding) Please.
DOCTOR: (to Buffy) We will need you to sign a couple of release forms --
GILES: (a bit short) Yes, thank you, Doctor -- (to Buffy) I'll figure out which ones you need to see.
BUFFY: We'll be here.
XANDER: What'd the doctor say?
BUFFY: Nothing. I mean, it was what they thought. From the... tumor...
WILLOW: Why don't we sit down.
BUFFY: Giles is gonna go over the paperwork.
XANDER: Man, if there's one day they should not give you homework...
WILLOW: Dawnie, do you wanna sit?
BUFFY: I don't think we'll have to stay here very long.
DAWN: But what about --
BUFFY: What about what?
DAWN: Nothing. I have to pee.
BUFFY: Do you want someone to go with you?
DAWN: No. I still remember how to pee.
BUFFY: Well, okay, do you know where --
DAWN: Yeah.
BUFFY: I think maybe she's mad at me or something.
WILLOW: 'Cause you're the one that told her?
XANDER: How'd she take it?
BUFFY: Meltdown. She just, wouldn't believe it. I don't know if she does now.
TARA: She's been through so much this year...
WILLOW: You both have.
ANYA: (blurts out) I wish that Joyce didn't die.
XANDER: Anya, ever the wordsmith...
BUFFY: Thank you.
WILLOW: (to Buffy) Do you want anything? Something to eat, or a soda?
BUFFY: Maybe... I honestly can't tell.
WILLOW: I think you should try to eat something...
BUFFY: Well, maybe Dawn could use a snack...
WILLOW: I'll see if there's something. Xander, do you have any money?
XANDER: We'll come with.
WILLOW: We'll be real quick.
BUFFY: I'm sorry you have to go through all this.
TARA: You don't have to worry about me.
BUFFY: Everyone wants to help... I don't even know... if I'm here... I don't know what's going on. I've never done this -- Well that's just an amazingly dumb thing to say, obviously. "I've never done this before."
TARA: I have.
BUFFY: I didn't know that. I'm sorry --
TARA: No, no, I didn't mean to -- I'm only telling you because, it's not m-my place, but... there's things, thoughts and reactions that I had, that I couldn't... understand, or even try to explain to anyone else. Thoughts that made me feel like I was losing it, or like I was just a h-horrible person. I know it's different for you, because it's always different, but... if you ever need...
BUFFY: Was it sudden?
TARA: What?
BUFFY: Your mother...
TARA: No. (thinks a moment) And yes. (beat) It's always sudden.
WILLOW: We panicked.
BUFFY: Uh-huh.
WILLOW: Take anything you want...
ANYA: The sandwiches are meat.
BUFFY: I'm just not hungry.
WILLOW: What about Dawnie?
XANDER: She still in the bathroom?
BUFFY: I guess...
XANDER: Sure.
BUFFY: Dawn? Are you okay? Are you okay?
DAWN: Is she cold?
BUFFY: It's not her. It's not her. She's gone.
DAWN: Where'd she go?
