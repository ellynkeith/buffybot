I had too much nog.
That's bad.
He always passes me by. Something always puts him off. Could be the big honkin' menorah.
What do you think? The purple, right? 'Cause it's somber, it should be something somber. No, it's depressing, it's like I'm a funeral... guy. (re: other blouse) This is cheerier -- maybe I want to be cheery, like everything is normal, but that's rude, it's disrespectful, la-la-la I don't care...
No, I think... I should wear the purple, I think the purple, it's just that it's so, I don't know... it doesn't mean something bad?
Well I can't see Buffy at the morgue and be all royal! "Oh, I'm the king of everything, I'm better than you..." (tearing up again) I have to be supportive, Buffy needs me to... why do so many of my shirts have stupid things on them? Can't I dress like a grown up, can't I be... be a grown up...
Tara...
I can't do this...
Okay... We can be there for Buffy... and Dawn... little Dawn...
Strong like an Amazon?
Okay...
I'm afraid I'm gonna start crying again, and I don't wanna.. but maybe I should get it out of my system, so I don't do it in front of Buffy.
(only slightly acerbic) It's a thing we do.
I guess we're gonna meet them at the morgue. That's where they were taking her.
I have to change.
(re-emerging) Why would she? She'd want us to know.
They said there could be complications --
I don't think anybody's... it just happened.
Okay.
Damn straight...
(flinching) What?
I don't know! No.
Oh yeah --
We gotta help out. There's gonna be a lot of things... We gotta make everything easy as possible on Buffy.
I can't wear this. (to Tara) I really should have the other... Joyce liked it so...
Maybe...
Yeah.
(appalled) Oh my god will you shut your mouth? Just not open it please?
How can you act like that?
The way you behave --
Because it's not okay for you to be asking these things!
(softly) We don't know. How it works. Or why.
Xander...
Did it make you feel better?
A whole second.
Yeah, you can hear everything next door...
I always forget to ask.
(to Xander) Can you turn your wrist...
Wash it off. Here.
Underneath.
It doesn't matter.
I wanna be there for Buffy.
I love you so much...
And...
Why don't we sit down.
Dawnie, do you wanna sit?
'Cause you're the one that told her?
You both have.
(to Buffy) Do you want anything? Something to eat, or a soda?
I think you should try to eat something...
I'll see if there's something. Xander, do you have any money?
We'll be real quick.
We panicked.
Take anything you want...
What about Dawnie?
