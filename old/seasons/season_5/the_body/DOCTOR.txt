Good as new...
Okay, I've examined your mother's body --
The on-site report seems to be more or less accurate. Your mother did have what looks like an aneurism, a sudden hemorrhaging from a ruptured arterial vessel near the, where the tumor was removed.
Sometimes these things are detectable and sometimes they're not. Joyce was aware of the possibility of a rupture, and the effects. She didn't even get on the phone so clearly this was very sudden. She may have felt a little nausea and probably passed out as it happened. I doubt there was much pain, and even if someone had been by her side --
-- it's doubtful this could have been dealt with in time.
Absolutely. I think we can be almost positive about that.
Well, there will be some forms, and some decisions you'll need to make...
(to Buffy) We will need you to sign a couple of release forms --
