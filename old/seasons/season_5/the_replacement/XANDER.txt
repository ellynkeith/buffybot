Wish I had something foodlike to  offer you guys, but the hot plate's  out of commission.
Huh, guess the folks are back.
(embarrassed) No, No. I was wrong. Just  incompetent burglars
Maybe it's time to start looking  for a new place… Something a  little nicer. Buffy, you've been to  Hell. They had one-bedrooms, right?
Incompletely dubbed kung fu. Our most valuable Chinese import.
(Still focused on fight) What? Oh - yeah… She's all "What's that?  A Cauldron? Who uses a cauldron anymore?"
Hey, we're just looking. The  rent's way high, so don't get  your hopes all carbonated.
No. I have Albert. Which is  me doing an important-voice. (important voice) Xander Harris? An excellent  tenant and a very nice - looking fellow…
Hey.
I brought my friends.
They wouldn't always be around.
You guys. You can't save it for the bedroom?
An application? I can't just, like, tell  you my references? 'Cuz there's Albert-
Oh, Credit check. Little check on the  credit. See how credible my checks are, ha ha.
Um, let's talk <u>quietly</u> over there. (to the manager) Excuse us.
I told you. The construction job is ending, I'm not going to have any money coming in.  And, by the way, you <u>do</u> have your own place.
Not forever. Just until things come together…
Quiet, please. Anya, what is this? What's going on with you?
(forced smile) Guess I'll just start on that application. Think you'll like it. I've been told I have lovely penmanship.
So you bought the magic shop and you were attacked before it even opened. Who's up for a swingin' chorus of the "We Told You So" symphony?
So it's off to the old factory. I hate that place. (off there looks) I'm joking. I know what it means. He smelled.
Watch out!
I'm okay…I'm fine…
(half asleep) Anya? Are you trying to use the hot plate again?
Uh-oh.
So, you take the bullet for the swinging  Scooby-friends and what do you get?  A pat on the head? A tasteful medal?  No! You get left for dead under a light  layer of moldy socks and banana peels!
Anya! Ahn?!
What - - No way! Who is … me? What am I doing in there?
Buffy. Need Buffy
No, it <u>ate</u> my quarter… Uh - huh. But, see, I'm having this sort of  aggressively bad day… Ohh!…. I found a quarter! I found a quarter!… Well, ma'am, for me it <u>is</u> worth getting excited about.
Come on, Buffy.
Welcome to payback, mister evil-plan face-stealer. You take my life, you get my being-fired absolutely free!
I knew they were gonna notice that...
What? Why isn't he firing me-- him?
A promotion?! But he... I mean, I didn't - Doesn't he see the shiny thing?!
'Mr. Harris'? Yeah, right.
She's coming on to me! Him! Please lady, that is so not me! He's too clean for one thing and his socks are all matchy and-
Yaaaa!
I won't let you do this! You can't do this to me!
Oh man. I need Buffy.
She sees it's not me. (prayer) C'mon Buffy... resist his spell... do this for me.
Stupid dorms, all sitting there, being all the same looking. Where are you, Willow?
(yells) Willow!
Willow!
Don't be scared, Will. Just listen. It's me, Xander. And I can prove it.
Let's see... stuff only you and me know. Okay, for my seventh birthday I wanted  a toy fire truck and I didn't get it and you were really nice about it and then the house next door burned down and real fire trucks came and for years I thought you set the fire for me. And if you did, you can tell me. (beat) And for a while last year I thought I was  lactose intolerant but it was just some bad brie. And, by the way, if I had time to prepare, I'd have way better material than this. (beat) Oh! Every Christmas we watch Charlie Brown together and I do the Snoopy dance!
Yes!! Yes! I will keep going until I have you convinced!
A-<u>ha</u>! You called me Xander!
Oh. Huh.
Okay. I woke up in the dump this morning--
No. The dump. The city dump. Got hit last night. Fell down boom. Woke up in the morning.
(scared) You walked... Will, did I do anything weird? Did I wave any shiny things around?
Last night. That wasn't me. There's a double out there. Some... thing that's stolen my face. It's going around pretending it's me and it's hypnotizing people. It even got to Buffy and Giles and Riley. It's with them right now and they have no idea.
It's a robot! An evil robot constructed from evil parts that look like me and are designed to do evil!
<u>Or</u>, it's <u>Toth</u>!
A demon. A demon has taken my life from me. And he's living it better than I do.
(numbly) Right. Whatever.
But I <u>never</u> help. I get in trouble and Buffy saves me.
(tired) I'm just... another great humiliation. And this time it's even worse. This demon, he's like,  taking my life and, everyone's treating him... everyone's treating him like a grown-up. Well, I'm starting to feel like...
Like, it's doing everything better, it's smarter and... I don't know. Maybe I should just let it have it. Take my life, please.
Why not? It's not like I was doing anything  so great with it. When I get to the pearly gates, I don't think the guy's going to go - "What a kick ass comic book collection, come on it!" (then) What have I got that's even worth...
Anya.
She won't know, he can just... (rallying) No. No way. He can take anything he wants, but not her. I need her.
He could be with her now...
Figure out a spell. Something revealy. I gotta find her.
Hey, wait 'til you have an evil twin, see how <u>you</u> handle it!
Anya? Ahn?
Gotta be here. Where is it?
Get away from her!
Anya! It's me!
No!
<u>He's</u> the demon! Or possibly a robot! Look at me Anya! Look in my eyes! Can't you see it's me?
(desperate) Please! Look at him! Listen to him! He's all smooth! You have to know me!
I'm thinking less.
(to Anya) Let go! I have to kill the demon-bot!
No! Buffy! I'm me! Help me!
I am!
Ow!
He <u>can't</u> be me. He's all... fancy.
No. We're not the same. We're all different.
What different properties?
But he has a thing! In his pocket! A shiny disk that stuns and disorients!
Cover your eyes! It'll melt your brain!
No! It-- Huh. It is kinda cool. Washington's still there, but he's all smooshy. And he  may be Jefferson.
The gun! Pick up the little gun-pieces!
I was thinking the same thought. (a brand new thought for him) Hey-- do you suppose we're <u>both</u> Xander?
(jovial) Look and admire, ladies.
(same jovial tone) Okay, back off, ladies.
Yeah, we checked over some stuff in the car on the way over. (quickly) Fingerprints.
No she's <u>not</u>! She entirely wants to have sex with us together! It's wrong, and, and... it would be very confusing!
Now, hold on a sec. If you weren't putting the whammy on people with the shiny thing? How did you do it? How'd you get the promotion?
I am?
(smiling) Hey, how about that girl, the apartment manager?
(to Willow) Summon the goddess, chant the chant. Let's do it.
You sure you know how to do this?
You've got to be kidding. "Let the spell be ended"? That's not gonna work! Oh.
Will, I got a job and an apartment. If the hair's grooving along with the new vibe, I'm okay with it.
Yeah. But, really... it was too weird. And my... Um... less cool half... a sweetheart of a guy, but still, just on the clumsiness issue alone, I don't think anyone would've wanted him around much.
I don't know. At first it's just a place, and then you start to make memories and then it's like... that's where Spike slept, and there... that's where Anya and I drowned the Separvo demon and right here, here's where my heart got all ripped out... I really hate this place.
Not unless you want my collection of Babylon 5 commemorative plates. (beat) Which you cannot have. I just thought you could help carry a little.
Anya. Please.
How is it that she can always make me feel like Suave Xander has left the building?
Still, I do envy you sometimes. I mean, for the sanity. Not that I'm still into Buffy. Not that I ever was.
