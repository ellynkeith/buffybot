XANDER: Wish I had something foodlike to  offer you guys, but the hot plate's  out of commission.
ANYA: We think the cat peed on it.
XANDER: Huh, guess the folks are back.
XANDER: (embarrassed) No, No. I was wrong. Just  incompetent burglars
XANDER: Maybe it's time to start looking  for a new place… Something a  little nicer. Buffy, you've been to  Hell. They had one-bedrooms, right?
RILEY: Hey, Buffy…how's that book? Full of zippy dates and zesty names?
BUFFY: (absently) I'm fine.
BUFFY: Hey! I was enjoying the studying!
RILEY: Who are you lately? Give it up and watch the movie.
BUFFY: Well it has been a long hard day with the  crusades. Guess I could take a little break  from the violence for some…. (sees the screen) Ooh! Fighting!
XANDER: Incompletely dubbed kung fu. Our most valuable Chinese import.
ANYA: Much more durable than their hot plates.
RILEY: (to Buffy) Watch the movie and relax. Here.
BUFFY: Mmm. So good. More…
ANYA: What are you doing? I have a dislocated  shoulder and I'm trying to concentrate  on the kicking movie.
BUFFY: Hey! The rubbing went away.
RILEY: Um…sorry…got caught up in the action.
BUFFY: Yeah, it's pretty good- (then, off movie) Oh, give me a break! See you'd hit the  big guy first, a flying kick. Then clear out the  little ones - bam, bam! Oh! <u>Now</u> with the  flying kick?!
RILEY: Hey, Buff. Maybe you oughtta leave the work  behind sometimes. You're not always a slayer  on duty, you know.
BUFFY: Well, it would drive you crazy if this was an army  movie and they were all, you know, saluting  backwards and, and… invading all willy-nilly.
BUFFY: Anyway, you can't blame me for being critical.  Willow's the same way when we watch movies about witches, isn't she Xander?
XANDER: (Still focused on fight) What? Oh - yeah… She's all "What's that?  A Cauldron? Who uses a cauldron anymore?"
TOTH: The last step in thy forging is my pain. The price with which I purchase the death of the Slayer.
WILLOW: (to Xander) If you get the apartment, this'll be your hallway, We'll walk down this hall going, la, la, I'm on my way to Xander's.
BUFFY: Just warning you now, Xander. I probably won't be doing that.
RILEY: Really? I will.
XANDER: Hey, we're just looking. The  rent's way high, so don't get  your hopes all carbonated.
ANYA: But you have references!
XANDER: No. I have Albert. Which is  me doing an important-voice. (important voice) Xander Harris? An excellent  tenant and a very nice - looking fellow…
WILLOW: Ooh. Big.
BUFFY: Nice. And not subterranean. Very… above-terranean.
ANYA: I want it. Pay anything.
MANAGER: Xander Harris?
RILEY: Oh. No. Riley Finn. This is Xander.
XANDER: Hey.
MANAGER: Ah.
XANDER: I brought my friends.
MANAGER: I see.
XANDER: They wouldn't always be around.
WILLOW: But we're quite and clean.
ANYA: We could have Scooby meetings in  the living room. Giles can explain  the boring things over here.
MANAGER: Phone and electricity are hooked up. There's a private balcony, ceiling fans, closet space…
XANDER: You guys. You can't save it for the bedroom?
MANAGER: I brought an application for you to fill out.
XANDER: An application? I can't just, like, tell  you my references? 'Cuz there's Albert-
MANAGER: We run your credit check based  on the application.
XANDER: Oh, Credit check. Little check on the  credit. See how credible my checks are, ha ha.
MANAGER: And we'll be asking for first, last, security and a small cleaning deposit.  The total's at the bottom of the sheet.
ANYA: He'll take it! Xander, go get the furniture, I'll wait here. (to the manager) He lives in his drunken parents' basement where something urinated on the hot plate.
XANDER: Um, let's talk <u>quietly</u> over there. (to the manager) Excuse us.
RILEY: We…um…we like the ceiling fans.
WILLOW: Very, you know, kind of Old south.
BUFFY: (quickly) But without unpleasant slavery associations.
ANYA: But why <u>can't</u> we have it?
XANDER: I told you. The construction job is ending, I'm not going to have any money coming in.  And, by the way, you <u>do</u> have your own place.
ANYA: So when I want to visit you I  have to be in that awful basement?
XANDER: Not forever. Just until things come together…
ANYA: Which is when, Xander? 'Cause right now things are looking pretty un-together and you can't expect me to just wait around-
XANDER: Quiet, please. Anya, what is this? What's going on with you?
ANYA: What's going on is my arm is hurt and I'm tired and I don't really feel like finishing the tour of beautiful things I can't have.
XANDER: (forced smile) Guess I'll just start on that application. Think you'll like it. I've been told I have lovely penmanship.
GILES: "Miscellaneous curses." Brilliant. Be lucky not to curse my hands right off.
GILES: Gahhhh!
TOTH: The Slayer is not here.
GILES: Rabbit's foot. No, wait.
TOTH: That is a fertility god. Feeble man, you are not likely to strike mortal fear into-
TOTH: You are not the Slayer. You do not concern me
GILES: Like this… and this!
RILEY: That's thing's pretty heavy.
WILLOW: It's Oofdar, Goddess of Childbirth. Got some nice heft to her.
BUFFY: How badly did you hurt him?
GILES: Well, hurt… maybe not hurt…
WILLOW: (helpful) I'm sure he was startled.
GILES: Yes, yes, I imagine it gave him rather a turn.
BUFFY: He ran away, right?
GILES: Sort of, more… turned and swept out majestically, I suppose. Said I didn't concern him.
BUFFY: So a mythic triumph over a  completely indifferent foe?
GILES: Well, I'm not dead or unconscious, so I say bravo for me.
WILLOW: Good demons in this one. See if your guy's in there.
XANDER: So you bought the magic shop and you were attacked before it even opened. Who's up for a swingin' chorus of the "We Told You So" symphony?
RILEY: Owning this place does seem kind of dangerous.
GILES: Toth.
RILEY: What?
BUFFY: He called you a toth. It's a British expression. It means, like, a moron.
GILES: (Patiently) No. Toth is the name of the demon. (consulting book) Ancient demon… very strong… last  survivor of the Tothic Clan. It also says that for a demon he's unusually sophisticated.
BUFFY: Sophisticated? I talk men's fashion  with him while I cut his head off?
GILES: They're referring to the fact that he  does not fight barehanded. He uses tools,  devices. He's also supposed to be very focused. An since he mentioned "The Slayer" I think we know what the focus is-
RILEY: He mentioned Buffy? Where do we find him and how hard can I kill him?
GILES: There's no mention of the types of places he might frequent. But I have an idea. He had a specific… olfactory presence.
XANDER: So it's off to the old factory. I hate that place. (off there looks) I'm joking. I know what it means. He smelled.
WILLOW: Some demon rituals involving  anointing with oils. Was it kind  of sandalwoody?
BUFFY: The city dump, where smells go to relax and be themselves.
RILEY: People say they're recycling. (sadly) They're not recycling.
WILLOW: I found a spell so you can't smell  anything. But it does it by taking  your nose off. So, no.
RILEY: What are you doing here, Spike?
SPIKE: Oh, there's a nice lady vampire  who's set up a charming tea room  just 'round the next pile of crap -- what do you think I'm doing?  I'm scavenging, ain't I?
WILLOW: Very pretty.
BUFFY: Spike, we're looking for a demon. Very tall, robe, skin kinda hanging off, deep voice…
SPIKE: What, you mean a great tall robe-y thing like that one?
TOTH: Die well, Slayer
SPIKE: Hey, big guy! Kick 'er ass!
XANDER: Watch out!
RILEY: Take cover!
SPIKE: Oh, very nice. I was on <u>your</u> side!
BUFFY: Xander!
RILEY: Man, you okay?
XANDER: I'm okay…I'm fine…
XANDER: (half asleep) Anya? Are you trying to use the hot plate again?
XANDER: Uh-oh.
XANDER: So, you take the bullet for the swinging  Scooby-friends and what do you get?  A pat on the head? A tasteful medal?  No! You get left for dead under a light  layer of moldy socks and banana peels!
XANDER: Anya! Ahn?!
XANDER: What - - No way! Who is … me? What am I doing in there?
XANDER: Buffy. Need Buffy
XANDER: No, it <u>ate</u> my quarter… Uh - huh. But, see, I'm having this sort of  aggressively bad day… Ohh!…. I found a quarter! I found a quarter!… Well, ma'am, for me it <u>is</u> worth getting excited about.
XANDER: Come on, Buffy.
BUFFY: They hung up.
BUFFY: Okay, the guy wants to fight with weapons, I've got it covered from A to Z. From ax to… ze other ax.
BUFFY: Relax. Another day, another demon.
RILEY: (unconvinced) Right. It'll be good.
DAWN: My friend Sharon's older brother knows a girl who died 'cause she choked on her boyfriend's tongue.
BUFFY: Go away, Dawn.
DAWN: I'm not in your room. I'm in the hallway. The hallway doesn't belong to you.
BUFFY: Get out of here!
DAWN: Mom, I can stand in the hallway, right?
BUFFY: She's watching us like a big freak.
JOYCE: This must be my two-teenage-daughters- in-the-house headache. I thought it felt familiar.
BUFFY: Good work, Dawn. You gave her a headache.
DAWN: I did not. Did I give you a headache, Mom? I'm sure part of it is Buffy's.
BUFFY: But part of it is Dawn's.
JOYCE: (small smile) It's so nice you've learned to share. Now, you girls solve this yourselves. It's good for you.
DAWN: She didn't say I couldn't stand here.
BUFFY: I guess I should go. I'm thinking maybe the guy actually likes smelly places. So I'm going to do a whole tour  de funky, starting with the sewers.
RILEY: I'm coming with you.
BUFFY: Um….
RILEY: I never told you this about me, but I love the sewers. Probably get a  place there when I retire.
BUFFY: Riley, this Toth guy walks softly and  carries a big blasty rod. He almost hurt  Xander - I'm not going to let him hurt you.
RILEY: I don't know. I don't like you facing off alone with these creeps who come  gunning for you. I mean, first it was Dracula-
BUFFY: Dracula wasn't the first guy to come Buffy Hunting. Lots of baddies want the slayer trophy kill. I can handle it.
RILEY: I know... And if you want me to stay out of it, that's cool. But you can't blame me for worrying. Your job makes you a target. I mean, who knows how many bad guys are out there just waiting for their chance.
SPIKE: Very posh.
SPIKE: Oh, Slayer. One of these days.
FOREMAN: Harris!
FOREMAN: Harris!
DOUBLE: Harris. Sorry. Yeah?
FOREMAN: In my trailer, okay? I'm talking to all the guys today. Job's winding down.
DOUBLE: Yeah. Right with you.
XANDER: Welcome to payback, mister evil-plan face-stealer. You take my life, you get my being-fired absolutely free!
WORKER: Harris? Where's your hardhat?
FOREMAN: Sit down.
FOREMAN: How long you work here, Harris?
DOUBLE: Huh. I'm not sure.
FOREMAN: Three months?
DOUBLE: I guess-- yes.
FOREMAN: And you haven't done much construction before this, is that right?
XANDER: I knew they were gonna notice that...
FOREMAN: I gotta tell you that's surprising, 'cause your work's been first rate. We've got another job lined up in Carleton when we finish here. You ever think about staying on full time?
XANDER: What? Why isn't he firing me-- him?
FOREMAN: I was thinking I'd have you head up the interior carpentry crew. See how it goes. It's more responsibility,  but the pay is better.
DOUBLE: (pleased) That would be great.
XANDER: A promotion?! But he... I mean, I didn't - Doesn't he see the shiny thing?!
FOREMAN: Good. Congratulations Harris. You and your girl should go out and celebrate.
DOUBLE: I already have an idea how.
MANAGER: I was going to call you, Mr. Harris. Let you know your credit checked out fine. But I really didn't think you'd be back.
XANDER: 'Mr. Harris'? Yeah, right.
MANAGER: I'm sure you'll like the building.
MANAGER: I think someone said you're currently in your parents' basement?
DOUBLE: Right. And there's just a point where you either move on or you just buy yourself a Klingon costume and go with it.
MANAGER: Well, I hope you'll be happy here, Mr. Harris. We're certainly happy to have you. (moving closer) And if you need anything, day or night, please call me. I... um... I'm leaving my home number here...
DOUBLE: Thank you.
MANAGER: Call me. Even, you know, for non-business stuff... we could maybe do something...
XANDER: She's coming on to me! Him! Please lady, that is so not me! He's too clean for one thing and his socks are all matchy and-
MANAGER: (calling back in) Remember... any time!
DOUBLE: Anya? You there? (then) Look, I know you're still mad. But I figure you're probably sitting there, pretending you're not home, but listening anyway...
ANYA: (to machine) Am not.
XANDER: Yaaaa!
XANDER: I won't let you do this! You can't do this to me!
XANDER: Oh man. I need Buffy.
DOUBLE: It stole my face. We have to fine it and we have to kill it!
XANDER: She sees it's not me. (prayer) C'mon Buffy... resist his spell... do this for me.
XANDER: Stupid dorms, all sitting there, being all the same looking. Where are you, Willow?
XANDER: (yells) Willow!
XANDER: Willow!
XANDER: Don't be scared, Will. Just listen. It's me, Xander. And I can prove it.
WILLOW: Um... okay.
XANDER: Let's see... stuff only you and me know. Okay, for my seventh birthday I wanted  a toy fire truck and I didn't get it and you were really nice about it and then the house next door burned down and real fire trucks came and for years I thought you set the fire for me. And if you did, you can tell me. (beat) And for a while last year I thought I was  lactose intolerant but it was just some bad brie. And, by the way, if I had time to prepare, I'd have way better material than this. (beat) Oh! Every Christmas we watch Charlie Brown together and I do the Snoopy dance!
WILLOW: Are you just going to keep going?
XANDER: Yes!! Yes! I will keep going until I have you convinced!
WILLOW: Xander, stop dancing!
XANDER: A-<u>ha</u>! You called me Xander!
WILLOW: Xander, shut up. Why wouldn't I think you were Xander?
XANDER: Oh. Huh.
WILLOW: What's going on?
XANDER: Okay. I woke up in the dump this morning--
WILLOW: The basement isn't a dump. (trying) It's more like a really nice... hovel.
XANDER: No. The dump. The city dump. Got hit last night. Fell down boom. Woke up in the morning.
WILLOW: Nuh-uh. We walked you home last night, remember?
XANDER: (scared) You walked... Will, did I do anything weird? Did I wave any shiny things around?
WILLOW: Shiny things? What are you talking about?
XANDER: Last night. That wasn't me. There's a double out there. Some... thing that's stolen my face. It's going around pretending it's me and it's hypnotizing people. It even got to Buffy and Giles and Riley. It's with them right now and they have no idea.
GILES: What's intriguing is that there are any number of demons with the ability to mimic a simple form, but this sounds like more than that--
DOUBLE: Hold up. Do we really have to figure out what it is? Let's just go kill it.
RILEY: Yeah. When the imposter is killed, the body'll probably turn back into whatever it really is, and then we'll know.
BUFFY: (interrupting) Toth. The demon with the creepy-stick.
DOUBLE: Toth
BUFFY: It's gotta be. He hit you with the blast and somehow that allowed him to take your form. Giles, couldn't that be what the stick-thing did?
GILES: I suppose... yes, it makes sense. A shape-shifting device.
DOUBLE: (carefully) It does make sense. It must be Toth.
XANDER: It's a robot! An evil robot constructed from evil parts that look like me and are designed to do evil!
WILLOW: Uh-huh. Or, it's Toth.
XANDER: <u>Or</u>, it's <u>Toth</u>!
BUFFY: Well, I was looking for Toth anyway. I guess now I start, you know, looking for <u>you</u>.
DOUBLE: Should I go with you? I told Anya to meet me. I'd feel a lot better knowing she's safe from this creep.
BUFFY: Go be with her. If you were running around looking for the double too... well, let's just say I don't want to run into you and kill the wrong one.
DOUBLE: Good thinking. When you kill the guy you'd better make sure you've got the one who's actually-
XANDER: A demon. A demon has taken my life from me. And he's living it better than I do.
WILLOW: But we're working on it. There's go to be a way to get to Buffy, to un-hypnotize her. I'll find a spell to snap her out of it.
XANDER: (numbly) Right. Whatever.
WILLOW: Xander, you sound a little-- You have to help me figure this out, you know.
XANDER: But I <u>never</u> help. I get in trouble and Buffy saves me.
WILLOW: That's not true! Sometimes we all work together to save you! (trying to fix it) And sometimes you're not in trouble.
XANDER: (tired) I'm just... another great humiliation. And this time it's even worse. This demon, he's like,  taking my life and, everyone's treating him... everyone's treating him like a grown-up. Well, I'm starting to feel like...
WILLOW: Like what?
XANDER: Like, it's doing everything better, it's smarter and... I don't know. Maybe I should just let it have it. Take my life, please.
WILLOW: Xander, no! You're just tired and all soggy,  that's why it seems so hard. But you can't let him take your whole existence!
XANDER: Why not? It's not like I was doing anything  so great with it. When I get to the pearly gates, I don't think the guy's going to go - "What a kick ass comic book collection, come on it!" (then) What have I got that's even worth...
XANDER: Anya.
WILLOW: You think he's after her?
XANDER: She won't know, he can just... (rallying) No. No way. He can take anything he wants, but not her. I need her.
WILLOW: (wrinkling her nose) Really?
XANDER: He could be with her now...
XANDER: Figure out a spell. Something revealy. I gotta find her.
WILLOW: Xander, you already knew he was taking over your life. You didn't think about Anya 'til just now?
XANDER: Hey, wait 'til you have an evil twin, see how <u>you</u> handle it!
WILLOW: (to herself, meekly defensive) I handled it fine.
XANDER: Anya? Ahn?
XANDER: Gotta be here. Where is it?
ANYA: You're lying. It's a trick.
DOUBLE: No. Trust me.
ANYA: You really got this apartment?
DOUBLE: I really did. And you know why?
ANYA: The ceiling fans? They're very attractive.
DOUBLE: No. It's because I knew you wanted it. It's all for you.
DOUBLE: Anya? You didn't see me today, did you? I mean, we didn't talk?
ANYA: What do you mean? I got your phone message, that's all.
DOUBLE: Good
ANYA: So what happens next?
DOUBLE: Well, at some point we take our clothes off.
ANYA: I mean, what's next in our lives? When do we get a car?
DOUBLE: A car?
ANYA: And a boat. No, wait. I don't mean a boat. I mean a puppy. Or a child? I have a list somewhere.
DOUBLE: What are you talking about?
ANYA: Just, we have to get going. I don't have time to just <u>let</u> these things happen.
DOUBLE: There's no hurry.
ANYA: Yes, there is. There's a hurry Xander. I'm dying. (beat) I may have as few as fifty years left.
DOUBLE: Fifty-years-- what is this... oh, wait a minute. This is about this.
ANYA: What? About the sling?
DOUBLE: You haven't been hurt like this since you became human. Maybe it's finally hitting you what being human means.
ANYA: That's not it.
DOUBLE: Yes, I think it is. You were going to live for thousands more years. Now you're going to  age and... die. It must be terrifying.
ANYA: You don't understand what it's like.
DOUBLE: Being suddenly human? I think I can get what that would be like. And, I think that we can work through it.
ANYA: You can't make it any different. I'm going to get old and you can't promise you'll be with me when I'm wrinkly and my teeth are artificial and stuck into my wrinkly mouth with an adhesive.
DOUBLE: I can't promise that. But it doesn't sound terrible, and that's saying something.
DOUBLE: I promise you, Anya, very soon you won't be thinking anymore about getting older...
XANDER: Get away from her!
ANYA: Xander! Xander?
DOUBLE: Get out! You don't belong here!
XANDER: Anya! It's me!
DOUBLE: (to Anya) It's a demon. He stole my face. He's trying to trick you.
DOUBLE: Anya... you know I'm me, right?
XANDER: No!
ANYA: (to Xander-Double, re Xander) What is it? Make him go away!
RILEY: So you're thinking we split up.
BUFFY: Right. You hit all the places he might go to blend in as Xander. I'll keep checking out the places Toth might hang--
GILES: I swear, that time I <u>know</u> I had that locked.
WILLOW: Buffy! Toth looks like Xander!
RILEY: We know it already. We're on our way--
BUFFY: Wait. Willow, how do you know about this.
WILLOW: He came to me. I mean, Xander did. He's in terrible shape. We need to help him!
RILEY: He came to us, too.
WILLOW: No! We each had a Xander. I mean you  didn't have a Xander! You had a demon in a Xander-suit!
BUFFY: But, wait, what make you think yours was the right one?
WILLOW: He knew stuff. He did the Snoopy dance. Buffy, it was Xander and he needs us!
GILES: Oh dear lord.
RILEY: Buffy... Our Xander. Did he seem a little...
BUFFY: He was kind of... forceful and confident.
WILLOW: That's not Xander!
GILES: I said <u>oh dear lord</u>.
BUFFY: You always say that.
GILES: Well, it's always important! Neither one of the Xanders is a demon.
WILLOW: Um... is one of them a robot?
GILES: What? No. The rod device, it's called a  Ferula-gemina. It splits one person into half, distilling personality traits into two separate bodies. As near as I can tell Toth was attempting to split the Slayer into two different entities.
RILEY: Two Buffys?
GILES: Yes, one of them with all the qualities inherent in Buffy Summers. The other with everything that belongs to the  Slayer alone: the strength and speed, the heritage. When it hit Xander, I think it separated him into his strongest  qualities and his... weakest.
RILEY: But which one is the real one?
GILES: They're <u>both</u> real. They're both Xander. Neither of them is evil. There's nothing in either of them that <u>our</u> Xander didn't already posses.
RILEY: I still don't get the original plan. Why do it? The Slayer half would be like Slayer-concentrate. Pretty unkillable.
GILES: But the two halves can't exist without the other. Kill the weaker Buffy half and the Slayer half dies.
BUFFY: So, same thing for the Xanders, right? Both of them need to stay alive or they both die.
XANDER: <u>He's</u> the demon! Or possibly a robot! Look at me Anya! Look in my eyes! Can't you see it's me?
ANYA: I don't know.
XANDER: (desperate) Please! Look at him! Listen to him! He's all smooth! You have to know me!
DOUBLE: Don't worry Anya. I'll get rid of this <u>thing</u>. (to Xander) I'm thinking this is gonna last about fifteen seconds.
XANDER: I'm thinking less.
ANYA: No! Don't shoot him!
BUFFY: Can't this thing go any faster? Ultimate Driving Machine my ass.
RILEY: We're pushing seventy.
BUFFY: Hey, Riley. Do you wish --
RILEY: No.
BUFFY: No? You don't even know what I was going to say!
RILEY: Yes, I do. You wanted to know if I wished you got hit by the Ferula-gemina. Got split in two.
BUFFY: Well, you have been kinda rankly about the whole "Slayer" gig. Instead of Slayer Buffy you could have Buffy Buffy.
RILEY: I have Buffy Buffy. Being the slayer is part of who you are. You keep thinking I don't get that, but --
BUFFY: I just know how unfun it can be. Bad hours, frequent bruising, cranky monsters-
RILEY: Buffy, if you led a perfectly normal life, you wouldn't be half as crazy as you are. I gotta have that. I'm talking toes, elbows, the whole bad-ice-skating-movie obsession, everything. There's no part of you I'm not in love with.
BUFFY: We better get there soon. If Xander kills himself, he's dead. (thinks) You know what I mean.
XANDER: (to Anya) Let go! I have to kill the demon-bot!
DOUBLE: Anya, get out of the way.
BUFFY: Xander!
DOUBLE: It's all right Buffy, I have him.
XANDER: No! Buffy! I'm me! Help me!
ANYA: That's my gun! He has my gun!
RILEY: You own a gun?
BUFFY: Xander-- Gun-holding Xander. Give it to me.
ANYA: Buffy! Which one's real?
XANDER: I am!
DOUBLE: No. I am.
XANDER: Ow!
DOUBLE: Thank you!
DOUBLE: Ow!
RILEY: Wild.
BUFFY: Yeah. Okay, look, Xander...s. You've been split in two. You're both Xander. And you can't kill each other. I mean you <u>can</u>, but it would be bad.
DOUBLE: No way.
XANDER: He <u>can't</u> be me. He's all... fancy.
RILEY: We can prove you're both Xander.
BUFFY: Yes! How?
RILEY: (stumped) Well, there has to be a way.
BUFFY: What number am I thinking of?
RILEY: I don't think that's how to--
DOUBLE: Eleven and a half.
BUFFY: Wrong. Oh! But, see?!
XANDER: No. We're not the same. We're all different.
RILEY: Different properties went into each of you, but you're both Xander.
ANYA: Different properties?
XANDER: What different properties?
BUFFY: (covering) Oh... um... sense of direction, good night-vision, stuff like that.
XANDER: But he has a thing! In his pocket! A shiny disk that stuns and disorients!
DOUBLE: What disk? This?
XANDER: Cover your eyes! It'll melt your brain!
BUFFY: Look.
DOUBLE: It's a nickel someone flattened on a railroad track. I found it on the construction site and I thought it was cool. It's not magic.
XANDER: No! It-- Huh. It is kinda cool. Washington's still there, but he's all smooshy. And he  may be Jefferson.
ANYA: Isn't anyone going to tell me why there are two Xanders?
BUFFY: We'll explain on the way to Giles--
TOTH: I will not miss again, Slayer.
BUFFY: Oh great. Rod boy.
XANDER: The gun! Pick up the little gun-pieces!
DOUBLE: Hey! I just made a small cleaning deposit!
BUFFY: Sword!
DOUBLE: Oh yeah, that cleaning deposit's gone.
XANDER: I was thinking the same thought. (a brand new thought for him) Hey-- do you suppose we're <u>both</u> Xander?
XANDER: (jovial) Look and admire, ladies.
BUFFY: It's like... there's a little scar here, then there it is over there.
WILLOW: It's all doubled. This zit, and this kind of funny dippy place and this weird little hair that grows the wrong way--
XANDER: (same jovial tone) Okay, back off, ladies.
RILEY: Psychologically, this is fascinating. Doesn't it make everyone want to lock them in separate rooms and do experiments on them? (then) Just me, then.
ANYA: So, you Xanders, you really do have all the same memories, <u>all</u> the same... physical... attributes?
DOUBLE: We're completely identical.
XANDER: Yeah, we checked over some stuff in the car on the way over. (quickly) Fingerprints.
ANYA: Maybe we shouldn't do this reintegration thing right away. See, I could take the boys home, have sex with all of us, then we could just slap ‘em back together in the morning.
DOUBLE: (smoothly to the others) She's joking.
XANDER: No she's <u>not</u>! She entirely wants to have sex with us together! It's wrong, and, and... it would be very confusing!
GILES: Now, we need to arrange the candles. Also, we can continue to pretend we heard none of this disturbing sex talk.
WILLOW: Check. Candles and pretense.
ANYA: (to herself) It's not like it'd be cheating. They're both Xander.
XANDER: Now, hold on a sec. If you weren't putting the whammy on people with the shiny thing? How did you do it? How'd you get the promotion?
DOUBLE: Well I'm good at that stuff.
XANDER: I am?
DOUBLE: Yeah.
XANDER: (smiling) Hey, how about that girl, the apartment manager?
DOUBLE: How weird was it when she called me ‘Mr.'?
WILLOW: We're ready. We should do it now.
ANYA: What do we do if it doesn't work?
DOUBLE: Kill us both, Spock!
BUFFY: (aside, to Giles) They're kind of... the same now.
GILES: Yes. He's clearly a bad influence on himself.
XANDER: (to Willow) Summon the goddess, chant the chant. Let's do it.
WILLOW: Actually, it's not that hard. See, your natural state is to be together. Toth's spell is doing all the work of keeping you apart. I just have to break it. You two stand here. Side by side. Don't want you to end up with two fronts, do we?
XANDER: You sure you know how to do this?
WILLOW: Here we go. Brace yourselves. "Let the spell be ended."
XANDER: You've got to be kidding. "Let the spell be ended"? That's not gonna work! Oh.
ANYA: I liked it the other way. Put ‘em back.
BUFFY: You look good, Xand. Clothes, hair... I think you came out ahead in this whole thing.
XANDER: Will, I got a job and an apartment. If the hair's grooving along with the new vibe, I'm okay with it.
BUFFY: I guess maybe we shoulda kept both of you ‘til we had all the heavy lifting done, huh?
XANDER: Yeah. But, really... it was too weird. And my... Um... less cool half... a sweetheart of a guy, but still, just on the clumsiness issue alone, I don't think anyone would've wanted him around much.
DAWN: (wistfully to herself) I would've wanted him.
RILEY: Getting nostalgic?
XANDER: I don't know. At first it's just a place, and then you start to make memories and then it's like... that's where Spike slept, and there... that's where Anya and I drowned the Separvo demon and right here, here's where my heart got all ripped out... I really hate this place.
BUFFY: Hey, Anya, I see you've joined the  not-sling-wearing crowd.
ANYA: Yes. I'm feeling better and I anticipate many years before my death, excepting  disease or air bag failure.
BUFFY: Ah. That sounds... good?
ANYA: Oooh, a present!
XANDER: Not unless you want my collection of Babylon 5 commemorative plates. (beat) Which you cannot have. I just thought you could help carry a little.
ANYA: Me? Buffy has super strength, let's just load her up like one of those little horses.
XANDER: Anya. Please.
ANYA: Fine. I'm just your slave.
XANDER: How is it that she can always make me feel like Suave Xander has left the building?
RILEY: You two have your friction, but she digs the  whole package. It's obvious.
XANDER: Still, I do envy you sometimes. I mean, for the sanity. Not that I'm still into Buffy. Not that I ever was.
RILEY: Hey, I'm well aware of how lucky I am. Like, <u>lottery</u> lucky. Buffy's like nobody  else in the world. When I'm with her, it's like <u>I'm</u> split in two -- half of me is just on fire, going crazy if I'm not touching her. Other half is so still and peaceful, just perfectly content. Just knows: this is the one.
RILEY: But she doesn't love me.
BUFFY: (to Riley) You got more for me to carry?
RILEY: You can help me pack this.
BUFFY: Sure.
