(to Xander) If you get the apartment, this'll be your hallway, We'll walk down this hall going, la, la, I'm on my way to Xander's.
Ooh. Big.
But we're quite and clean.
Very, you know, kind of Old south.
It's Oofdar, Goddess of Childbirth. Got some nice heft to her.
(helpful) I'm sure he was startled.
Good demons in this one. See if your guy's in there.
Some demon rituals involving  anointing with oils. Was it kind  of sandalwoody?
I found a spell so you can't smell  anything. But it does it by taking  your nose off. So, no.
Very pretty.
Um... okay.
Are you just going to keep going?
Xander, stop dancing!
Xander, shut up. Why wouldn't I think you were Xander?
What's going on?
The basement isn't a dump. (trying) It's more like a really nice... hovel.
Nuh-uh. We walked you home last night, remember?
Shiny things? What are you talking about?
Uh-huh. Or, it's Toth.
But we're working on it. There's go to be a way to get to Buffy, to un-hypnotize her. I'll find a spell to snap her out of it.
Xander, you sound a little-- You have to help me figure this out, you know.
That's not true! Sometimes we all work together to save you! (trying to fix it) And sometimes you're not in trouble.
Like what?
Xander, no! You're just tired and all soggy,  that's why it seems so hard. But you can't let him take your whole existence!
You think he's after her?
(wrinkling her nose) Really?
Xander, you already knew he was taking over your life. You didn't think about Anya 'til just now?
(to herself, meekly defensive) I handled it fine.
Buffy! Toth looks like Xander!
He came to me. I mean, Xander did. He's in terrible shape. We need to help him!
No! We each had a Xander. I mean you  didn't have a Xander! You had a demon in a Xander-suit!
He knew stuff. He did the Snoopy dance. Buffy, it was Xander and he needs us!
That's not Xander!
Um... is one of them a robot?
It's all doubled. This zit, and this kind of funny dippy place and this weird little hair that grows the wrong way--
Check. Candles and pretense.
We're ready. We should do it now.
Actually, it's not that hard. See, your natural state is to be together. Toth's spell is doing all the work of keeping you apart. I just have to break it. You two stand here. Side by side. Don't want you to end up with two fronts, do we?
Here we go. Brace yourselves. "Let the spell be ended."
