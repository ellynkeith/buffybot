VAMPIRE: Gave me a pretty good run there.  Bet the blood's just pumpin'... Bet it's hot.
TEEN: Don't hurt me...
VAMPIRE: Don't hurt you? I'm gonna rip your  throat out and suck on your arteries  like they was soda pop straws. I don't  get how 'don't hurt me' works into that  scenario.
BUFFY: Hey. What's going on.
TEEN: Help me! Call the police!
VAMPIRE: Get out of here, girl.
BUFFY: Are you guys havin' a fight? 'Cause, you know, fighting's not cool.
TEEN: Get out of here!
VAMPIRE: No, no, she wants to stay... (turns his attention to her) ... I don't mind a little appetizer...
BUFFY: Have you ever heard the expression, "biting off more than you can chew?"
VAMPIRE: What the Hell are you talking about?
BUFFY: Wow. Never heard that one. Okay, how about, "Oh God, my leg, my leg?"
VAMPIRE: Oh God, my leg! Ah, God!
BUFFY: See -- now we're communicating.
TEEN: How did you...do that?
BUFFY: It's what I do.
TEEN: But... you're just a girl ...
BUFFY: That's what <b>I</b> keep saying.
XANDER: Something going on out back?
BUFFY: Vampire.
XANDER: Oh.
BUFFY: (to Giles) Anything?
GILES: Nothing you want to hear. The ritual is...
BUFFY: Explain it to me again.
GILES: There's nothing new to --
BUFFY: (calm and slow) Go through it again.
GILES: The Key was living energy. It needed  to be channeled, poured into a specific  spot at a specific time. With all attendant  ritual, of course. The energy would flow  into that spot, the walls between the  dimensions break down. It stops -- the  energy is used up -and the walls come back  up. Glory uses that time to get back to her  dimension, not caring that all manner of hell  will be unleashed on Earth in the meantime.
ANYA: But only for a little while, right? The walls come back, no more hell?
WILLOW: But that's only if the energy is stopped.  And now that the Key is human ... is Dawn ...
GILES: "The blood flows, the gates will open.  The gates will close when it flows no  more." When Dawn is dead.
TARA: I have places to be!
XANDER: Why blood? Why is it Dawn's blood,  why couldn't it be, like, a lymph ritual?
SPIKE: 'Cause it's always gotta be blood.
XANDER: We're not actually discussing dinner right now.
SPIKE: Blood is life, lackbrain. Why do you think  we eat it? It's what keeps you going, makes  you warm, makes you hard, makes you  other than dead. 'Course it's her blood.
BUFFY: Pretty simple math, here. We stop  Glory before she can start the ritual.  There's still a couple of hours, right?
GILES: If my calculations are right, but Buffy --
BUFFY: I don't want to hear it --
GILES: I understand that --
BUFFY: No you don't understand! We're not talking about this!
GILES: (standing) Yes we bloody well are!
BUFFY: Say it. Come on, we're bloody well  talking about this, tell me to kill my sister!
GILES: (quietly) She's not your sister.
BUFFY: No. She's not. She's more than that.  (trying to articulate it... ) More than family... my sister, my daughter...
XANDER: She's your sister and your daughter?
BUFFY: She's me. The Monks made her out of me. I hold her and I feel closer to her than... It's more than just the memories  they built, it's physical, it's... Dawn is a  part of me. The only part that I...
WILLOW: We'll solve this. We will. Don't have another coma, okay?
GILES: Buffy, if the ritual starts, every living  creature in this and every other dimension  imaginable will suffer unbearable torment  and Death. Including Dawn.
BUFFY: Then the last thing she'll see is me protecting her.
GILES: You'll fail. You'll die. We all will.
BUFFY: I'm sorry. I love you all, but I'm sorry.
ANYA: (raising hand) Okay, all in favor of Stopping Glory BEFORE the ritual! Suggestions? Ideas? Time's a-wastin' ...
SPIKE: (to Buffy) When you say you love us <b>all</b>--
GILES: Shut up.
ANYA: Willow! I bet you've got some dark  spell a'brewin'. You make her a toad,  little hoppy toad, we hit her with a hammer...
TARA: (laughing) Hoppy toad ...
XANDER: What about Ben? He can be killed,  right? I mean, I know he's an innocent,  but, you know, not, like "Dawn" innocent.  We could kill... a regular guy... (no we couldn't) God.
GILES: It's ' doubtful he'll surface again this  close to the ritual. We have to expect  it's Glory we're dealing with.
ANYA: (panicking) Well somebody come up with something!
XANDER: Should we join essences and become superslayer again?
BUFFY: That worked against Frankenbot, but  to kill a true god... I don't think it's  enough. And I need you guys conscious ...
WILLOW: But we don't have to kill her, just stop  her from performing the ritual. I mean,  there's just the one time she can do it, right?
SPIKE: Yeah, we get her on the ropes, we just  gotta keep her occupied till it's too late!
ANYA: Okay, but I'm still not hearing enough ideas,  she's a god, let's think outside the box!
SPIKE: Why don't you go think outside the bleedin' box?
GILES: Yes, Anya, apart from your incredibly  uninfectious enthusiasm, have you  anything to contribute? Any ideas on  how to fight a god? Love to hear 'em.
XANDER: How about we don't pick on my gi--
ANYA: The Dagon's Sphere!
GILES: Sorry?
ANYA: When Buffy first met Glory she found  that magical glowy sphere that was  meant to repel Glory. We've got it in  the basement. It might drive her back,  or hurt her... oh! And -- (presenting, as on a game show)  --Olaf the Trollgod's enchanted hammer.  You wanna fight a god, use the weapon  of a god.
SPIKE: Nah, that thing's too heavy to --
BUFFY: I like this.
ANYA: Built for squashin'!
BUFFY: Good heft to it. I just might do some  damage with this. (to Anya) Thanks.
ANYA: Here to help. Want to live.
GILES: Anya, that's all very -- did you just think of all that just now?
XANDER: (looking at Anya) Smart chicks are so hot.
WILLOW: You couldn't have figured that out in tenth grade...?
XANDER: You know me and timing ...
GILES: Well. We have some ideas. And a  little time to come up with some more.  Could give Glory a decent run, but ...
BUFFY: But we still have no idea how to find her.
TARA: Big day... it calls out and... I have to be there.
BEN: They, uh... said you have to put this on. For the ceremony.
DAWN: What if I don't?
BEN: Come on, just --
DAWN: What if I don't like the color? It's a winter -- I'm not a winter.
BEN: I guess they didn't take that into account.  Look, I... I wish there was another way.
DAWN: And I wish you'd fall on your head and  drown in your own barf, so I guess we're  both having frowny days.
BEN: I think... it'll be quick.
BEN: <b>Thank you</b>. For the information. (to Dawn) I'll do what I can to --
DAWN: Change.
BEN: What?
DAWN: Change. Be her. Be Glory.
BEN: Dawn, I don't think you wanna --
DAWN: <b>Be Glory</b>! I don't wanna look at you! Glory! <b>GLORY! <u>GLORY!</u></b>
BEN: Will you just stop --
GLORY: --shouting already? Jeez! I can't hear  myself think about killing you. What's  the hubbub, bub? What do you got  against old Benjy?
DAWN: He's a monster. At least you're up front about it.
GLORY: Don't be so hard on the boy. He just wants  to live -- most guys'd do the same. 'Sides,  he's probably the reason your sis and her  little cartoon pals are still alive. That  little nagging pinch of humanity that  makes me go for the hurt instead of the  kill. Lowering myself to trade blows  with a Slayer when I should have just  put my fist through her heart. That's gotta be Ben.
DAWN: Or maybe you just can't take her.
GLORY: Funny thing... you've been here for  a few hours now and I haven't seen  big sis galloping in to save you. She  probably knows what a terrible mistake  that'd be.
DAWN: She's not afraid of you.
GLORY: Oh, no, sweetie baby, I'm talking about  the ritual. 'Cause you know, I bleed  you, the portals open, but once you die,  they close. The faster you die, the better  for your sorry species. I'm bettin' Buffy  knows that. And since your not really  her <b>sister</b>--
DAWN: (barely audible) Buffy... please help me ...
GILES: You sure you're not going to  tire yourself out?
BUFFY: I'm sure.
GILES: We're still working on ideas. Time's  short, but it's best to wait 'til the last  minute. If we go in too early and  she takes us out, no chance of getting  her to miss her window.
BUFFY: So we wait.
GILES: I imagine you hate me right now.
BUFFY: Little bit. But I understand.
GILES: I love Dawn.
BUFFY: I know.
GILES: But I have sworn to protect this sorry  world, and sometimes that means  saying and doing... what other people  can't. What they shouldn't have to.
BUFFY: You try to hurt her, you know I'll stop you.
GILES: I know.
BUFFY: How many apocalypses is this for us?
GILES: Well, six, at least. Seems like a hundred. 
BUFFY: I've always stopped them. Always won.
GILES: Yes.
BUFFY: I sacrificed Angel to save the world.  I loved him so much... but I knew.  What was right. I don't have that  any more. I don't understand. I don't know how to live in this world,  if these are the choices, if everything's  just stripped away then I don't see  the point. I just wish... I wish my  mom was here.
GILES: I think you're wrong about that.
BUFFY: It doesn't matter. If Dawn dies, then I'm done with it. I'm quitting.
GLORY: Okay, campers! It's almost stab time! You two, get her.
DAWN: BUFFY!
GLORY: Hey hey HEY! Again with the screaming,  you know you could scare bats away  with that screech of yours. We're not doing  it here. All this time together, you think  I have no sense of style? Portal's up there. (gestures above) You're going out, but you're going out  with a view. (to the minions) Take her. (as they go) See you in a few.
GILES: No luck finding the sphere?
XANDER: (calling up) Yeah, we're on it... let's look over here! Where we didn't look yet!
GILES: Well, time's a factor...
ANYA: Yes, yes! Not to worry.
XANDER: So, are you any more relaxed?
ANYA: No.
XANDER: No? I mean, it sounded like you... arrived. 
ANYA: No, yes, I had the pleasure moment,  and the blissful calm that comes right  after it, but that only lasted a couple  of seconds and now I'm terrified again.
XANDER: You don't have to be.
ANYA: Gaaah! What?
XANDER: Spike's sexbot.. Why didn't they melt this thing into scrap?
ANYA: Maybe Willow wanted it.
XANDER: (uncomfortable) I don't think Willow feels that way  about Buffy... I mean she's gone  through a lot of changes, but --
ANYA: To study it.
XANDER: Right. Robotics. Science.
ANYA: Pervert.
XANDER: Other pervert.
ANYA: And don't frighten me like thaAAAHHH!
XANDER: Hey, shhhhh ...
ANYA: It's an omen, it's a higher power  trying to tell me through bunnies  that we're all gonna die! Oh, God...
XANDER: No it's not. It's okay.
ANYA: No, you see, usually, when there's an  apocalypse, I skedaddle. But now I  love you so much that instead I have  inappropriately timed sex and try to  think of ways to fight a god and worry  terribly that something might happen  to you, and also worry that something'll  happen to me and then I have guilt that  I'm not more worried about everyone  else but I just don't have enough, I'm  just on total overload and I honestly  don't think anything could make me  more nervous than I am right now.
XANDER: Care to wager on that?
ANYA: You're proposing to me!
XANDER: Yes ...
ANYA: You're proposing to me 'cause we're  gonna die! And, and, you think it's  romantic and sexy and you know  you're not gonna have to go through  with it, cause the world's gonna end!
XANDER: I'm proposing to you, Anya, because it's not.
ANYA: You can't know that.
XANDER: I believe it. I think we're gonna get  through this. I think I'm gonna live  a long and silly life and I'm not  interested in doing that without  you around.
ANYA: Oh.
XANDER: Okay?
ANYA: Yes. I mean yes.
XANDER: No?
ANYA: After. Give it to me when the world doesn't end.
XANDER: Buffy. She'll find a way. Figure out what's gotta be done.
ANYA: She did say she'd let everybody die.
XANDER: I've known her for five years, she  doesn't back down, she doesn't fail.  You see me doing anything remotely  heroical, that's something I learned  from her.
BUFFY: You got anything for me?
WILLOW: Some ideas -- well, notions, or theories,  based on wild speculation. Did I  mention I'm not good under pressure?
BUFFY: I need you, Will. You're my big gun.
WILLOW: I'm your -- I never was a gun... someone  else should be the gun, I could maybe  be a cudgel, or pointy stick ...
BUFFY: Willow, you're the strongest person here. You know that.
WILLOW: Well, no ...
BUFFY: You're the only one who's ever hurt  Glory. At all. You're my best shot at  getting her on the ropes so don't get a  jelly belly now. What about those  spells you used on her before?
WILLOW: They only worked for a few minutes.  Plus she knows about 'em -- she might  have protection, some counter-mojo  set up. I mean, she's gotta know  we're coming.
BUFFY: So...
WILLOW: Well, I do sort of have one idea, but… last few days I've mostly been looking  into ways to help Tara. I know that  shouldn't be my priority --
BUFFY: Of course it should.
WILLOW: I've been charting their essences, mapping  out ... I think... If I can get close enough,  I may be able to reverse what Glory did.  Kind of take back what she took from  Tara. It might weaken Glory, or make  her less coherent, or make all our heads  explode -- I'm still working out the details.
BUFFY: I don't like the exploding heads. The rest sounds solid.
WILLOW: I'll try to work it.
GILES: Buffy...
WILLOW: Don't worry, love. It won't be too long.
TARA: (bitterly) You can't even let it... Bitch, I'm supposed  to work on the factors... I'm not...
WILLOW: I'm gonna bring you back.
BUFFY: No, that's good. That could be pivotal. (to Xander and Anya) Thanks, guys.
GILES: Well, then you're going to need --
BUFFY: Way ahead of you. We got time?
GILES: Yes. If you hurry.
BUFFY: I'll grab some weapons, too.
XANDER: I'm looking for something in a broadsword ...
SPIKE: Don't be swinging that thing near me.
XANDER: Hey, I happen to be --
SPIKE: A glorified brick-layer?
XANDER: I'm also a swell bowler.
ANYA: Has his own shoes.
SPIKE: The Gods themselves do tremble.
BUFFY: Spike. Shut your mouth. And come with me.
BUFFY: Weapons in the chest by the TV. I'll grab the stuff upstairs --
SPIKE: Uh, Buffy ...
BUFFY: Come in, Spike.
SPIKE: Presto. No barrier.
BUFFY: We're not all gonna make it. You know that.
SPIKE: Yeah. Hey, I always knew I'd go down  fighting. Sure as hell never thought it'd  be on this side... (shyly) ...or for this reason...
BUFFY: I'm counting on you, Spike. To help protect her.
SPIKE: 'Til the end of the world -- even if  that happens to be tonight. Nobody  touches the Little Bit while Spike's  around. I promise.
BUFFY: I'll be one minute.
SPIKE: I know you'll never love me.
BUFFY: We on schedule?
GILES: Yes. It's time.
BUFFY: Willow?
WILLOW: Tara... baby... is there somewhere you should be?
TARA: They held me down ...
WILLOW: Nobody's holding you. It's the big day, right? Do you want to go?
TARA: (bitterly) You're a killer. It's all put down ...
BUFFY: Willow, stay close but don't crowd her.  We'll follow in a minute. Everyone  knows their jobs. Remember, the ritual  starts, we all die. And I'll kill anyone  who comes near Dawn.
SPIKE: Not exactly the St. Crispin's Day speech, was it?
GILES: (sardonic agreement) "We few..."
SPIKE: "we happy few…"
SPIKE: "We band of buggered..."
XANDER: ("yikes") Shpadoinkle ...
ANYA: What is that... ?
GILES: The portal must open up there.
XANDER: Hey, check that out. I think I can work with that.
BUFFY: Give it a shot.
XANDER: See you guys in there.
BUFFY: Will, you're up.
GILES: Need anything?
WILLOW: Could use some courage ...
GLORY: You. What are you doing here?
WILLOW: She's with me.
GLORY: What the frikkin' hell did that bitch do to me!?!
GLORY: She made a little, she made a hole ... God I need a meal... I need a brain to eat --
GLORY: I said a BRAIN, you worthless dirt! I got places to be! Big day... Need a brain ...
BUFFY: Okay then. Come and get it.
BUFFY: You don't seem very well. Do you need to lie down and have a tonic?
GLORY: Your little witchbitch gave me kind  of a headache there. And all it did to  her was kill her and her friend, so kudos  to her! But if you think this is gonna  last more than eight seconds...
BUFFY: I notice that you're talking, whereas in your position I would attack me.
GLORY: Guard the girl! I can take care of hairdo here. This is a... a...
GLORY: Go! Guard!
BUFFY: You keep saying I'm nothing, I'm  still not feeling attacked by you.  It's strange ...
GLORY: The witch ...
BUFFY: It's not her.
GLORY: You're gonna wish --
WILLOW: Tara? Tara!
TARA: (weakly) Willow?
WILLOW: Tara...
TARA: Willow... I got so lost ...
WILLOW: I found you.
GLORY: You know what?
BUFFY: Well that's the --
GLORY: I'm sorry, you had a comment?
BUFFY: You're not the <b>brightest</b> god in the heavens, are you?
DAWN: BUFFY! I'M UP HERE!
GLORY: Oh no you don't ...
XANDER: Beautiful... hold that pose.
GLORY: You lost your hammer, sweetcheeks. What're you gonna hit me with now.?
BUFFY: Whatever's handy ...
XANDER: And the glorified brick-layer picks up a spare ...
ANYA: Has anybody noticed that we're moving backwards?
SPIKE: It's crossed my mind ...
GILES: If Buffy can keep Glory down long  enough, it won't matter. There's only  a few minutes left to start the ritual.
DAWN: You... can you help me? Untie me ...
DOC: Oh, sweet girl, I can do magic!
DAWN: Please help me... she's coming ...
DOC: Well she seems to be running late, is  the thing. And if her splendidness isn't  here to bleed you ...
XANDER: How are we doing?
ANYA: So far, it's a tie.
GILES: We haven't gotten up to Dawn, but neither has anyone else.
SPIKE: Someone's up there.
XANDER: Okay, we gotta charge or something ...
ANYA: We tried that.
SPIKE: Loud and clear ...
GILES: Who? What?
SPIKE: Yeah. Can't see who.
XANDER: Are you talking to us?
SPIKE: Yeah. But --
DOC: What do you know? Just about that time.
DAWN: (seeing) SPIKE!
SPIKE: Doesn't a fellow stay dead when you kill 'im?
DOC: Look who's talking.
SPIKE: Come on, Doc. Let's you and me have a go.
DOC: I do have a prior appointment...
SPIKE: This won't take long.
DOC: No. I don't imagine it will.
GLORY: This isn't fair.
BUFFY: I'm sorry. You want to rip apart the  fabric of reality, destroy my world and  kill my sister and now you're introducing  the concept of fairness?
GLORY: (near tears) You're just a mortal... you couldn't understand my pain.
BUFFY: I guess I'll have to settle for causing it.
GLORY: You can't kill me ...
BUFFY: No... but my arm's not even tired.
SPIKE: You don't come near the girl, Doc.
DOC: I don't smell a soul anywhere on you... why do you even care?
SPIKE: I made a promise to a lady.
DOC: Oh.
SPIKE: No --
GLORY: Stop it...
BUFFY: You're a god ...
BEN: I'm sorry ...
BUFFY: Tell her it's over. She missed her shot.  She goes. She ever -- EVER -- comes  near me and mine again...
BEN: We won't. I swear.
GILES: Can you move?
BEN: Need... a minute… She could have killed me.
GILES: No she couldn't. Never. And sooner  or later, Glory will re-emerge and make  Buffy pay for that mercy, and the world  with her. Buffy even knows that, and  still she wouldn't take a human life.  Because she's a hero, you see.  She's not like us.
BEN: Us?
DOC: Shallow cuts, shallow cuts... let the blood flow free...
BUFFY: Dawn.
DAWN: Buffy...
DOC: Well, this should be interest--
DAWN: Buffy, it hurts ...
BUFFY: I got you... You're gonna be okay ...
DAWN: Oh, God, Buffy ....
BUFFY: Come on!
DAWN: I can't.
BUFFY: What? We have to get down!
DAWN: Buffy, it's started.
ANYA: Xander!
XANDER: Anya!
ANYA: Xander... don't stand there.
XANDER: Anya... ?
DAWN: I'm sorry ...
BUFFY: It doesn't matter. Nothing --
DAWN: I can end this.
BUFFY: No!
DAWN: I have to jump. The energy --
BUFFY: It'll kill you!
DAWN: I know. Buffy, I know about the ritual! I have to stop it.
BUFFY: No!
DAWN: I have to! Look at what's happening!
BUFFY: I don't care! Dawn, I won't lose you --
DAWN: You have to! You have to let me go!  Blood starts it, and until the blood  stops flowing it'll never stop. You  know you have to let me ...
DAWN: Buffy... no ...
BUFFY: Dawnie... I have to --
DAWN: NO!
BUFFY: Listen to me! There's no time, Dawn, please listen.
WORLD:  A LOT
