Nope.
Okay.
Maybe it's her.
Well, I get to run the store, right?
I can take care of that.
Thank you, Sweetie. Well said.
(to Xander) Well tell her I don't need her help!
Hey! What are you two doing?
Stop that!
The cash register! What did you do  with the cash register?! Dear God!
(to Willow) You endangered the money!
Xander! Don't go!
Me?!
Ten bucks for twelve. Bargain.
Oh, that's a pricey one--
Fine.
Is it done?
Sorry. Thought it was done.
No, no. I'm sure you can do that all on your own.
I believe I have said it.
I don't know how to put the top up. I only just figured out what the left pedal does. (proudly)  It makes us stop.
Well, I couldn't know if I could until  I tried, could I?  WILLOW  This is very very bad! There's an ogre on the loose and--
Troll.
It's likely. We're going very fast. (then) You should have listened to me and not done a spell. Giles left me in charge.
What do you mean by that?
Find that spell. Quickly.
But we can stop him. Willow, do the spell.
Hum.
The hammer! Watch out!
The hammer is his power.
This is a terrible mess.
The keys of your car.
In case we need 'em, I'm getting more of all the things you stole.
What?
I am a human. And there are many humans who are stranger than me.
(realizing)  You really think I would do that!
I was a demon then. I don't even have any powers now! (re: book) Is this the spell?
Why not?
Go Xander! I love you!
Don't take Xander!
Buffy!
I don't know how!
Hey! Olaf! You are as inadequate a troll as you were a boyfriend!
You are hairy and unattractive and  even women trolls are put off by your  various odors!
Hey! Good job!
Oh yeah. He still has all that troll-strength.
(to Xander) Poor baby.
Yes.
Yes. Willow likes you too, but not in a sexy way 'cuz she's gay, and she won't break us up so it's all okay.
The Land of the Trolls. He'll like it there. Full of trolls.
It's possible that he's in the Land of Perpetual Wednesday or Crazy Melty Land or the World Without Shrimp.
