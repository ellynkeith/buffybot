Yes, he did. Are you okay?
Answer me.
I know, it's just that I trust those Watchers about at far as… (noting Giles' arm rubbing) …<u>you</u> could throw them.
It's okay. You can say his name.
I'm doing all right. I mean, these  things happen. People break up, they  move on. For a while it feels like  the end of the world, but in the big picture...
You, with the actual clothing. Who are you? (calls out) Dawn! Come look at this!
No more bathrobe.
Maybe we should burn it.
(to Dawn) Come on, she's tired out.
Playing soccer.
Don't touch anything.
Yeah.
It didn't feel like that. I was never angry with him. (then) Okay, that's a lie. I was angry with him, but… not like I didn't want to see his face.
No.
I hope so. I mean, yeah. It has to. I'll just keep going on like I am,  and it'll get better. Every day  it'll be a tiny bit better.
Not really. But it'll be better soon.
It seemed very much like saliva.
Anya and Xander are in trouble?
He left? He left Anya?
Nooo!
(almost wailing) They have a... a... beautiful love!
Mmrccllvv.
A miraculous lo-- lo-- love!
Don't worry. We'll get her back. I promise. (then)  C'mon, this thing's probably leaving  a huge trail.
I'm here.
(to Willow)  You did this?
Xander, follow him. Willow and Anya, head back to the store, try to come up with a spell that'll actually stop him.
(triumphantly) So. Your power's in your hammer.
I only care that he's not here and I got a nifty new souvenir.
Oops.
(looking at Willow and Tara)  So together... and good... and alive...
I'm just so... happy for you!
