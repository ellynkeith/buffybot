C' mere.
Huh?
Yeah, Anya can do it.
There, see? She'll be great.
(to Buffy) Hey, how goes the slaying?
Okay, now we're back to frightening.
(joking)  Bet you're sorry you said anything,  huh, Tara?
Okay, you know what? I'm tired of  being the one in the middle. I'm not  going to let you pull me into this.
What? No. Nothing to do with Buffy.

So, umâ€¦ think I should run get Buffy?
I'm gonna run get Buffy. (realizing) Or you can fight him!
(to Spike) What? Shut up! (to Olaf)  Um... listen...
(soothingly)  Hey, we can take care of hungry. How  'bout you just sit down, on one of  the sturdier chairs, and we can talk  calmly and have some food.

You really dated him?
But you like me better.
