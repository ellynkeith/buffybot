Tell me about it.
None. She thinks she's my kid sister.
How can I? (beat) She'd freak out and that's the last thing we need. We have to keep her safe.
Away where?
He's off in... Spain or something, with his secretary. Living the clich√©. I called when Mom got sick, he hasn't even... You know when he bailed on us, I remember Dawn cried for a week. Except she didn't. She was never there, but I can still feel what it was like.
They sent her to <u>me</u>, Giles. I think I have to take care of her. I want to.
No. No one. They'd all get weird around her. And it's safer for them if they don't know.
She'll come. (beat) She'll come for us.
Just leave it by the wall there for now.
Just be careful...
I notice you're doing the smallest amount of helping that can actually be called helping.
Or I'M gonna break something.
It's no big. Just, with Mom not feeling well, I'm hardly ever here anyway. Might as well save some money, for the semester, at least. That's all.
(suddenly tense) Where's Dawn?
(calling out) Dawn?
I know. Help me fold.
Nothing like getting you ass kicked to... make your ass hurt.
Bronze.
Oh, right. Right.
No, no, we can make it. I could definitely use a break from all this craziness.
Well, <b>sure</b> I forgot about the party. There's kind of a lot going on. And it's not, you know, the most thrilling social event of the season.
Sure. Barring monsters... (to Giles) Hey.
Any breakthroughs on the identity of Miss Congeniality?
Your definition of narrow is impressively wide.
She was kind of like... well she was kind of like Cordelia, actually. If she were on steroids. That were on steroids. (not helpful) I'm pretty sure she dyes her hair.
There's gotta be something on her.
So what'd you get her?
Tara. You said you had a present already.
I know.
Yeah yeah! Nice nice. I just sort of...
Oh yeah. (small beat) There's that thing, you know.
That thing of not understanding...
As for example. A lot of... not understanding. But she's so nice.
You think there'll be a lot of wiccans at the party? Big wiccan crowd?
Which is cool.
I just hope we fit in. Not awkward.
Okay. I'm having a present-buying headache. Tara's damn birthday is just one too many things to worry about.
Oh, I'm coming. I'm coming right <u>NOW</u>!
I saw a really nice sweater at Macy's, but I really want me to have it.
Tara's birthday. We're at a loss.
Honey, I'm home...
It's a rat race.
You're like a god. You're the god of boyfriends.
(also suggestively) Well, this earns you a very big favor. There could be outfits.
Whoah whoah whoah! Where are you going?
Since when?
You can't. It's not safe for you to walk there.
Did Mom say you could?
No. It's family night. (searching for excuses) And Melinda's a bad influence. I don't like you hanging out with someone that... short.
Oh, she makes me crazy...
What? She shouldn't be going over there.
She just can't be running out any time she wants to.
What do you mean?
We all have to be careful. This demon chick, she's... exciting and new. Don't really know what I'm up against.
No! I don't want them anywhere near this.
The less people that are involved, the safer I'll feel.
Wait. What --
Riley, I want you to help, I'm not...
No.
I let you come, now sit down and look studious.
The monk.
He's great... he's so considerate, and he's really understanding about my disturbing lifestyle, but every now and then he's mister snappy. I never know what sets him off.
Behold the cunning segue. Tara's being funky?
Well, families...
(concerned) What do you mean?
Giles! There's something in here!
Shut up!
Where is it? Tara can you see it?
I'm not sure I do either.
I think you better explain. What do you mean, what you are?
(looking at Dawn) Nearly got us killed.
It is. You want her, Mr. Maclay, you can go ahead and take her.
You just gotta go through me.
You heard me. You wanna take Tara out of here against her will, then you gotta come through me.
(points to Dawn) She's a hair-puller.
We're family.
And that only works with humans...
You came!
