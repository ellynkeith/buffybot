What are you thinking?
Oh, you're my little lamb...
Hi baby!
Oh you wouldn't <u>believe</u> it it was so exciting. I went to April Fools and absolutely <u>everything</u> was on sale.
Oh no I just killed the clerk. Still. Bargain's a bargain.
Oh! And I ran into Carol Beets -- you know, she sired Brandon -- Brandon from the sewer gang, and she said the Lei-ach demon was recruiting his brethren to kill the Slayer.
Apparently he got recruited by some big nether-wig and now he's on a mission. You think they might actually do it? Kill her?
Well, if they do, I think we should do something, like a gift basket or something -- where are you going?
