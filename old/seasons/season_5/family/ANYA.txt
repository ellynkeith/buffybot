But we just helped her move this stuff in a few days ago! (sees Buffy) And it was fun!
(crossing back in) Just a few days after we moved you in.
We have to bring presents, right? Birth is a present thing.
Thank you for coming! We value your patronage! Come again for more purchases!
I'm just so excited! They come in, I help them, they give us money in exchange for goods, you give me money for working for you... I have a place in the world now. I'm part of the system. I'm a workin' gal.
No, that's boring, I just wanna do the money parts.
Hi.
Mmmm..... We value your patronage...
I've already been injured this month...
Excuse me. What kind?
What kind of demon is she? There's a lot of different kinds, some are very very evil, some have been considered to be useful members of society...
Well, let's narrow it down...
But it's still not funny.
Let's just start again. You're explaining it wrong.
So what's an eagle reflection?
