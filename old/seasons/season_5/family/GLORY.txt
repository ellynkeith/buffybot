Okay. Now I'm upset.
I need a favor.
Do you love me?
Or...
Do you love me?
Oh, stop <u>whining</u>! You know, I remember when the Lei-ach were a proud warrior race, not sneaking around hospitals looking for weak sickly types to suck the bone marrow from. But let's talk about my problems for 30 seconds if that's perfectly all right with you.
Blonde. Short. Strong for a human and massively rude. Broke my shoe, took my monk... You got any idea who I might be talking about?
A slayer? Oh God, please don't tell me I was fighting a <u>vampire</u> slayer, how unbelievably common. If I had friends, and they heard about this... and you know she's telling everyone. She's probably going around -- <u>PAY ATTENTION</u>!
I am great and I am beautiful and when I walk in the room all eyes turn to me because my name is a holy name and you will <u>listen</u> or I will pull your vital organs out and put <u>this</u> one <u>here</u> and <u>this</u> one <u>here</u>.
Okay baby. Get your friends. Find the girl. Kill the girl. Yummy marrow for everyone and I don't have to do that organ thing. Okay?
You've got the cutest little suppurating sores, did anyone ever tell you that?
