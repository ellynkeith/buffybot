TARA: -- and took her to the pound. And at the pound there were lots of other kitties, and there were puppies, and some ferrets.
WILLOW: (sleepy) Were there dolphins?
TARA: Yes. Many dolphins at the pound.
WILLOW: Was there a camel?
TARA: There was the front of a camel. A half-camel.
WILLOW: Did the kitty get chosen by some people?
TARA: Well, now you've ruined the ending. There was a whole exciting middle part with the French Resistance.
WILLOW: I'm sleepy.
TARA: Yeah... do you mind if I keep the light on? I was gonna look up some spells.
WILLOW: That's fine. I don't need to be snuggled...
TARA: (smiling) Vixen.
WILLOW: You've been spell gal night and day lately.
TARA: Well, I just wanna keep up with you. And I'm... I'd like to be useful. You know, to the gang. I just never feel... useful.
WILLOW: You are. You're essential.
TARA: Think Buffy found anything out tonight?
WILLOW: At the factory? I don't know. If there was something, I figure she would've called us.
GILES: I don't know what to say.
BUFFY: Tell me about it.
GILES: It's just difficult to wrap one's mind around... and she has no idea?
BUFFY: None. She thinks she's my kid sister.
GILES: Are you going to tell her?
BUFFY: How can I? (beat) She'd freak out and that's the last thing we need. We have to keep her safe.
GILES: This woman, this... whatever she was, she knows you now. Should we be thinking about sending Dawn away?
BUFFY: Away where?
GILES: I don't know... Your father's?
BUFFY: He's off in... Spain or something, with his secretary. Living the clich√©. I called when Mom got sick, he hasn't even... You know when he bailed on us, I remember Dawn cried for a week. Except she didn't. She was never there, but I can still feel what it was like.
BUFFY: They sent her to <u>me</u>, Giles. I think I have to take care of her. I want to.
GILES: Do we tell the others?
BUFFY: No. No one. They'd all get weird around her. And it's safer for them if they don't know.
GILES: Yes. We have to find out who exactly this woman is, and what it is she needs Dawn for. If she comes after you --
BUFFY: She'll come. (beat) She'll come for us.
GLORY: Okay. Now I'm upset.
XANDER: Okay, just -- ow! Thumb! Necessary opposable thumb!
RILEY: Sorry. Crybaby.
BUFFY: Just leave it by the wall there for now.
RILEY: Got it.
DAWN: I don't need any help...
BUFFY: Just be careful...
ANYA: But we just helped her move this stuff in a few days ago! (sees Buffy) And it was fun!
GILES: People help each other out, Anya. It's one of our strange customs.
BUFFY: I notice you're doing the smallest amount of helping that can actually be called helping.
GILES: Well, I see myself in a patriarchal sort of role. You know, a lot of pointing and scowling.
GILES: Stop that, you two.
RILEY: He started it...
XANDER: He called me a bad name! I think it was bad; it might have been latin.
GILES: Stop. You're going to break something.
BUFFY: Or I'M gonna break something.
XANDER: Still can't believe you're giving up this cherry corner suite.
ANYA: (crossing back in) Just a few days after we moved you in.
BUFFY: It's no big. Just, with Mom not feeling well, I'm hardly ever here anyway. Might as well save some money, for the semester, at least. That's all.
WILLOW: I think that's smart.
XANDER: Still, hard to give up. Got the two entrances, lotta opportunities for bawdy french farce -- and everybody loves bawdy --
BUFFY: (suddenly tense) Where's Dawn?
RILEY: She just took --
BUFFY: (calling out) Dawn?
DAWN: Some of your CDs are my CDs
BUFFY: I know. Help me fold.
RILEY: Starting to feel that fight?
BUFFY: Nothing like getting you ass kicked to... make your ass hurt.
DAWN: You'll totally take her next time.
XANDER: 'Cause you'll have back up, baby. She's messin' with ALL of us.
GILES: Yes, we'll find her weaknesses, and then...
TARA: Yeah, you learn her source and we'll introduce her to her insect reflection.
TARA: (much quieter) That was funny if you've studied Taglarin mystic rites and... are a total dork...
RILEY: The how come Xander didn't laugh?
XANDER: I don't know that Taglarin stuff.
RILEY: Oh.
WILLOW: You wanna start taking stuff down to the car?
TARA: I really do.
TARA: Stupid...
WILLOW: Okay, guys, now remember, you gotta be at the Bronze by eight.
BUFFY: Bronze.
WILLOW: Tomorrow night! Tara's birthday!
BUFFY: Oh, right. Right.
ANYA: We have to bring presents, right? Birth is a present thing.
XANDER: I got something... picked out, yeah...
WILLOW: You all can still come, right? I mean, I know there's this new evil and all...
BUFFY: No, no, we can make it. I could definitely use a break from all this craziness.
INTERN: Another crazy. Got her family out there... 
BEN: Let me guess. No history of mental problems.
INTERN: That makes, like, five this month.
BEN: They told me Sunnydale was gonna be interesting...
INTERN: Aren't you off?
BEN: (looks at his watch) As of now. Have fun.
GLORY: I need a favor.
ANYA: Thank you for coming! We value your patronage! Come again for more purchases!
GILES: We could perhaps be a bit less effusive, Anya Let's not frighten the people away.
ANYA: I'm just so excited! They come in, I help them, they give us money in exchange for goods, you give me money for working for you... I have a place in the world now. I'm part of the system. I'm a workin' gal.
GILES: (smiles) Yes. Well why don't you start organizing the shipping orders?
ANYA: No, that's boring, I just wanna do the money parts.
BUFFY: Well, <b>sure</b> I forgot about the party. There's kind of a lot going on. And it's not, you know, the most thrilling social event of the season.
XANDER: It's a big deal for Will, though -- I mean you are gonna be there?
BUFFY: Sure. Barring monsters... (to Giles) Hey.
ANYA: Hi.
XANDER: Gimme sugar. I've come to buy sugar.
ANYA: Mmmm..... We value your patronage...
BUFFY: Any breakthroughs on the identity of Miss Congeniality?
GILES: Well, I've narrowed it down some...
BUFFY: Your definition of narrow is impressively wide.
GILES: Well, you didn't give me much to go on. She looks human, so the mug shots aren't any use... you can't be a bit more specific about what she was like?
BUFFY: She was kind of like... well she was kind of like Cordelia, actually. If she were on steroids. That were on steroids. (not helpful) I'm pretty sure she dyes her hair.
GILES: (dryly) Ah yes that one of course our work is done.
BUFFY: There's gotta be something on her.
XANDER: (joins them, re: books) The answer's somewhere here. It's right in front of us and we're too blind to see it. (off their looks) What? You've never wanted to say that? (off their looks) I'm helping, I'm reading, I'm quiet.
BUFFY: So what'd you get her?
XANDER: Huh?
BUFFY: Tara. You said you had a present already.
XANDER: Yeah. That was a tangled web of lies, sweetie. I'm not really sure what kind of thing she'd... I mean I don't really know her that well.
BUFFY: I know.
XANDER: I mean she's nice --
BUFFY: Yeah yeah! Nice nice. I just sort of...
XANDER: I don't necessarily 'get' her. But she's real nice!
BUFFY: Oh yeah. (small beat) There's that thing, you know.
XANDER: (already agreeing) That thing.
BUFFY: That thing of not understanding...
XANDER: Half of what she says?
BUFFY: As for example. A lot of... not understanding. But she's so nice.
XANDER: You betchya.
BUFFY: You think there'll be a lot of wiccans at the party? Big wiccan crowd?
XANDER: That's sort of her deal. Her and Willow are all... wiccie. Swinging with the wiccan lifestyle.
BUFFY: Which is cool.
XANDER: Oh yeah.
BUFFY: I just hope we fit in. Not awkward.
XANDER: With Willow, it's like she's got this whole new thing in her life, but she's still Willow, I can always figure her out. But Tara, I just know she likes Willow, and she already has one of those.
BUFFY: Okay. I'm having a present-buying headache. Tara's damn birthday is just one too many things to worry about.
XANDER: Relax. You should take a few minutes, train, or stretch out... do something to work off the tension.
SPIKE: You want me, Slayer? Come and get me.
BUFFY: Oh, I'm coming. I'm coming right <u>NOW</u>!
HARMONY: What are you thinking?
SPIKE: All about you, baby.
HARMONY: Oh, you're my little lamb...
GILES: Come up with anything?
XANDER: Well candles, maybe, or bath oils of some kind.
BUFFY: I saw a really nice sweater at Macy's, but I really want me to have it.
GILES: And you are talking about what on earth?
BUFFY: Tara's birthday. We're at a loss.
GILES: You're in a magic shop and you can't think of anything Tara might like. I believe you're both profoundly stupid.
XANDER: Well, we don't know what kind of things witches really like. What, are we gonna get her some cheesy crystal ball?
GILES: Bloody well better not. I've already got mine wrapped.
DONNY: Are all these magic books?
GILES: Private collection. The books for sale are along the wall there.
DONNY: So all these books got spells in 'em? Turn people into frogs?
XANDER: Yeah, we're building a race of frog-people. It's a good time.
DONNY: (to all of them) So, are you all witches? Hey, don't do a spell on me...
GILES: Was there something in particular you were looking for?
WILLOW: 'Her insect reflection'... that's so good...
TARA: I just thought that'd be funny, you know, if her power was centered in --
DONNY: Well what do you know.
DONNY: What's the matter? Don't got a hug for you big brother?
WILLOW: Brother?
DONNY: Tara didn't say she had a brother? (smiles) I'm a dirty little secret.
TARA: Willow, this is D-Donny.
WILLOW: Hi.
DONNY: Nice to meet you.
TARA: (indicating the gang) And these are m-my friends.
DONNY: What, alla you hang out? (to Tara, playfully) That's more people than you MET in high school. (to the others) Tara wasn't too social back when. I don't think she <b>spoke</b> till she was eight --
TARA: How did you find-- I mean, how come you came?
DONNY: Well, duh, birthday girl. We came down in the camper, been all over the campus --
TARA: We?
DONNY: Dad, you know, and cousin Beth. We went all over campus looking. They oughta circle back here in a bit.
TARA: (a bit urgent) No, we should find them. We could go -- (looks at Willow) -- I should go meet them.
WILLOW: Yeah, sure --
DONNY: Look who I found...
TARA: Dad! Hi.
MACLAY: Well. There's my girl.
TARA: It's such a s-surprise.
MACLAY: Yes.
TARA: Hey, Beth.
BETH: Hey.
MACLAY: One of your dorm-mates said you might be here.
TARA: Oh. (pause) Oh, these are friends... this is Mister Giles, he runs the shop.
GILES: How do you do.
MACLAY: Pleasure. (to Tara) Well, I don't mean to interrupt your plans, I know we've come on you kind of suddenly. But I thought we'd have dinner.
TARA: Okay.
MACLAY: Why don't I pick you up at six? And we'll... do some catching up.
TARA: Yes sir.
MACLAY: (to the group) Forgive me for running out --  we're double parked.
DONNY: (holding a skull) Didn't Uncle Jeff have a scar like this? He could have been dug up...
MACLAY: Donald. (to Tara) I'll see you tonight.
DONNY: Nice to meet you all.
WILLOW: That's so weird. Your whole family.
TARA: Yeah.
WILLOW: They seem nice.
TARA: They're okay. You know. Families are always...
WILLOW: They make you crazy.
TARA: Usually. You wanna get into research mode?
WILLOW: Sure.
BUFFY: Honey, I'm home...
RILEY: Did you have a good day at work?
BUFFY: It's a rat race.
RILEY: I squared away the rest of your stuff. Wouldn't even know you ever left.
BUFFY: You're like a god. You're the god of boyfriends.
RILEY: (intimately) Nah, I just like it when you owe me favors.
BUFFY: (also suggestively) Well, this earns you a very big favor. There could be outfits.
RILEY: Be still my heart.
DAWN: See you later!
BUFFY: Whoah whoah whoah! Where are you going?
DAWN: I'm going to Melinda's for dinner.
BUFFY: Since when?
DAWN: (puzzled) Nowish...
BUFFY: You can't. It's not safe for you to walk there.
DAWN: It's across the street.
BUFFY: Did Mom say you could?
DAWN: Mom's napping. What's the big deal, I'm just --
BUFFY: No. It's family night. (searching for excuses) And Melinda's a bad influence. I don't like you hanging out with someone that... short.
DAWN: I'm so glad you're moving back into the house. That's the source of my gladness.
BUFFY: Oh, she makes me crazy...
RILEY: That's kind of the word I was searching for.
BUFFY: What? She shouldn't be going over there.
RILEY: Yeah, a lot of young people nowadays are experimenting with shortness. Gotta nip that in the bud.
BUFFY: She just can't be running out any time she wants to.
RILEY: It's more than that.
BUFFY: What do you mean?
RILEY: You tell me.
BUFFY: We all have to be careful. This demon chick, she's... exciting and new. Don't really know what I'm up against.
RILEY: If we're in trouble here, I could contact Graham, maybe get the government boys on this --
BUFFY: No! I don't want them anywhere near this.
RILEY: Just a suggestion.
BUFFY: The less people that are involved, the safer I'll feel.
RILEY: Every time I think I'm getting close to you... (he moves to go) I gotta take off.
BUFFY: Wait. What --
RILEY: I'll call you later.
BUFFY: Riley, I want you to help, I'm not...
RILEY: Yeah. (beat) I know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know. (resignedly) I'll come running.
MACLAY: The door wasn't locked. I was a little early.
MACLAY: I suppose you wanted me to see all these... toys.
MACLAY: You don't even try to hide it anymore. I'd hoped maybe you'd gotten over the witchcraft thing, that if we let you go you'd get it out of your system. Then they told me to look for you in the... that store.
TARA: I didn't... I didn't kn-know you were coming.
MACLAY: Of course we came. We haven't heard from you in months, your birthday's getting closer and closer, you know what that means...
TARA: I don't think it's... It won't mean that --
MACLAY: You're turning twenty. The same age your mother was when... do your friends even know?
TARA: Y-yes.
MACLAY: Are you lying to me?
MACLAY: So they don't know. They think you're human.
MACLAY: Tara, you're coming home with us. You know it's the only way.
TARA: Home?
MACLAY: This charade has gone on for too long. Do you want to put your friends in danger?
TARA: I would never hurt them.
MACLAY: Tara, you can't control what's going to happen. You're my daughter and I love you but you are a demon. You have evil inside you and it will come out. And letting yourself work all this magic is only gonna make it worse. Where do you think that power comes from?
TARA: I... it doesn't feel... evil. Sir.
MACLAY: Evil never does.
MACLAY: I don't feel much like eating right now. I'll give you a little time, but we need to be gone by morning.
MACLAY: Your family loves you, Tara, no matter what. How do you think your friends are gonna feel when they see your true face?
GLORY: Do you love me?
GLORY: Or...
GLORY: Do you love me?
GLORY: Oh, stop <u>whining</u>! You know, I remember when the Lei-ach were a proud warrior race, not sneaking around hospitals looking for weak sickly types to suck the bone marrow from. But let's talk about my problems for 30 seconds if that's perfectly all right with you.
GLORY: Blonde. Short. Strong for a human and massively rude. Broke my shoe, took my monk... You got any idea who I might be talking about?
GLORY: A slayer? Oh God, please don't tell me I was fighting a <u>vampire</u> slayer, how unbelievably common. If I had friends, and they heard about this... and you know she's telling everyone. She's probably going around -- <u>PAY ATTENTION</u>!
GLORY: I am great and I am beautiful and when I walk in the room all eyes turn to me because my name is a holy name and you will <u>listen</u> or I will pull your vital organs out and put <u>this</u> one <u>here</u> and <u>this</u> one <u>here</u>.
GLORY: Okay baby. Get your friends. Find the girl. Kill the girl. Yummy marrow for everyone and I don't have to do that organ thing. Okay?
GLORY: You've got the cutest little suppurating sores, did anyone ever tell you that?
WILLOW: Hey.
TARA: Hey.
WILLOW: Was... dinner fun?
WILLOW: Well, there's scoobyage afoot. Giles called a meeting about our spanking new menace.
TARA: Oh. You should go, they don't need me for that, you can fill me in...
WILLOW: No no, you gotta come. This demon chick is supposed to be really powerful and I was thinking maybe we could try that spell, you know, the one to find demons...
TARA: That didn't work.
WILLOW: Yeah, but we only tried it one time. I think I got the ingredients wrong.
TARA: Well, I'm tired. We can try it tomorrow.
WILLOW: You sure you don't --
TARA: My family's here, I can't just... not everything is about your friends and stuff
WILLOW: (hurt) Sorry.
TARA: No, no, I'm... there's just so much going on. I'm just... I'm real tired.
WILLOW: Okay.
TARA: I'll see you in the morning and you can fill me in.
WILLOW: Great. We'll be demon hunters.
XANDER: Hey, Will.
WILLOW: Am I late? Did I miss exposition?
GILES: No, no, and I've nothing earth shattering to relate. I did have a few thoughts, though, and I want to make sure we're all on the same page.
DAWN: Can I buy one of these?
BUFFY: No.
DAWN: With my own money?
BUFFY: I let you come, now sit down and look studious.
TARA: Blind Cadria, desolate queen, work my will upon them all, your curse upon them, my obeisance to you.
GILES: Now, I think I may have a lead on the monk Buffy spoke with. There are a few orders I've read up on...
GILES: I'm sorry, where was I?
BUFFY: The monk.
GILES: Yes. I'd like us to start looking into some of these orders. It's possible that whatever order this monk was from was wiped out entirely, and I'm sure that wouldn't go unnoticed --
BARTENDER: You shouldn't be coming here, man. You got a rep with these monsters. You come in night after night... you looking to get killed?
RILEY: I come for the ambiance. What can I say; the place just reeks of class.
BARTENDER: If Willy was here...
RILEY: Willy's not here. (re -- drink) Hit me.
SANDY: Drinking alone? That's not a good sign.
RILEY: So they tell me. (he looks at her) I buy you a drink, neither one of us has that problem anymore, now de we?
SANDY: Vodka tonic.
RILEY: (to the Bartender, as if introducing her) Vodka tonic.
SANDY: I'm Sandy.
RILEY: I'm Riley.
SANDY: Place is such a dive...
RILEY: No, no, it's great. You just have to close your eyes... plug up your nostrils... then it's fine.
SANDY: We could go somewhere else... You know, more private...
RILEY: Sandy, Sandy... It's no good. My heart belongs to another. Besides I don't go out with vampires.
RILEY: (to the Bartender) They're never interested in my intellect.
BUFFY: He's great... he's so considerate, and he's really understanding about my disturbing lifestyle, but every now and then he's mister snappy. I never know what sets him off.
WILLOW: There's always gonna be a part of your life he can't get near. That's just part of relationships that people have to deal with, even if they feel shut out and the other person is acting all weird and doesn't want them to meet their family.
BUFFY: Behold the cunning segue. Tara's being funky?
WILLOW: She's just never been like that before.
BUFFY: Well, families...
WILLOW: So, they're dorky. I feel like... it's something more. She's different.
BUFFY: (concerned) What do you mean?
WILLOW: (blows it off) I don't know. I'm over reacty. Pay me no mind. People in love are always a little crazy.
HARMONY: Hi baby!
SPIKE: (you are boring and I loathe you) Hello, sweetbreads. Did you have fun?
HARMONY: Oh you wouldn't <u>believe</u> it it was so exciting. I went to April Fools and absolutely <u>everything</u> was on sale.
SPIKE: You <u>paid</u> for it?
HARMONY: Oh no I just killed the clerk. Still. Bargain's a bargain.
HARMONY: Oh! And I ran into Carol Beets -- you know, she sired Brandon -- Brandon from the sewer gang, and she said the Lei-ach demon was recruiting his brethren to kill the Slayer.
SPIKE: (suddenly interested) How's that?
HARMONY: Apparently he got recruited by some big nether-wig and now he's on a mission. You think they might actually do it? Kill her?
SPIKE: God, that would be pleasant.
HARMONY: Well, if they do, I think we should do something, like a gift basket or something -- where are you going?
SPIKE: Get myself a decent seat. If the Slayer's gonna die... I'm gonna watch.
BETH: Tara?
TARA: Beth! What are you --
BETH: I was looking for you.
TARA: Sorry we didn't get to have dinner... everything was so sudden.
BETH: I just wanted to make sure you were okay, see if you needed help with anything... packing...
TARA: Beth, I'm not... I'm n-not coming back with you.
BETH: You're not?
TARA: I don't think so.
BETH: You selfish bitch.
TARA: What?
BETH: I knew it. I knew you were gonna do something like this!
TARA: Like what? You c-can't just come here --
BETH: You don't care the slightest bitty bit about your family, do you? You dad's been worried sick about you every day you've been gone. There's a house needs taking care of, Donny and your dad having to do for themselves while you're down here living God knows what kind of lifestyle. Is it true you've been doing magic?
TARA: Yes.
BETH: Well then you deserve whatever you get. Come down here, doing spells... I can't wait 'til your little friends find out the truth about you. They will, you know. Doesn't matter how innocent you act, they'll see.
TARA: No they won't.
BETH: They will unless you do some kind of spell on them... (off Tara's reaction) You did.
TARA: N-no.
BETH: You did something to them. I'm telling your dad.
TARA: No! It wasn't anything!
BETH: You think you can just go around cursing people -- your dad's gonna pop --
TARA: It was just so they wouldn't see!
TARA: So they wouldn't be able to see the demon part of me. Please don't tell dad. It's harmless.
WILLOW: Is that Tara?
WILLOW: I guess not. Thought I heard something.
BETH: Don't you see how out of control you are? You've been lying to those people for a year, now you put a spell on them? Is that right? Is that a human thing to do?
BETH: Now I'm telling your father. If he doesn't force you to come home -- and I think he should -- I <u>know</u> he's gonna tell your friends the truth. If I were you I'd tell them first. Then I'd tell them goodbye.
ANY: Do I get overtime for this?
GILES: Certainly not. Dawn, shut the door.
BUFFY: Giles! There's something in here!
XANDER: It moved.
ANAY: Where is it? Where is it?
GILES: Under there. Go.
SPIKE: Uh, you're welcome...
XANDER: It's over there!
GILES: How many are there?
ANYA: I've already been injured this month...
BUFFY: Shut up!
TARA: Buffy behind you!
BUFFY: Where is it? Tara can you see it?
TARA: Oh God...
TARA: Blind Cadria, lift your veil, give evil form and break my spell --
MACLAY: Tara!
MACLAY: What in the name of God is that...?
SPIKE: Lei-ach Demon. Fun little buggers; big with the marrow-sucking.
MACLAY: I don't understand...
BUFFY: I'm not sure I do either.
TARA: I'm sorry... I'm s-so sorry...
TARA: I w-was just trying to hide... the spell went wrong...
WILLOW: Tara, what...
TARA: I didn't want you to see... what I am.
WILLOW: What you are?
MACLAY: I told you, you try to run from it you'll put these people in danger. (re: demon) And, my God...
TARA: I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.
BUFFY: I think you better explain. What do you mean, what you are?
MACLAY: Demon.
MACLAY: The women in our family have... demon in them. Her mother had it; it's where the magic comes from. This isn't something we generally like to share with strangers. We came to take her home before... well, before things like this started happening.
WILLOW: Tara, you're not... how could you not say something to me... to <b>me</b>...
GILES: You put a spell on us to keep us from seeing your demon side. That's why we couldn't see our attackers.
BUFFY: (looking at Dawn) Nearly got us killed.
TARA: I'll go. (to everyone) I'm very sorry.
MACLAY: The camper's outside.
WILLOW: Wait! Go? She just did a spell that went wrong! Buffy, it was just a mistake!
MACLAY: It's not the point and it's not your concern. The girl belongs with us. We know how to control her problem.
WILLOW: Tara, look at me. (she does) I trusted you more than anyone in my life. Was all of that a lie?
TARA: No! No...
WILLOW: Do you want to leave?
MACLAY: (to Willow) That is not your decision, young lady --
WILLOW: I know that. (to Tara) Do you want to leave?
MACLAY: You are going to do what's right, Tara. Now I am taking you out of here before somebody DOES get killed. The girl belongs with her family, I hope that's clear to the rest of you.
BUFFY: It is. You want her, Mr. Maclay, you can go ahead and take her.
BUFFY: You just gotta go through me.
MACLAY: What?
BUFFY: You heard me. You wanna take Tara out of here against her will, then you gotta come through me.
DAWN: And me.
MACLAY: Is this a joke? I am not gonna be threatened by two little girls.
DAWN: You don't wanna mess with us.
BUFFY: (points to Dawn) She's a hair-puller.
GILES: And you're not just dealing with two little girls.
XANDER: You're dealing with all of us.
SPIKE: Except me.
XANDER: Except Spike.
SPIKE: I don't care what happens.
MACLAY: This is insane! You people have no right to interfere in Tara's affairs. We are her <b>blood kin</b> -- who the hell are you?
BUFFY: We're family.
DONNY: Dad, you're not gonna let them --
DONNY: Tara, if you don't get in that car I swear by God I'm gonna beat you down.
XANDER: And I swear by your full and manly beard you're gonna break something trying.
BETH: Well, I hope you'll all be happy hanging around with a disgusting demon.
ANYA: Excuse me. What kind?
BETH: What?
ANYA: What kind of demon is she? There's a lot of different kinds, some are very very evil, some have been considered to be useful members of society...
BETH: Well, I don't... what does it matter?
MACLAY: Evil is evil.
ANYA: Well, let's narrow it down...
SPIKE: Uh huh... Why don't I make this simple...
TARA: OW!
SPIKE: Gyahh!
WILLOW: (pissed) Hey! (gets it) Hey!
TARA: (hands on nose) He hit my nose!
WILLOW: And it hurt! I mean, him!
BUFFY: And that only works with humans...
SPIKE: (re: Tara) There's no demon in there. (shakes off the last twinge) That's just the family legend, am I right? Bit of spin to keep the ladies in line? Oh, you're a piece of work. I like you.
TARA: (to Willow) I'm not a demon.
WILLOW: (smiling) You're not a demon.
TARA: He hurt my nose.
SPIKE: Yeah, you're welcome.
GILES: Mr. Maclay, I'd say your business here is finished.
MACLAY: (last ditch) Tara... for eighteen years your family has taken care of you and supported you, if you wanna turn you back --
TARA: Dad.
TARA: Just go.
MACLAY: Magic.
BETH: Are you happy now?
RILEY: Sorry I'm late.
BUFFY: You came!
RILEY: (softly) Of course I came.

ANYA: But it's still not funny.
TARA: No, no, it is, but you have to... understand the...
ANYA: Let's just start again. You're explaining it wrong.
DAWN: This place is so cool! Except I have to have this stupid stamp on my hand.
XANDER: Well, that's to keep you from boozing it up.
DAWN: Oh please. Only losers like to drink alcohol.
ANYA: So what's an eagle reflection?
WILLOW: My dance.
WILLOW: Good birthday?
TARA: Best birthday.
WILLOW: I still can't believe you never told me about your family and all that.
TARA: I was just afraid if you saw the kind of people I came from... you wouldn't wanna be anywhere near me.
WILLOW: See? That's where you're a dummy. I think about what you grew up with, and then look at what you are... it makes me proud. It makes me love you more.
TARA: Every time I... even at my worst, you always make me feel special. How do you do that?
WILLOW: Magic.
