Sorry. Crybaby.
Got it.
He started it...
She just took --
Starting to feel that fight?
The how come Xander didn't laugh?

Every time I think I'm getting close to you... (he moves to go) I gotta take off.
I'll call you later.
Yeah. (beat) I know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know. (resignedly) I'll come running.

Sorry I'm late.
(softly) Of course I came.
