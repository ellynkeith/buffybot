He means "the plan." When are we  gonna do the plan?
(snapping) When?!
We'll go back later.
Why are you talking to him?
I know who he is. He kills our kind.
So it doesn't really matter if we're actually holding the Slayer's sister, as long as she  thinks we are, she'll walk into the trap.
We've been talking it over, and we  decided we don't like this plan.
We're going to feed on the girl. And kill you. Maybe not in that order.
Time's up.
You're outta stakes, Slayer.
