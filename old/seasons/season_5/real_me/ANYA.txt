(sees Dawn) Hello there, little girl.
Look at this. Now I am burdened with a husband and several tiny pink children and more cash than I can reasonably manage.
Really?
Oh, I'm so pleased! Can I trade in the children for more cash?
Dawn, NO!
Especially now that she can enter your house anytime she wants.
In her room. I think she's still pretty freaked out.
Hey, don't-Dawn!
What do you think you're doing?
(dragging her back) I will after you come back inside the house.
No. It's not safe out here.
Vampires… they took…
Took her…
Dawn…
She ran out… Took her… Vampires.
