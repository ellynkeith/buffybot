Hey! What are you doing?
What are you doing HERE? Can't loiter. No loitering… That's why I'm a cat… Quiet... cat's in the cupboard, but they  find you anyway… and it hurts… (remembering some agony) Please make it stop…
Shut up! SHUT UP! They'll hear you!
Shhhhh! (intimately) I know you… curds and whey… I know what you are…
You don't belong here.
