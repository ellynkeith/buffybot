(shrugging) I'm not sure. An X-ray, I guess.
(turns to her) Dawn...
Riley.
I do. I'm glad. I just - I didn't want  to... until we know what it is...
They did a CATscan. I was just going in to find out... (breaks from him) Can you stay with Dawn for a minute while I talk to mom? She's in the waiting room.
Um, hi...
Okay if I...?
She's with Riley. Watching TV in the  waiting room.
OR?
Mom...
Mom, what did they find?
Right. No concern.
Do you have the results yet?
No. Excuse me, no, Doctor. Not to be  rude, but I don't wanna sit down. I've  been doing nothing but sitting down  for hours. Just tell me...
Things? What things?
(cutting him off) But what can we do?
Well, I... is there something I should be doing? Can I... help?
What's "a real chance?"
(thrown) I'm not... sure...
I think. She uses one of those... She had an ear thing, but...
I don't think so... Maybe.
I'm sorry...
It's... It's okay.
You-- They didn't send for him?
Thank you. Ben, right?
He was telling me there's nothing I can do.
A break?
It's bad, Riley.
I've got to do something.
Maybe there's some magic or something -- a healing spell.
That attitude's not helping. I have to  try.
I need to talk to Giles. Can you drop Dawn off at school for me? Tell her I'll meet her at the magic shop when she gets out.
Tell her... Tell her they don't know anything yet.
(mid-sentence) ...so I figure there has to be some kind of mystical cure, right? A spell or - or a potion or something. I mean, we have to look.
Why? What do you mean?
What happened?
(hard) Giles.
Oh my God. Are you guys okay? Did anyone get...
Okay. That's... good. So how'd she get away with the bad mojo stuff?
Sobek...
So - she's making a monster. What for? What does it do?
Okay. You keep working on it. I'll go kill it.
I m going.
I wasn't ready for her last time. I am now.
(cuts her off/too intense) But what? I can't just sit here, Willow. I have to do something.
Fight?
We're not done here, demon-bitch!
No. I'm really not. I... I couldn't stop  her. I couldn't even slow her down.
Sunnydale Memorial.
I just want to warn you. The thing she  conjured is loose. Big snake thing.  Not Mayor big, but pretty lethal looking...
School's out. Dawn should be on the  way over to you now. Giles--
Dawn. She's kinda fragile right now.  About mom.
Thanks. Mom's going to wake up soon... So, you know - I have to be here. When the doctor...
Yeah, she's waiting for us.
(beat) We'll see.
Any monster reptile sightings?
Watch the--
I've got to stop this monster before it  gets back to Glory...
That's what she called herself. Giles, she's  going to know Dawn's the Key if we don't-
Do you want me to stay?
Okay.
You look beautiful.
Will do.
Minimal damage of the fighting kind. It's all... the other kind.
I can't. Not now. They need me, you know?
If I start now, I won't be able to stop.
