Mmmm...
What, me?-- I was, uh... (stashing the sweater behind him) Uh...
What are you doing in here?
Oh, yeah? Well... me, too.
(scoffing) Noo...
Yeah, alright. I did. It's a predator thing. Nothing wrong with it. Know your enemy's scent. Whet the appetite for the hunt...
Yeah, that's the stuff. Slayer musk.  Bitter and, and aggravating... Rrrr.
Watch it! Easy! You're bruising the leather.
I know for a bleeding fact the Slayer wouldn't mind me being here.
Your girl in the habit of buying her  enemies drinks? 'Cause she spent the  better part of last night with me -  doing just that.
'Kay. How 'bout this one? Twice in recent memory, she's had the loverwiccas do a de-invite on the house, keep out specific vamps. Ever ask yourself why she's never taken my name off the guest list?
Yeah. Right. Takes one to know, I s'pose. Least I still got the attitude. What've you got? A piercing glance? Face it, white bread, Buffy's got a type and you're not it. She likes us dangerous, rough, occasionally bumpy in the forehead region...
Hey! Hey!
Here! Bloody pull me back in, you sod. I'm starting to sizzle.
Oh, yeah? That why you're with her  at the hospital right now. Giving her  what she needs.
Don't you know? Didn't she call you?
Mum is sickly. Buffy took her to the  hospital for a little prod and probe.  Bite-sized one went too. (then, enjoying himself) Funny her not calling you about it. I've known since last night.
Whoa, whoa! Blanket!
