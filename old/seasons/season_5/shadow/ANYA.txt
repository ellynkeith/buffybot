Yay. Am I mentioned?
That's what I've been saying. I mean,  I, for one, wasn't looking forward to  starting my day with a slaughter. (thoughtfully, pleased with herself) Which, really, just goes to show how  much I've grown.
Just do what I do - Flip through pages and look busy.
Hey... Hey!! HEY HEY!!!
(to Giles) You sold someone Khul's amulet AND a Sobekian Blood Stone.
Are you stupid or something?
You never sell those things together!  It's bad news. Don't you know about  the Sobekites?
Damn straight.
And we've done just about enough making things worse for one day, haven't we?
I did not! I-
My clumsiness? That is so-
-like me. Slippery, slippery butterfingers.
Giles sold it to her.
A few thousand years ago there was this cult. The Temple of Sobek.
Reptile demon. Sobekites were reptile worshippers.
(glaring at him) Great. Thank you very much for those nightmares.
Anyway, their high priest Khul had great, mystic powers. He forged an Amulet with transmogrifying crystal.
Khul and the Sobekites started to transmogrify a race of reptile creatures. Different "blood stones" were created for different species of reptiles.
