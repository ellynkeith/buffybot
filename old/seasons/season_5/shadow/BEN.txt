Excuse me, doc, but they told me you're needed in ICU.
Why page when they can send me for the personal touch?
Thought you looked like you needed a break. Guy's great, but he doesn't have that bone in his head, tells him when to back off.
I'm sure someone did somewhere. They always do. He really is a good doctor. Your mom's in good hands.
Right.
And I'm gonna say the same thing. Give yourself a break. Listen, your mom's gonna be unconscious for at least another six, seven hours...
I just mean, go out. Get some air.  Come back later this evening,  talk to the doc then if you want.
My unsolicited advice of the day.
