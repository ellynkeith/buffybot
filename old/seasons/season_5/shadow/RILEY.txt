(calling) Hello? Buffy?
What are you doing in here?
Looking for the girl who's going to rip  your arms off when she finds out you  were in her room.
Were you... Were you just smelling her  sweater?
Out.
(sarcastic) Right. What's a little sweater sniffing between sworn enemies?
(not buying it) 'Cause you two are such tight pals.  Tell me another.
Because you're harmless.
Am I dark enough for you now?
You don't know anything about Buffy. Never did. I'm the only one that knows what she needs.
What are you talking about?
Tell me!
Hey. I heard and I thought maybe you'd need...
I understand.
How's she doing?
You got it.
I know.
Do something?
Healing spell? Buffy... People get sick. I don't think magic can help--
Okay.
Whatever you need me to do.
Buffy...
What do you want me to tell Dawn? About your mom.
You're melting.
Maybe I'm not making this any better.
Really.
Absolutely, she will. Summers women are tough.
Well... Thanks.
Really. Angel... made her cry a lot, huh?
All...
Uh-huh.
Where's Buffy?
What? Where?
And you let Buffy go after her? Alone?
(to Xander) She'll get herself killed. It's crazy.
This is different.
It's cool.
Just a little crazed.
If she needs me...
You okay? You look pretty beat up.
Come here.
It's okay... You need to let it out. I'm  right here.
