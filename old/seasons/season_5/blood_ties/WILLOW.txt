-- this is exactly what you need! A twentieth birthday party with presents and funny hats and candles you can't blow out! (to Tara) Those used to scare me.
You know what they say. The bigger they  are…
Then we have to find something heavier to throw.
Just once I'd like to hear a reference to balloon  animals.
Tara and I could work on some tactical spells.  If she's not too punchable, maybe she's not  totally invulnerable to magic.
They got a point. Whatever Glory's planning  on opening with the Key I'm guessing it won't  be filled with flowers and candy.
You know and you didn't tell us?
You should have told us.
Dawn, hey. Yeah, it's an early warning  incantation. If anything Hellgod-ishly  powerful comes within a hundred feet of  the shop, screechy Siren things'll, you  know - screech.

I don't think Buffy would like the Black Arts  bumping auras with littlest Summers.
She's real. She's just kinda… new.

Maybe - maybe that way.
Where would you go? If you felt lost  and alone? Where would you go?
We looked but… no Dawn.
We checked there too.
(Latin) Discede! (Be Gone) 
(weakly) Teleportation spell… Still working out the  kinks…
Don't know. That's one of the kinks…
(wiping blood from her nose) Yep. Won't be trying that one again soon.
