We're going up against a god. An actual,  mightier-than-thou god.
A crazy Hellgod? And the fun just keeps  on leaving.
This is all great long term plan-y stuff, but  what about this Key thingy Glory's looking for?
So where should we start looking? Do we  know where it used to be kept? Who saw it last -
You what?!
As opposed to the other kind we're always in?  Glory's going nuts trying to get her hands on  the Key, and you've known where it is all along?
Know what?
Yeah. Right on top. Perched, ready for  action. How's my sweet fancy Dawn  doing?
(covering) Anya, you want to help me with that thing?
(startled) Me? Me not weird.
No. no, we really weren't.
Again, not so much. In fact, none.
Anya…
Maybe we could…
And why Glory's got a big girl god jones  for it.
The Dawnmeister Chronicles?
But none of those memories are real.
I'm just saying she might <u>avoid</u> the places  she remembers because of that.
There are so many things I remember.  Seeing Dawn, hanging with her, listening  to Buffy complain about her. Mostly  that last one. How could all of those  things just… never have happened?
And I'm guessing some kind of  super-powerful in her raw form.
You know, she's uh, she's kinda got a  crush on me.
Well, no, nothing, I'm just saying, powerful  being, big important energy gal, diggin' the  Xan-man. Some guys are just cooler, you  know…
I'm sorry, Buff.
That's a happy thing, right?
