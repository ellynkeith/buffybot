All right, fellas! Today we got greens and  blues and hey! Chartreuse! It's a party!
Byzantium…
How many?
What?! What is she going to do? Send a  six-pack of minions to bore me to death?  Glory can't lay a finger on me. You know  it, I know it, <u>she</u> knows it. So save the  threats - or I'll finish the job I started on your head.
Two steaming cups of chocolate goodness.  Courtesy of whoever I swiped it from out  of the cupboard.
Couldn't find any marshmallows. I'll try  to steal some for next time.

(warm and gentle) Dawn, was your mom brought back in?  Is that why you're here?
Is there anybody I can call? Your sister?
Oh. You two have a fight? (a beat) It's okay. I know how that goes. I got a  sister, too. They can be a real pain  sometimes, huh? I'll tell you, there's been  a lot of nights I wish <u>she</u> didn't exist either.
Look, I know it can feel that way sometimes,  but when you're older -
Dawn -
You're the Key?
Go. Before she finds you. Don't ask me  how she knows, 'cause she always knows,  just go.

(totally losing it) No no no no! You're what she's been  searching for. I'm telling you, run!  You don't know! You - (stiffening in horror) Oh no. Oh god, no. She's coming. I  can feel it. You've got to get out!  SHE'S HERE - OH, NO…
She's <u>HERE</u>!
