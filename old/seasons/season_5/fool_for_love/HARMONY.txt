Spike? What are you doing?
Okay, I'm trying to be supportive here, so don't drive a stake through my heart like last time, but...
...You can't kill Buffy. She's the Slayer. She is so gonna kick your ass.
Tch! I knew you'd take it personally. You're so sensitive.
How are you going to kill her? Think. The second you even point that thing at her you're gonna be all... (Spike imitation) "Aaah!" and then you'll get bitch-slapped up and down Main Street unless she's had enough and just stakes you.
No! And then you'll come back to me and stomp around and swear a bunch of weird English curses.
What is a "bollock," anyway?
Fine. But don't come crying to me when you fail. You couldn't kill her <u>before</u> you got the chip! You had plenty of chances...
