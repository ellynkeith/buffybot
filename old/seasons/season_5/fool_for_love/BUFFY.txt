You know, it's probably none of my business, but I just gotta ask:
Did you smell this bad when you were alive?
If it's a post-mortem thing, then hey. <i>So</i> not your fault, and boy is my face red. But just so you know...
The fast-growing field of personal grooming's come a long way since you became a vampire.
Aah!
I can't believe I passed out. Do you think I'm a total wuss now?
You said it wasn't that bad.
No major organs got kebabed.
That would put me in a real hospital, which would get my real Mom real freaked. Can't do it.
I'd call you world-class butthead then make you go. Don't worry. Accelerated healing powers come with the Slayer package.
And the boyfriend who comes complete with combat medical training? That's the Buffy Summers bonus.
Vampire
One.
I think he was just the regular kind. Extra stinky, if that's any help. Oh, and he had this very eighties, Van Halen-y hair band 'do.
But outside that, he was just your plain old, run of the mill, average undead guy. He just beat me.
I'm in the best physical shape of my life. If you're asking me how it happened, I don't...
Dawn.
Sure, Mom.
Hmm?
Oh, um...
You got it.
You are. A short, annoying man. If I show you something, promise not to tell?
Very. Mom can't know. Think you can help with the household stuff?
Dawn...
By yourself?
Do me a favor? Take the gang along with.
No question. But, knowing you're out there with full Scooby backup would ease the mind of your poor, injured girlfriend.
I really didn't.
Not until you're never.
Good. Let's hope she'll be more helpful than this one.
Same as all the others. Slayer called, blah, blah, blah, scary battles, blah, blah, blah, great protector, blah, blah, bl- oops, she's dead. Where are the details?
Gotta love a gal with an anvil. (then) But where are the details of the Slayer's last battle? What made that fight special? Why did she lose?
(grim) Got really close. I slipped up, Giles. I've been training harder than ever and still... (re: books) And there's nothing in any of these to help me understand why. I mean, I know every Slayer comes with an expiration mark on the package - but I want mine to be a long time from now. Like a Cheeto... If there were just a few good descriptions of what took other slayers out, I might be able to understand my mistake. Keep it from happening again.
It's okay to use the D-word, Giles.
(thinks/then) Why didn't the Watchers give fuller accounts of it? The journals just stop...
Unseemly? Damn. Love ya, but you Watchers are such prigs sometimes.
Don't even start, Spike.
Slayers. You killed two of them.
You're gonna show me how.
Update, Spike: we're not here to discuss the fine choice of hops.
It's about two Slayers. One in China during the Boxer Rebellion. One in New York. Both got killed...
By you. Tell the tale, you get the cash.
You know that's not what I...
What?
Don't get excited. I'm fine.
Just tell me what I want to know.
Were you born this big a pain in the ass?
So you traded up on the food chain. Then what?
So how'd you kill her?
You got off on it.
Not enough.
And that would be what?
No really. I just know I can handle myself.
Aah!!
So that it? Lesson over?
Give it to me.
What?
What's the difference?
How'd you kill the second one?
That didn't hurt?
Yeah?
That hurt, too?
How 'bout that?
How'd you kill 'em, Spike?
(firmly) I'm ready.
You think we're dancing?
(cutting him off) <u>No</u>. This is all- You're wrong.
(deadly) Get out of my sight, Spike. Now.
I mean it-
Spike-
Spike...
What the hell are you doing?!
Say it's true. Say I do want to...
It wouldn't be you, Spike. It would never be <u>you</u>.
You're beneath me.
Hey Mom, I put together that grocery list for you...
Are you okay?
Look under the sink?
Where you going?
What is it?
I know you will.
What is it now?
I don't want to talk about it.
