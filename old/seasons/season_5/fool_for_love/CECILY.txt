Leave me alone.
You and I?
I'm going to ask you a very personal question, and I demand an honest answer. Do you understand?
Your poetry. It's, they're not written about me... Are they?
Yes, but are they about me?
Oh, God...
Please stop.
I do see you.
That's the problem. You're nothing to me, William. You're beneath me.
