BUFFY: You know, it's probably none of my business, but I just gotta ask:
BUFFY: Did you smell this bad when you were alive?
BUFFY: If it's a post-mortem thing, then hey. <i>So</i> not your fault, and boy is my face red. But just so you know...
BUFFY: The fast-growing field of personal grooming's come a long way since you became a vampire.
BUFFY: Aah!
VAMPIRE: You going?
VAMPIRE: But, you were having so much fun a minute ago.
RILEY: What happened?
BUFFY: I can't believe I passed out. Do you think I'm a total wuss now?
RILEY: (sarcastic) Oh yeah. I like a girl who can play a few hard sets of tennis with a major stab wound.
BUFFY: You said it wasn't that bad.
RILEY: I said I've seen worse. There's a difference.
BUFFY: No major organs got kebabed.
RILEY: I still think you need to see a real doctor.
BUFFY: That would put me in a real hospital, which would get my real Mom real freaked. Can't do it.
RILEY: If our positions were reversed...
BUFFY: I'd call you world-class butthead then make you go. Don't worry. Accelerated healing powers come with the Slayer package.
BUFFY: And the boyfriend who comes complete with combat medical training? That's the Buffy Summers bonus.
RILEY: So tell me about the bad guy. Or, guys. What do you think they were?
BUFFY: Vampire
RILEY: How many?
BUFFY: One.
RILEY: So, what, he was like some kind of Super Vampire or something?
BUFFY: I think he was just the regular kind. Extra stinky, if that's any help. Oh, and he had this very eighties, Van Halen-y hair band 'do.
RILEY: That's scary.
BUFFY: But outside that, he was just your plain old, run of the mill, average undead guy. He just beat me.
RILEY: That ever happen before?
BUFFY: I'm in the best physical shape of my life. If you're asking me how it happened, I don't...
BUFFY: Dawn.
DAWN: Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt the sex-capades. I just wanted to tell you...
DAWN: ...Mom's coming.
JOYCE: Hi, Riley.
RILEY: Mrs. Summers. How are you feeling?
JOYCE: Fine. Bordering on chipper. And tomorrow, I'm planning to be obnoxious.
RILEY: Glad to hear it.
JOYCE: Buffy, when you get a minute, I want to go over the grocery list for next week, and there's some things I need picked up at the gallery.
BUFFY: Sure, Mom.
JOYCE: No rush.
JOYCE: Are you disinfecting something?
BUFFY: Hmm?
BUFFY: Oh, um...
DAWN: Mine.
DAWN: Some nail polish experiments are doomed before they even begin.
JOYCE: (to Dawn) But you keep pushing the envelope, honey. (to Buffy) See you in a few?
BUFFY: You got it.
DAWN: Did I just pull off a Slayer- related Mom cover-up thing?
DAWN: Come on. Who's the man?
BUFFY: You are. A short, annoying man. If I show you something, promise not to tell?
DAWN: Oh, cool. I mean, gross. I mean, both. Are you all red and squishy under there?
BUFFY: Very. Mom can't know. Think you can help with the household stuff?
DAWN: That's it? I cover your butt and then you dump your chores on me?
BUFFY: Dawn...
DAWN: I got it, you're covered, we're good. (examines wound) Lucky it's not bikini season.
RILEY: So. Dawn takes household duty. I'll pick up tonight's patrol.
BUFFY: By yourself?
RILEY: It's just a sweep.
BUFFY: Do me a favor? Take the gang along with.
RILEY: I'll be okay.
BUFFY: No question. But, knowing you're out there with full Scooby backup would ease the mind of your poor, injured girlfriend.
RILEY: You forgot "manipulative."
BUFFY: I really didn't.
RILEY: Okay. I'll patrol tonight with the group.
DAWN: When do I get to patrol?
BUFFY: Not until you're never.
XANDER: (whispering) What's with the hand move? You see that? Does that like, mean something?
ANYA: (whispering) Oh, he's just trying to look important.
WILLOW: (whispering) It's code. I think it breaks down to "Choo-choo."
XANDER: (whispering) That doesn't sound right.
ANYA: (whispering) It probably means to follow him. That, or wait here for him.
WILLOW: (whispering) Ask.
XANDER: (YELLING) HEY! Riley! What's the... (hand gestures) ...all about?
RILEY: It means yell real loud so the vampires who don't know we're coming will have a sporting chance.
XANDER: (to Willow) See? Now you made him all mad and sarcastic.
WILLOW: You're the one who's doing all the yelling, Mr. Stealthy-pants.
ANYA: It's their fault.
RILEY: Um, guys? I'm thinking we could cover more ground if we split up. Tell you what: I'll cover the cemeteries - you take the Bronze.
ANYA: Are we not being covert enough?
XANDER: We're sorry.
WILLOW: Sorry!
XANDER: We'll get sneakier. Promise.
RILEY: Just... ditch the chips, watch my back.
WILLOW: Done.
XANDER: You know what he's like? He's like a cat. You know, a big jungle cat. How come I'm not like that? It's just so cool...
WILLOW: (mouth full) I think you're cool...
GILES: Here's another one. Early eighteenth century Slayer...
BUFFY: Good. Let's hope she'll be more helpful than this one.
GILES: Why? What does it say?
BUFFY: Same as all the others. Slayer called, blah, blah, blah, scary battles, blah, blah, blah, great protector, blah, blah, bl- oops, she's dead. Where are the details?
GILES: (helpfully) This slayer forged her own weapons.
BUFFY: Gotta love a gal with an anvil. (then) But where are the details of the Slayer's last battle? What made that fight special? Why did she lose?
GILES: You didn't lose last night, Buffy - you just...
BUFFY: (grim) Got really close. I slipped up, Giles. I've been training harder than ever and still... (re: books) And there's nothing in any of these to help me understand why. I mean, I know every Slayer comes with an expiration mark on the package - but I want mine to be a long time from now. Like a Cheeto... If there were just a few good descriptions of what took other slayers out, I might be able to understand my mistake. Keep it from happening again.
GILES: Yes, well, the problem is that after the final battle, it's hard to get any... The slayer's not... She's rather-
BUFFY: It's okay to use the D-word, Giles.
GILES: Dead. And hence - not forthcoming.
BUFFY: (thinks/then) Why didn't the Watchers give fuller accounts of it? The journals just stop...
GILES: I suppose, if they were anything like me, previous Watchers just found the topic too...
BUFFY: Unseemly? Damn. Love ya, but you Watchers are such prigs sometimes.
GILES: (simply) Painful. I was going to say.
GILES: But you're right. Accounts of final battles would be helpful - and now there's no one left to tell the tales.
GILES: What?
SPIKE: Ow! Wait. Not ow. You feeling all right, Slayer? That stuff usually hurts...
BUFFY: Don't even start, Spike.
SPIKE: What do you --
BUFFY: Slayers. You killed two of them.
SPIKE: (wary, is this payback?) I did.
BUFFY: You're gonna show me how.
SPIKE: You know, there's quite a few American beers that are highly underrated.
SPIKE: This unfortunately is not one of them.
BUFFY: Update, Spike: we're not here to discuss the fine choice of hops.
BUFFY: It's about two Slayers. One in China during the Boxer Rebellion. One in New York. Both got killed...
BUFFY: By you. Tell the tale, you get the cash.
SPIKE: Right. You want to learn all about how I bested the Slayers, and you want to learn fast. All right then: We fought, I won, the end, pay up.
BUFFY: You know that's not what I...
SPIKE: (interrupting) What did you want? Eh? A quick demo? Blow-for-blow description you can map out and memorize? Pfah. It's not about the moves, Love. And since I agreed to your little proposition, we're going to do this my way. Wings.
BUFFY: What?
SPIKE: Spicy buffalo wings. Order me up a plate, I'm feeling peckish.
SPIKE: As I thought. Some nasty thing got a taste of you.
BUFFY: Don't get excited. I'm fine.
SPIKE: Right, stuck in a dark corner with the creature you loathe, digging up past uglies. 'Cause you're "fine."
BUFFY: Just tell me what I want to know.
SPIKE: I told you, no one's narrating on an empty stomach here...
BUFFY: Were you born this big a pain in the ass?
SPIKE: What can I tell you, baby? I've always been bad.
SPIKE: "Lu-mi-nous..." no, no, uh, "irra-di-ant..." better...
SPIKE: Quickly, I'm the very spirit of vexation. What's another word for "illuminate?" It's perfectly perfect as many words go but the bother is nothing rhymes, you see.
SPIKE: (under his breath) Cecily.
PARTYGOER: ...I've heard on good authority they're not human at all. Animals of some sort. Escaped from a traveling sideshow.
PARTYGOER: But wild animals would leave a trace of some kind. Tracks...
PARTYGOER: Mangled bodies...
PARTYGOER: Charles! Don't be ghastly. I merely point out that it's something of a mystery, and the police should keep an open mind.
PARTYGOER: Ah, William. Favor us with your opinion. What do you make of this rash of disappearances sweeping our town? Animals - or thieves?
SPIKE: I prefer not to think of such dark, ugly business at all. That's what police are for.
SPIKE: I prefer placing my energies into creating things of beauty.
PARTYGOER: I see. Well. Don't withhold, William.
PARTYGOER: Rescue us from a dreary topic.
SPIKE: Careful!
SPIKE: Ink's still wet. Please, it's not finished...
PARTYGOER: Don't be shy. (reading) "My heart expands 'tis grown a bulge in't inspired by your beauty effulgent." <i>Effulgent</i>?
PARTYGOER: And that's actually one of his better compositions.
PARTYGOER: Have you heard, they call him "William the Bloody" because of his bloody awful poetry.
PARTYGOER: It suits him. I'd rather have a railroad spike through my head than listen to that awful stuff...
SPIKE: Cecily...
CECILY: Leave me alone.
SPIKE: They're vulgarians. Can't you see? They're not like you and I.
CECILY: You and I?
CECILY: I'm going to ask you a very personal question, and I demand an honest answer. Do you understand?
CECILY: Your poetry. It's, they're not written about me... Are they?
SPIKE: They're about how I feel.
CECILY: Yes, but are they about me?
SPIKE: Every syllable.
CECILY: Oh, God...
SPIKE: I know... This is sudden. And - and, please, if they're no good, they're only words. But the feeling behind them... I love you, Cecily.
CECILY: Please stop.
SPIKE: I know I'm a bad poet. But I'm a good man. All I ask is that you try to see me...
CECILY: I do see you.
CECILY: That's the problem. You're nothing to me, William. You're beneath me.
SPIKE: Bloody... watch where you're going!
VOICE: And here I wonder...
DRUSILLA: What possible catastrophe came crashing down from heaven and brought this dashing stranger...
DRUSILLA: ...To tears?
SPIKE: Nothing. I wish to be alone.
DRUSILLA: You've been alone too long.
SPIKE: What could you possibly know of me?
DRUSILLA: I've seen you. A man surrounded by fools who cannot see his strength. His vision. His glory. That, and burning baby fish swimming all 'round your head.
SPIKE: Th-that's quite close enough. I've heard tales of London pickpockets. You'll not get my purse, I tell you.
DRUSILLA: Don't need a purse. Your wealth lies here. (touching his heart) And here. (touches his head) In the spirit and imagination. You walk in worlds the others can't begin to imagine.
SPIKE: Yes... I mean, no. I mean - Mother's expecting me.
DRUSILLA: I see what you want. Something glowing, and glistening. Something effulgent. Do you want it?
SPIKE: I - yes! God, yes!
SPIKE: Ow. Ow! OW! Ow ow ow ow OW-WOO!
WILLOW: Wow. So they really work <i>for</i> you?
XANDER: Well technically, they work for the construction company. But they are my crew. I tell them what to do, and they very often do it.
ANYA: Except sometimes they do it wrong and he gets to be all stern, but fair. It's so damn cute.
RILEY: Guys.
XANDER: Whatcha got?
RILEY: That's him.
RILEY: Let's go.
XANDER: Sounds like a party in there.
RILEY: Forget about crashing. There's too many of them.
WILLOW: Got a plan?
RILEY: We're leaving.
XANDER: I like this plan.
RILEY: We'll come back at daybreak when they're asleep and we're better armed. It's okay. We can kill 'em just as dead in the morning.
SPIKE: Nine in the side.
BUFFY: So you traded up on the food chain. Then what?
SPIKE: Nah, please, don't make it sound like something you'd flip past on the Discovery Channel. Becoming a vampire is a profound and powerful experience. I could feel this new strength coursing through me. Getting killed made me fill really alive for the very first time. I was through living by society's rules. Decided to make a few of my own. 'Course, in order to do that...
SPIKE: (through smoke) I had to get myself a gang.
ANGEL: Perhaps it's my advancing years that make me so forgetful, William. Remind me:
ANGEL: Why don't we kill you?
SPIKE: (choking) ...Ike...
ANGEL: What's that?
SPIKE: It's "Spike" now. You'd do well to remember it, mate.
ANGEL: I'm not your "mate." And when did you start talking like that?
DARLA: (to Spike) We barely got out of London alive, because of you. Everywhere we go, it's the same story. And now...
ANGEL: ...You've got me and my women hiding in the luxury of a mine shaft - all because William the Bloody likes attention. This is not a reputation we need.
SPIKE: I'm sorry, did I sully our good name? We're <i>vampires</i>.
ANGEL: All the more reason to use a certain amount of finesse.
SPIKE: Bollocks! That stuff's for the frilly cuffs and collars crowd. I'll take a good brawl any day.
ANGEL: And every time you do, we become the hunted.
DARLA: (sing-song) I think the boys are going to fi-ight.
DRUSILLA: The King of Cups expects a picnic, but this is not his birthday.
DARLA: (what?) Good... point.
SPIKE: Yeah, know what I prefer to being hunted? Getting caught.
ANGEL: That's brilliant strategy. Really, pure cunning.
SPIKE: Sod off. When's the last time you unleashed it? All out fighting a mob, back to the wall, nothing but fists and fangs? Don't you ever get tired of fights you know you're gonna win?
ANGEL: No. A real kill, a good kill - it takes an artistry. Without that, we're just animals.
SPIKE: Poofter.
SPIKE: <i>Now</i> you're getting it!
ANGEL: You can't keep this up forever. If I can't teach you, maybe someday an angry crowd will. That, or the Slayer.
SPIKE: What's a Slayer?
SPIKE: After that, I was obsessed. I mean, to most vampires, the Slayer was this object of cold sweat and frightened whispers. But I never hid. Hell, I sought her out. I mean, if you're looking for fun, there's Death, there's Glory, and sod all else, right? (shrugs) I was young.
BUFFY: So how'd you kill her?
SPIKE: Funny you should ask.
SPIKE: Lesson the first: a Slayer must always reach for a weapon.
SPIKE: I've already got mine.
SPIKE: Good thing, too. Become a vampire, there's nothing to fear. Nothing but one girl. That's you, honey. Back then...
SPIKE: ...It was her.
SPIKE: Just like I pictured. This good for you?
SLAYER: (Chinese with subtitles) Tell my mother... I'm sorry.
SPIKE: Sorry, Love. I don't speak Chinese.
SPIKE: (to himself) A fella could get used to this.
DRUSILLA: Ooh, Spike. Look at the wonderful mess you made.
DRUSILLA: Naughty, wicked Spike. That's a Slayer you've done in.
SPIKE: Suppose it is, yeah.
DRUSILLA: All by yourself?
SPIKE: Only way, innit?
SPIKE: …"Pet." Ever hear them say the blood of a Slayer is a powerful aphrodisiac?
DRUSILLA: That and the sound of a thousand little cherubs, crying their eyes out over all the spilled milk.
SPIKE: 'Course you do. Here now...
SPIKE: Have a taste.
DARLA: Where have you two been?
DRUSILLA: May I tell?
SPIKE: No need to be humble.
DRUSILLA: My Spikey's just killed a Slayer!
DARLA: What? (to Angel) Did you hear that?
ANGEL: (not pleased) Congratulations. I guess that makes you one of us.
SPIKE: Don't be so glum, mate. Way you tell it, one Slayer snuffs it, another one rises. I figure there's a new Chosen One, getting all chosen as we speak. Tell you what: if and when this new bird does show up - I give you first crack at her.
DRUSILLA: I smell fear --
ANGEL: This whole place reeks of it.
DRUSILLA: It's intoxicating.
ANGEL: Let's get out of here. This rebellion's starting to bore me.
SPIKE: And I've had some sweet ones.
SPIKE: What are you looking at?
BUFFY: You got off on it.
SPIKE: Well, <i>yeah</i>. Suppose you're telling me you don't? How many of my kind, reckon you've done?
BUFFY: Not enough.
SPIKE: And we just keep coming. Like a wave of roaches, and here you are doing a minute waltz, trying to stomp us all. But you can kill a hundred. A thousand. A thousand thousand and the armies of Hell besides. But all we need...
SPIKE: ...Is for one of us, just one, sooner or later, to have the thing we all are hoping for.
BUFFY: And that would be what?
SPIKE: (whisper) One. Good. Day
SPIKE: What? You asked and I'm telling. Problem with you, Summers is you've gotten so good, you're starting to think you're immortal.
BUFFY: No really. I just know I can handle myself.
SPIKE: Huh. Then how you explain <i>this</i>?
BUFFY: Aah!!
SPIKE: Aah!!
BUFFY: So that it? Lesson over?
SPIKE: Not even close.
ONE: So if you killed the Slayer, where's the body?
VAMP: Buried somewhere, surrounded by sobbing loved ones.
VAMP: Killed with her own weapon. They ought to put this in a museum.
VOICE: Know what they put in museums?
RILEY: Mostly dead things.
BUFFY: Give it to me.
BUFFY: What?
SPIKE: Lesson the second: ask the right questions. You want to know how I beat 'em.
SPIKE: The question isn't "how'd I win." The question is <u>why'd they lose</u>?
BUFFY: What's the difference?
SPIKE: There's a big difference, luv.
BUFFY: How'd you kill the second one?
SPIKE: Bit like this.
BUFFY: That didn't hurt?
SPIKE: Knew I couldn't touch you. If there's no intent to hurt you, then the chip they shoved up my brain never activates. If, on the other hand...
SPIKE: AHH!!
SPIKE: (laughing) See, now that hurt.
BUFFY: Yeah?
BUFFY: That hurt, too?
SPIKE: Oh, so good.
BUFFY: How 'bout that?
SPIKE: Definite pain there.
BUFFY: How'd you kill 'em, Spike?
SPIKE: You're not ready to know.
BUFFY: (firmly) I'm ready.
SPIKE: Okay then. Went like this:
SPIKE: The first one was all business. But the second - now she had a touch of your style.
SPIKE: Oh, yeah!
SPIKE: She was cunning, resourceful, and oh, did I mention? <i>Hot</i>. I could have danced all night with that one.
BUFFY: You think we're dancing?
SPIKE: It's all we've ever done.
SPIKE: Every day you wake up it's the same bloody question what haunts you: Is today the day I die? It's a warrior's pain, a warrior's question and you ask it...
SPIKE: (continued) ...every time the sun rises. And every day you manage to survive, you're only partly relieved because you know - it's just a matter of time.
SPIKE: Death is on your heels baby - and, sooner or later, it's going to catch you...
SPIKE: (continued) And some part of you <u>wants</u> it. Not only to stop the fear and the uncertainty - but because you're just a little bit in love with it.
SPIKE: Death is your art. You make it with your hands, day after day. That final gasp, that look of peace...
SPIKE: Part of you is desperate to know... What's it like? Where does it lead you? That's also a warrior's question. A warrior's curiosity.
SPIKE: So you see, that's the secret. Not the punch she didn't throw or the kick she didn't land. She simply wanted it. Every Slayer has a death wish.
SPIKE: Even you.
SPIKE: The only reason you've lasted as long as you have is, you've got ties to the world. Your Mum. Brat kid sister. Scoobies. They tie you here but you're just putting off the inevitable. Sooner or later, you're gonna want it and the second, the <i><u>second</u></i>...
SPIKE: ...that happens, I pray to God I'm there. I'll slip in - have myself a real good day.
SPIKE: Here endeth the lesson. I just wonder if you'll like it as much as she did-
BUFFY: (cutting him off) <u>No</u>. This is all- You're wrong.
SPIKE: Hey. You asked. Sorry if the answer isn't cuddly enough for you-
BUFFY: (deadly) Get out of my sight, Spike. Now.
SPIKE: Ooooh, did I scare you? You're the Slayer. Do something about it. Hit me.
SPIKE: Come on. One good swing. You know you want to.
BUFFY: I mean it-
SPIKE: So do I. Give it to me good, Buffy. Do it.
BUFFY: Spike-
BUFFY: Spike...
BUFFY: What the hell are you doing?!
SPIKE: (still holding her) Come on. I can feel it, Slayer. You know you want to dance.
BUFFY: Say it's true. Say I do want to...
BUFFY: It wouldn't be you, Spike. It would never be <u>you</u>.
BUFFY: You're beneath me.
HARMONY: Spike? What are you doing?
SPIKE: (muttering) Beneath me, I'll show her, put her six bloody feet beneath me...
SPIKE: Hasn't got a death wish?
SPIKE: The bitch won't need one.
HARMONY: Okay, I'm trying to be supportive here, so don't drive a stake through my heart like last time, but...
HARMONY: ...You can't kill Buffy. She's the Slayer. She is so gonna kick your ass.
SPIKE: Got two barrels here that'll prove you wrong.
HARMONY: Tch! I knew you'd take it personally. You're so sensitive.
HARMONY: How are you going to kill her? Think. The second you even point that thing at her you're gonna be all... (Spike imitation) "Aaah!" and then you'll get bitch-slapped up and down Main Street unless she's had enough and just stakes you.
SPIKE: This is different. Move.
HARMONY: No! And then you'll come back to me and stomp around and swear a bunch of weird English curses.
SPIKE: (losing patience) Harm...
HARMONY: What is a "bollock," anyway?
SPIKE: Yeah, it'll hurt like hell for about two hours.
SPIKE: And she'll be dead just a little longer than that.
HARMONY: Fine. But don't come crying to me when you fail. You couldn't kill her <u>before</u> you got the chip! You had plenty of chances...
SPIKE: So, Sunnyhell was not our finest hour. And yes, I made a deal with the Slayer. But you were shagging Angel <i>and</i> bringing about an Apocalypse to end all life as we know it. So? Every couple's got their ups and downs, Love. Point being, we got through all that, it's behind us now. Isn't it?
DRUSILLA: I hate it here. Furry little animals peering at us from out of the trees, and the people all taste funny.
SPIKE: Right. We'll pick up and move again, and we'll keep moving 'til we've found the perfect spot, and there I'll make you my queen.
SPIKE: Just tell me what you want.
DRUSILLA: I want the Slayer dead, Spike.
SPIKE: You're the one who keeps bringing her up! I haven't said a word about the bloody Slayer since we left California! She's on the other side of the planet, Dru! Gone from our lives forever!
DRUSILLA: But you're lying, I can still see her. Floating all around you. Laughing. Why don't you push her away?
SPIKE: But I did, Pet. I did if for you! And you're still punishing me, you think I don't know what's going on with you?
DEMON: Okay. You guys obviously have a thing going on here.
DRUSILLA: I have to find my pleasures, Spike. You taste like ashes.
SPIKE: This is my fault now?
DEMON: I didn't know she was seeing someone... I should take off.
SPIKE: Yeah, why don't you do that?
DRUSILLA: You can't blame a girl, Spike, you're all covered with her. I look at you, all I see is the Slayer.
BUFFY: Hey Mom, I put together that grocery list for you...
JOYCE: Oh. Great. Thanks, hon.
BUFFY: Are you okay?
JOYCE: Fine. You seen my conditioner?
BUFFY: Look under the sink?
BUFFY: Where you going?
JOYCE: Okay. I'd love to put this off, but... (big breath) You know that "nothing" I've been dealing with, the past couple of weeks?
JOYCE: It might not be nothing.
BUFFY: What is it?
JOYCE: I'm staying overnight at the hospital for observation. I'm getting a cat scan.
JOYCE: It's only one day. And they say if there is anything it's still very early if they didn't see it before. I'm gonna be fine.
BUFFY: I know you will.
BUFFY: What is it now?
SPIKE: What's wrong?
BUFFY: I don't want to talk about it.
SPIKE: Is there something I can do?
