What happened?
(sarcastic) Oh yeah. I like a girl who can play a few hard sets of tennis with a major stab wound.
I said I've seen worse. There's a difference.
I still think you need to see a real doctor.
If our positions were reversed...
So tell me about the bad guy. Or, guys. What do you think they were?
How many?
So, what, he was like some kind of Super Vampire or something?
That's scary.
That ever happen before?
Mrs. Summers. How are you feeling?
Glad to hear it.
So. Dawn takes household duty. I'll pick up tonight's patrol.
It's just a sweep.
I'll be okay.
You forgot "manipulative."
Okay. I'll patrol tonight with the group.
It means yell real loud so the vampires who don't know we're coming will have a sporting chance.
Um, guys? I'm thinking we could cover more ground if we split up. Tell you what: I'll cover the cemeteries - you take the Bronze.
Just... ditch the chips, watch my back.
Guys.
That's him.
Let's go.
Forget about crashing. There's too many of them.
We're leaving.
We'll come back at daybreak when they're asleep and we're better armed. It's okay. We can kill 'em just as dead in the morning.
Mostly dead things.
