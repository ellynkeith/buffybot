Everyone stay close. (to Xander) Glad you called me in on this.
Oh, yeah. Sorry 'bout last time. Heard I missed out on some fun.
There, look. There it is.
It's not hot. It's... broken. And... sort of...
No pulse.
I'm not sure. There's somethingâ€¦
It might be toxic, don't touch it.
(almost to himself) This is definitely new territory.
Yeah, I think that's a good call. There  could have been some other cases like  this. And see if any more of these  were reported in town. I'm gonna  stay here, examine the body some  more, look around a little.
No, no. I'm just not great at research,  which I'm pretty sure you guys have  noticed. I like me a good crime scene.
Believe me, something jumps out at me  in the dark... you'll hear me even without  the phone. Now, you guys go get that info,  okay? Call me if you find anything.
Yeah.
That I know of. Over here.
I wouldn't touch that stuff in his mouth if I were you.
No. Just messy.
Don't think it's toxic. Guy seems to have  simply choked on the stuff. Near as I can  tell, it's some kind of protein alkaloid.
Not a sub-terrestrial, Major. <u>Extra</u>-terrestrial. (pointing) Came out of that.
No good, Major. This alkaloid's breaking  down at an accelerated rate. It's dissolving  too fast to track.
Thing came from space... there's gotta  be some trace radiation.
Shouldn't be too much background gamma noise out here.
A Queller demon?
'Cause I got five corpses here in the mental ward at Sunnydale Memorial.
It's okay. Joyce was released earlier today.  That intern Ben told me. They're safe at home.
We-- I think I've got it cornered in the  air ducts. Look, Willow... Keep at what  you're doing. Call me if you find out  how I can kill this thing.
A car. It hitched a ride. Probably underneath.  So much for containment.
Checked out today...
(cutting him off) No. I know where it's going.
We've got to move. <u>Now</u>.
(to Buffy) Are you okay?
