I guess I missed that. Was he bothering you?
Hi.
Don't get me started. The Mental  Ward's booked way past capacity at  this point. Literally nowhere to put 'em.  So the ones with families, they're sending  'em home. Like that guy's family's s'posed  to be able to take care of him? He needs  someone to watch him twenty-four seven. (then) What was he saying to you anyway?
Get out.
Why do you think? Because I'm cleaning  up Glory's mess. Just like I've done my  whole damn life.
