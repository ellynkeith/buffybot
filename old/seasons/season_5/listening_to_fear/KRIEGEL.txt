Yes, of course. You two are becoming  part of the regular crew around here.
Good for you. Just be careful you don't wear her out.
Well, maybe some good news will  help. The bloodwork has come back  from the lab and everything seems fine.  So, we've gone ahead and scheduled  your surgery for the day after  tomorrow at ten in the a.m. How does  that sound to you?
Alright then. Joyce, you take care.  Make sure to get some good solid rest.  And I mean that.
Well, of course. You can come back  and visit your mother first thing in the  morning.
Oh, well, I understand that. But it's not  necessarily the first thing I'd recommend--
Joyce, there's no reason to get upset--
Even if it would mean some work for you? Taking care of her.
There are medications to administer, I'd  have to go over those with you. And  I'd need you to check her vitals, watch  her pretty closely... I'm afraid you won't  get a lot of sleep.
(to Joyce) She's right. Let's do this right. We don't want to forget anything.
Well, I guess we're all set then. You've  got my phone number, pager number ...  And here ...
Those are the medications I talked to you  about. The sedative and so forth. Pain killers ...
If this is going to be too much for you, we can make your mom perfectly comfortable here ...
I know.
Joyce? Joyce.
We're done here. Why don't you take  your girls home now?
I'll see you in a couple of days.
