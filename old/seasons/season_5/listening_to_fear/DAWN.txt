And I like the Jell-O.
This girl at school? She told me that  gelatin is made from ground-up cow's feet and that every time you eat Jell-O  there's some cow out there limping  around without any feet. But I told  her that I'm sure the cow is dead  before they cut its feet off, right?
Yeah, we've got soap operas to watch  and trashy magazines to read ...
What's that, a vacuum cleaner?
Spells! Wow, cool. Thanks Willow.
What was she talking about? I mean, that was weird.
Does she know she's saying it?
(to Buffy) Is that right?
Buffy?
What's wrong with him? Is it like Mom? A thing in his head?
Do you want to get in bed, Mom?
Sure.
What - -
M-Mom, please--
She hates me ...
She-- she called me a thing.
No, not just Mom. People. They keep  saying stuff like that... about me.
He-- He called me "a thing," too. And  there was another one. A weird guy,  outside the magic shop. Said I didn't  belong... I wasn't real ...
Why does everybody keep doing that? What's wrong with me?
So, what's wrong with <u>your</u> brain?
You said stuff, too. Said I-- I wasn't  your sister--
I hate it.
Buffy! Buffy!
(with all her strength) BUFFY! !
It's gone? You promise?
