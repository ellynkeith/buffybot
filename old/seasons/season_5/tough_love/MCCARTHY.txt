Benjamin, this is a pleasant surprise.
You're not late.
You can't be late to a job you don't have. Interestingly enough, I've decided to give your job to someone who'd actually do it.
Honest to God Ben, I've been calling you for two weeks. Where the hell have you been? I didn't want to... I'm sorry to fire you, but I need someone I can count on.
Sure. You can also tell me that the dog ate your homework; or maybe eating Twinkies made you do it; or maybe, yeah, that there's a really wicked demonic creature living inside you that takes control of your body and forces you to do its bidding. (then) Take responsibility for your actions, Ben.
Ben, wait.
I'm going to need to ask you for your ID Badge.
Unfortunately, no. Hospital policy dictates we keep her for the night.
(kind) Is she your sister?
Well, you can get her released first thing in the morning. But she's got to spend one night in the psych ward, just for observation. We'll keep an eye on her, do a couple basic tests and then you take her home. Does that sound fair?
Well, you hold tight then, and I'll send a nurse by in a few minutes to pick up Tara.
