Well, it's understandable...
Sweetie, you wouldn't blow off class if your head was on fire. And I meant Buffy.
Understandable. About the crabby; I mean she has to look after Dawn now.
(overlapping slightly) I had to deal with my brother's problems after, I mean -- you really can't know what it's like to--
I didn't mean--
I made you mad.
All I meant was that--
No, please, if I... I mean, tell me if I said something wrong. Otherwise I know I'll say it again, probably often and in public.
Well I'm not the expert, I mean, I only lost one... Do I act like I'm the big Knowledge Woman?
Is that "no" spelled Y-E-S?
--Oh but you're way beyond me there. In just a few -- I mean it frightens me how powerful you're getting.

With my life!
Can't we just go the fair?
It's not that. I worry. Sometimes... You're changing so much, so fast, I don't know... where you're heading...
I'm saying everything wrong.
I trust you. I just... I don't know where I'm gonna fit in. In your life, when --
Should I?
Willow, please--
I didn't--

It has to be verified of course. Anyone could tell you that. Of course. Of course.
They kill mice.
Don't... please don't with that treachery. I told the cats. And now I beg my mother, sitting all alone.
Plastic and their six sisters. Six sick sisters. Willow?
No! The place is cracking, cracking. No, no, no...
Look at that... the light,  it's so pure... (pointing at Dawn) Such a pure green energy. It's so beautiful.
