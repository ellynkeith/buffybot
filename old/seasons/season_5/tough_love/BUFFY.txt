Um, Professor Lillian?
No. I'm sorry I missed the lecture. Was it good? I mean, I'm sure it was...
Want me to try?
I actually just came by to tell you that I have to drop this class. All my classes. I'm not finishing the semester.
I'm sorry. I wish... but I can't be in school now. I've got to take care of my sister.
Um, so I have these forms from the Registrar's office that I need you to sign...
Thanks.
Oh no. Yes. Actually, yeah. I wanted to tell you how much I loved this class. It's like, in the middle of all this, I'm paranoid that you'll think I don't like poetry.
I mean, I know I wasn't the best student. But I learned a lot. And I really like poetry.
(chagrined) I really do.
You know, I wish I had time for it. But I don't, I just don't right now.
Yeah, like those Japanese ones, you know, that sound like a sneeze?
Right, maybe those. And hopefully I'll be back next semester.
You lied to me, Dawn?
Oh, yeah? What about all the times I asked you how school was and you said, "fine."
(to the Principal) I don't know what to say. I guess you probably know it's been a really hard time for Dawn these last few months and not that that's an excuse--
It is. For Dawn, especially. I mean, she's just a kid.
Look, I realize there's been some ball dropping, but I'm sure this'll all--
Hey, everybody.
Yep. I'm all dropped out.
Well, this is just for now. I'm thinking I'll probably go back next semester.
Thanks. Actually, I need to speak to Giles alone for a minute.
Um, Dawn, why don't you get started on your homework, okay? If you need help... (to Willow) Will, could you...?
I don't know what to do... She's messing up. <u>I'm</u> messing up. It's... a mess.
I try. My foot's not used to being put down. (then) I want you to do it. Can't <u>you</u> be the foot-putting-downer?
Please? Pretty please? C'mon, your feet are way bigger than mine! I mean, you're so much more a grown-up than me. She needs an authority figure, a strong guiding hand. She'll listen to you--
I listen.
I do.
Right. She needs me.
Me the grown up. Me the authority figure. The guiding hand and stompy foot that is me.
Okay, I can do this.
(a plea) Please?
(sucking it up) Right. Here we go.
Early to bed, early to rise; balanced breakfasts; hospital corners; museum visits. It's a new beginning: discipline, authority...
Order...?
What is this?
Dawn, I thought I told you to do your homework.
Please don't lie to me.
Uh-huh.
Right. Well, you know what? I think maybe Dawn should do her geometry at home.
Go get your stuff.
It's really important Dawn finishes her school work right now.
Look. I know you mean well but you just don't understand. And there's no way you could.
I'm more than stressed out. I'm freaked out.
Nah, I don't think so.
Can't do it Will. But don't worry. It's not like I don't have a life. I do. I have Dawn's life. (to Dawn) You ready?
Okay, so I think the next step is to make a chart. A schedule. I'll write down all the things you're supposed to do and when you have to do them and there'll be a box for everything and you can make a big x in it when you're accomplished your task.
What? You want gold stars, you can have gold stars--
I'm just trying to give you a normal life.
This is for real, Dawn.
It's not a graph. It's a chart. And you are real.
Dammit, Dawn, this is serious!
Because they'll take you away!
They'll take you away from me. That's what your principal told me when you weren't in the room. If I can't make you go to school, I won't be found fit to be your legal guardian.
I don't... Dad, maybe? Or foster care? I didn't... I didn't really want to ask.
I just did.
Will. I'm so sorry.
Tara.
(to Willow) I'm sorry it took me so long. But I'm here now and Dawn's safe with Spike so I can stay as long as you need me.
Will, you just have to rest. Right now there's nothing you can do.
No. No way...
You can't even think about taking on Glory.
No, you <u>have to</u> let her get away with it. Even I'm no match for her, you know that.
You're not. And I won't let you go.
This is not the time.
No. When we have a chance. We'll fight her when we have a chance.
You wouldn't last five minutes Willow. She's a god.
It's the only choice.
Can I do anything--
They said there's no way of knowing right now.
(softly) Dawn honey... Tara might not either.
It's <u>not</u> your fault.
She was looking to go all paybacky on Glory for a minute there, but I cooled her down a little. (shrugs) Actually, a lot.
I explained, you know, there was no point.
What?
(realizing) You think she'd...? No. I told Willow, fighting Glory'd be suicide...
They used to bow down to gods.
Things change.
Chicken salad?
Eggplant, that's me. And, what is this, peanut butter and... ew, <u>salami</u>, Dawn?
What are you gonna need?
I'm sorry I couldn't have...
I understand.
