(petulant) I'm hungry.
Ahh. They got this part right., that's for sure. Lot of sucky things in this dimension. Bubble baths? Not one of them, know what I mean?
I wasn't talking to you.
Ew! Yeah, right. Like any of you have ever bathed anyway.
How about you shut up and listen to me, you disgusting little fools. Okay, now I asked for the Key, and you brought me a vampire. A pulseless, impure, follicley-fried vampire. Loofah.
Now, what I think we have here is a failure... FOR YOU TO DO YOUR FRIGGIN' JOBS. Pardon my French. Mimosa.
Mmm, vitamins! So, I think you better rack your little Minion brains and tell me everything that you saw when you were spying on Buffy and her wacky pals. Everything. Then <u>I'll</u> figure out who the Key is.
So it's her. Under our noses all this time. I like the detail work those monks did. Quirks, foibles, passions. It's all so cute, so human, ya know? Pretty convincing really. But not convincing enough.
You all know your assignments. I think it's time to collect the Key.
This seat taken?
This is nice. Just hanging out. Just us girls.
(re: handholding) You like this sort of thing, don't you?
(soft and horrible) Don't make a sound.
Nuh-uh. They won't help you.
I'd kill them. You know that. There's no one here that can stop me.
I'll kill her. And them. And I'll kill him. And him. And her. And it'll be all your fault.
It's kind of funny, isn't it? All these people here and nobody who can do a thing. Not a person who can help you. That's people for you; pretty worthless.
But Keys on the other hand... Keys are worth a very lot.
You lying little tramp. You're not the Key. You're nothing. Just another worthless human being.
I <u>hate</u> being lied to. It makes me feel so betrayed!
Hey! Do you want to make it all better? If you tell me who the KEY really is I'll let you go. Think about it. You think your hand hurts? Imagine what you'll feel with my fingers wiggling in your brain.
It doesn't kill you. What it does is make you feel like you're in a noisy little dark room. Naked, and ashamed. And there are things in the dark that need to hurt you 'cause you're bad. Little pinching things that go in your ears and crawl on the inside of your skull. And you know that if the noise and the crawling would stop, you could remember how to get out. But you never ever will.
Who is the Key?
Fine.
Too summery, too power-suit, eugh, way too nineties, and... oh.
What do you think? (beat) For just a basic show up and slaughter your enemies thing.
Good point.
You know, I think I'm a little buzzed from eating that witch. What a mind she had. Nummy treat.
What, about the Slayer? Don't be stupid. I know I'm closing in. The Key's as good as mine. Girl like Buffy's got just so many friends. All I gotta do is rip through 'em, one by one, until I finally...
Did anybody order an apocalypse?
(realizing) It's the lover. (then) That's so cute.
(laughing) Is that it? Is that the best you can do?
You think I care about all this? The apartment, the clothes...
I don't give a rat's ass when it comes right down to it.
Sucking on your girlfriend's mind, now that was something to treasure.
What's this? Bag of tricks?
Now this is getting weak...
And so are you, honey.
Aren't you?
You're going to regret that.
You know what they used to do to witches, Lover?
Crucify 'em.
This isn't over.
I told you this wasn't over.
