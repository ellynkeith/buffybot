Didn't lie, exactly...
Well it was! You didn't ask if I was <u>in</u> it... (smaller) when it was fine...
Hi.
I <u>was</u>.
I'm not.
But it was working. I was really learning--
(under her breath) Fine, don't listen to me.
I don't want gold stars. I don't want any of this.
Well, good luck.
What? What am I doing wrong now?
No, it isn't. I'm not real, so why would my exciting graph of chores be real? Who cares if a Key gets an education anyway?
Yeah? Those Monks put grades K through Eight in my head. Can't we just wait and see if they drop Nine in there too?
Why? Why should I care about any of this?
Take me away? What do you mean?
Where would I go?
You could've told me that.
Oh yeah, the same no one who did that to you?
Worse?
You want to know what I'm scared of, Spike?
Me. Right now, Glory thinks Tara's the Key. But <u>I'm</u> the Key, Spike. <u>I</u> am. And anything that happens to Tara is 'cause of me.
Your bruises, your limp... That's all me, too. I'm like a lightning rod for pain and hurt... and everyone around me suffers... and... (tearing up) And dies. I... This stupid Key must be something horrible... to cause so much... evil.
What do you know?
Maybe, maybe not. Maybe I'm not evil but I don't think I can be good.
So, what'd the doctors say? Is Tara... like those guys in the mental ward, or, is it different somehow?
'Cause... none of those guys got better. I mean, none of them.
It's all my fault.
How's Willow?
Think, Buffy. If Glory'd done that to me...
Yeah, like eggplant is normal. It's what - half-egg, half-plant? 'Cause that's just unnatural.
I got her tuna. Does she like... Tara, you like Tuna?
Can I help?
Tara, it's okay. It's okay.
