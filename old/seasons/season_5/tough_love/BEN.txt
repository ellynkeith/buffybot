I'm sorry I'm late.
(looking at his watch) But sir--
I haven't been here... (realizing) I haven't been here in two weeks. (to the Doctor) There's an explanation for this. (a beat) Which I can't exactly give you. I... can I just tell you it's not my fault?
I...I...this. Forget it. Just forget it.
Take it. It's worthless anyway.
This is so unfair. You're taking everything away from me. Everything that I worked for. I earned. I care about. These are my choices. This is my life, and you're ruining it.
No...no...not here...not now. Please.
(a mantra) I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben!
I'M BEN! I'M BEN! I'M BEN!
