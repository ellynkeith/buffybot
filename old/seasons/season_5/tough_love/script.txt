BUFFY: Um, Professor Lillian?
LILLIAN: Sitting in the back today, Buffy?
BUFFY: No. I'm sorry I missed the lecture. Was it good? I mean, I'm sure it was...
BUFFY: Want me to try?
LILLIAN: Thanks. The cartridge is struck.
BUFFY: I actually just came by to tell you that I have to drop this class. All my classes. I'm not finishing the semester.
BUFFY: I'm sorry. I wish... but I can't be in school now. I've got to take care of my sister.
LILLIAN: I thought you might... I was sorry to hear of your loss.
BUFFY: Um, so I have these forms from the Registrar's office that I need you to sign...
LILLIAN: Seems like they're trying to make it harder to get out of college than to get in.
BUFFY: Thanks.
LILLIAN: Is there something else?
BUFFY: Oh no. Yes. Actually, yeah. I wanted to tell you how much I loved this class. It's like, in the middle of all this, I'm paranoid that you'll think I don't like poetry.
BUFFY: I mean, I know I wasn't the best student. But I learned a lot. And I really like poetry.
BUFFY: (chagrined) I really do.
LILLIAN: (re: slide projector) We'll let the AV guys hand that. I'm glad you like poetry, Buffy.
BUFFY: You know, I wish I had time for it. But I don't, I just don't right now.
LILLIAN: Maybe short poems?
BUFFY: Yeah, like those Japanese ones, you know, that sound like a sneeze?
LILLIAN: Haiku?
BUFFY: Right, maybe those. And hopefully I'll be back next semester.
LILLIAN: I hope so.
MCCARTHY: Benjamin, this is a pleasant surprise.
BEN: I'm sorry I'm late.
MCCARTHY: You're not late.
BEN: (looking at his watch) But sir--
MCCARTHY: You can't be late to a job you don't have. Interestingly enough, I've decided to give your job to someone who'd actually do it.
MCCARTHY: Honest to God Ben, I've been calling you for two weeks. Where the hell have you been? I didn't want to... I'm sorry to fire you, but I need someone I can count on.
BEN: I haven't been here... (realizing) I haven't been here in two weeks. (to the Doctor) There's an explanation for this. (a beat) Which I can't exactly give you. I... can I just tell you it's not my fault?
MCCARTHY: Sure. You can also tell me that the dog ate your homework; or maybe eating Twinkies made you do it; or maybe, yeah, that there's a really wicked demonic creature living inside you that takes control of your body and forces you to do its bidding. (then) Take responsibility for your actions, Ben.
BEN: I...I...this. Forget it. Just forget it.
MCCARTHY: Ben, wait.
MCCARTHY: I'm going to need to ask you for your ID Badge.
BEN: Take it. It's worthless anyway.
BEN: This is so unfair. You're taking everything away from me. Everything that I worked for. I earned. I care about. These are my choices. This is my life, and you're ruining it.
BEN: No...no...not here...not now. Please.
BEN: (a mantra) I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben!
BEN: I'M BEN! I'M BEN! I'M BEN!
GLORY: (petulant) I'm hungry.
GLORY: Ahh. They got this part right., that's for sure. Lot of sucky things in this dimension. Bubble baths? Not one of them, know what I mean?
JINX: I am in most thunderous agreement, oh glittering, glistening Glorificus
GLORY: I wasn't talking to you.
MURK: (nervous) Begging your pardon, and begging in general, but were you talking to me?
GLORY: Ew! Yeah, right. Like any of you have ever bathed anyway.
MURK: Oh, but we do, your Scrumptiousness. We bathe in your splendiferous radiance, your aromatic--
GLORY: How about you shut up and listen to me, you disgusting little fools. Okay, now I asked for the Key, and you brought me a vampire. A pulseless, impure, follicley-fried vampire. Loofah.
GLORY: Now, what I think we have here is a failure... FOR YOU TO DO YOUR FRIGGIN' JOBS. Pardon my French. Mimosa.
GLORY: Mmm, vitamins! So, I think you better rack your little Minion brains and tell me everything that you saw when you were spying on Buffy and her wacky pals. Everything. Then <u>I'll</u> figure out who the Key is.
BUFFY: You lied to me, Dawn?
DAWN: Didn't lie, exactly...
BUFFY: Oh, yeah? What about all the times I asked you how school was and you said, "fine."
DAWN: Well it was! You didn't ask if I was <u>in</u> it... (smaller) when it was fine...
BUFFY: (to the Principal) I don't know what to say. I guess you probably know it's been a really hard time for Dawn these last few months and not that that's an excuse--
STEVENS: I understand. Your mother was a lovely woman and we'll all miss her very much. (beat) I know how difficult it must be.
BUFFY: It is. For Dawn, especially. I mean, she's just a kid.
STEVENS: Hmmm. Well... (eyes back on Buffy) I think we both know that Dawn is a lot more than "just a kid."
STEVENS: She's a talented young girl with a sharp mind. (looking at Dawn) When she puts the effort in.
BUFFY: Look, I realize there's been some ball dropping, but I'm sure this'll all--
STEVENS: Dawn. Why don't you wait outside for a few minutes.
XANDER: Honey, old saying: "A watched customer never buys."
ANYA: They would if they were patriotic.
XANDER: Okay, I'm going in. (to Anya) <i>Patriotic</i>?
ANYA: Yes. I've recently come to realize there's more to me than just being human. I'm also an American.
GILES: I suppose you are, in a matter of speaking. You <u>were</u> born here. Your mortal self.
ANYA: That's right, foreigner. So I've been reading a lot about the good ol' US of A, embracing the extraordinarily precious ideology that helped to shape and define it.
WILLOW: Democracy.
ANYA: Capitalism. A free market dependent on the profitable exchange of goods for currency. A system of symbiotic beauty apparently lost on these old people. Look at them.
ANYA: Perusing the shelves, undressing the merchandise with their eyeballs... all ogle, no cash. It's not just annoying, it's un-American.
GILES: (looking over at them) Yes, appalling. Almost as if they no longer think money can buy happiness.
ANYA: Totally. Un-American. And you know what else is un-American? French people.
WILLOW: You don't say.
ANYA: From what I hear, they don't tip. French old people, that's really the bottom of the barrel, huh?
XANDER: Ahn, how 'bout we try being a bit less prejudiced and a bit more inclusive? (then, indicating him and Willow) Not <u>us</u>, just you.
ANYA: Fine. (then) I'm going to make those fogies buy things.
XANDER: Hey, what's up? It's Dawn Giovanni and the Buffster.
DAWN: Hi.
BUFFY: Hey, everybody.
GILES: (to Buffy) So all went well at the university, I trust.
BUFFY: Yep. I'm all dropped out.
XANDER: Good on you. Welcome to the real world.
WILLOW: Why do people who don't go to college always refer to everything outside of college as the "real world"? Like college is some imaginary realm with elves and witches and... (thinks about it) Huh.
XANDER: (to Buffy) Lotta fun to be had on the outside. You'll see.
BUFFY: Well, this is just for now. I'm thinking I'll probably go back next semester.
XANDER: And that's cool too. Whatever you choose, you've got my support. Just think of me as...as your... (then) You know, I'm searching for 'supportive things' and I'm coming up all bras. So. Something slightly more manly preferably, think of me as that. Seriously, whatever you need.
BUFFY: Thanks. Actually, I need to speak to Giles alone for a minute.
XANDER: Cool. That's cool.
GILES: Willow, mind watching the till?
WILLOW: Not at all.
BUFFY: Um, Dawn, why don't you get started on your homework, okay? If you need help... (to Willow) Will, could you...?
BUFFY: I don't know what to do... She's messing up. <u>I'm</u> messing up. It's... a mess.
GILES: You're going to have to put your foot down with her.
BUFFY: I try. My foot's not used to being put down. (then) I want you to do it. Can't <u>you</u> be the foot-putting-downer?
GILES: No, Buffy, I don't think so.
BUFFY: Please? Pretty please? C'mon, your feet are way bigger than mine! I mean, you're so much more a grown-up than me. She needs an authority figure, a strong guiding hand. She'll listen to you--
GILES: Just like you always have?
BUFFY: I listen.
BUFFY: I do.
GILES: Then perk up your ears. I may be a grown-up, but you're her family. Her only real family now. She needs you to do this.
BUFFY: Right. She needs me.
BUFFY: Me the grown up. Me the authority figure. The guiding hand and stompy foot that is me.
GILES: That's the spirit.
BUFFY: Okay, I can do this.
GILES: I know you can.
BUFFY: (a plea) Please?
GILES: (kind) No.
BUFFY: (sucking it up) Right. Here we go.
BUFFY: Early to bed, early to rise; balanced breakfasts; hospital corners; museum visits. It's a new beginning: discipline, authority...
BUFFY: Order...?
BUFFY: What is this?
BUFFY: Dawn, I thought I told you to do your homework.
DAWN: I <u>was</u>.
BUFFY: Please don't lie to me.
DAWN: I'm not.
WILLOW: We were acting out a geometry problem. 'Cause I just read this really neat article that said kids learn math better when you tap into their visual learning patterns; you know, using the right brain too, instead of just the left and stuff like that--
BUFFY: Uh-huh.
WILLOW: So we made a triangle with our bodies. And that's when I called Xander 'obtuse' and he got all grumpy and then Dawn said we were 'acute' triangle and, well... hilarity ensued.
BUFFY: Right. Well, you know what? I think maybe Dawn should do her geometry at home.
DAWN: But it was working. I was really learning--
BUFFY: Go get your stuff.
DAWN: (under her breath) Fine, don't listen to me.
WILLOW: (to Buffy, trying to lighten the moment) Don't get all grouchy at her... Who among us can ignore the allure of really funny math puns?
BUFFY: It's really important Dawn finishes her school work right now.
WILLOW: I know it is. And I'm a big fan of school. You know me, I'm all: 'Go school, it's your birthday'! Or something to that effect.
BUFFY: Look. I know you mean well but you just don't understand. And there's no way you could.
WILLOW: I do so understand. You're stressed out--
BUFFY: I'm more than stressed out. I'm freaked out.
WILLOW: Yeah. Well, maybe you need a little break to de-freak. You could come to the World Culture Fair, if you want, with me and Tara.
BUFFY: Nah, I don't think so.
WILLOW: C'mon, you could bring Dawn and it could be really fun. I mean educational- type fun, in a discipliney sort of way. Supposedly the highlights last year were baked sushi and some inexperienced yogis who tried to walk on burning coals and--
BUFFY: Can't do it Will. But don't worry. It's not like I don't have a life. I do. I have Dawn's life. (to Dawn) You ready?
GLORY: So it's her. Under our noses all this time. I like the detail work those monks did. Quirks, foibles, passions. It's all so cute, so human, ya know? Pretty convincing really. But not convincing enough.
GLORY: You all know your assignments. I think it's time to collect the Key.
WILLOW: It wasn't anything, really; Buffy was just being kinda crabby at Dawn about her schoolwork.
TARA: Well, it's understandable...
WILLOW: Sure it is! I'd totally be blowing off classes if I was in Dawnie's shoes.
TARA: Sweetie, you wouldn't blow off class if your head was on fire. And I meant Buffy.
WILLOW: Buffy what?
TARA: Understandable. About the crabby; I mean she has to look after Dawn now.
WILLOW: Yeah, but not in a 'Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for Girls' way, I mean she'll just make Dawn even more rebellious--
TARA: (overlapping slightly) I had to deal with my brother's problems after, I mean -- you really can't know what it's like to--
WILLOW: (defensively) I know that.
TARA: I didn't mean--
WILLOW: No, I just, I mean I know I can't know what you went through, I just... It's no big.
TARA: I made you mad.
WILLOW: No, no...
TARA: All I meant was that--
WILLOW: --It's okay, the whole Buffy thing just -- Forget it.
TARA: No, please, if I... I mean, tell me if I said something wrong. Otherwise I know I'll say it again, probably often and in public.
WILLOW: No, I was snippy gal, it's just... I know I can't, on some level... it's like my opinion isn't worth anything because I haven't been through... I didn't lose my mom, so I don't know...
TARA: Well I'm not the expert, I mean, I only lost one... Do I act like I'm the big Knowledge Woman?
WILLOW: No...
TARA: Is that "no" spelled Y-E-S?
WILLOW: S-O-R-T of... it's just... I mean I just feel like the junior partner sometimes, you've been doing everything longer than me, you've been out longer, and practicing witchcraft way longer--
TARA: --Oh but you're way beyond me there. In just a few -- I mean it frightens me how powerful you're getting.
WILLOW: That's a weird word.
TARA: (knows damn well) "Getting"?
WILLOW: It frightens you? I frighten you?
TARA: That's so not what I mean. I meant impresses, impressive...
WILLOW: Well I took Psyche 101 -- I mean, I took it from an evil government scientist who was skewered by her Frankenstein-like creation right before the final -- but I know what a Freudian slip is. (beat) Don't you trust me?
TARA: With my life!
WILLOW: That's not what I mean.
TARA: Can't we just go the fair?
WILLOW: I'm not feeling real multicultural right now. What is it about me that you don't trust?
TARA: It's not that. I worry. Sometimes... You're changing so much, so fast, I don't know... where you're heading...
WILLOW: Where I'm heading?
TARA: I'm saying everything wrong.
WILLOW: (vulnerable) I think you're being pretty clear. It isn't the witch thing -- this is about the <u>other</u> changes in my life.
TARA: I trust you. I just... I don't know where I'm gonna fit in. In your life, when --
WILLOW: When I 'change back'? Yeah, this is just a college thing, just a little experimentation before I get over the thrill and head back to boys' town. You think that?
TARA: Should I?
WILLOW: You know, I'm really sorry I didn't establish my lesbo street cred before I got into this relationship. But you're the only woman I've ever fallen in love with, so how on earth could you possibly take me seriously?
TARA: Willow, please--
WILLOW: Have fun at the fair.
BUFFY: Okay, so I think the next step is to make a chart. A schedule. I'll write down all the things you're supposed to do and when you have to do them and there'll be a box for everything and you can make a big x in it when you're accomplished your task.
BUFFY: What? You want gold stars, you can have gold stars--
DAWN: I don't want gold stars. I don't want any of this.
BUFFY: I'm just trying to give you a normal life.
DAWN: Well, good luck.
DAWN: What? What am I doing wrong now?
BUFFY: This is for real, Dawn.
DAWN: No, it isn't. I'm not real, so why would my exciting graph of chores be real? Who cares if a Key gets an education anyway?
BUFFY: It's not a graph. It's a chart. And you are real.
DAWN: Yeah? Those Monks put grades K through Eight in my head. Can't we just wait and see if they drop Nine in there too?
BUFFY: Dammit, Dawn, this is serious!
DAWN: Why? Why should I care about any of this?
BUFFY: Because they'll take you away!
DAWN: Take me away? What do you mean?
BUFFY: They'll take you away from me. That's what your principal told me when you weren't in the room. If I can't make you go to school, I won't be found fit to be your legal guardian.
DAWN: Where would I go?
BUFFY: I don't... Dad, maybe? Or foster care? I didn't... I didn't really want to ask.
DAWN: You could've told me that.
BUFFY: I just did.
GLORY: This seat taken?
GILES: I hope this isn't another return. Everyone wants petrified hamsters, then they're never happy with them.
GILES: Are you all right?
WILLOW: Yeah.
GILES: Ah yes. Your good mood is both obvious and contagious.
WILLOW: I had a fight with Tara. It was awful.
GILES: I'm sorry.
WILLOW: Me too.
GILES: You two don't quarrel much, do you?
WILLOW: Never. 'Til today.
GILES: Well, it's over now.
WILLOW: (panicked) Over? How can it be over? I just found her!
GILES: The quarrel is over.
WILLOW: Oh. Yeah.
GILES: And you'll feel better when you make your apologies. Then you'll know you can fight without the world ending.
GILES: I know it must seem bleak now, but as they say, "This too...
GILES: ...shall pass."
ANYA: Wow!
GILES: Now, what do we have here?
ANYA: He's one of those things that work for Glory.
GILES: Yes. How helpful.
SLOOK: I do indeed work for the God. Let me go if you do not wish to incur her anger.
GILES: But she's not here. What a marvelous opportunity for you and me to talk.
SLOOK: I will never betray Glorificus. I will never talk, no matter what heinous torture--
GILES: Actually, you're talking quite a lot. But not about the right things. Tell us why you were here.
SLOOK: No words shall pass my lips that would bring peril to Glorificus.
GILES: Quickly you two, on the counter... get the twine. Let's tie him up.
ANYA: What happened?
GILES: (casual, almost sheepish) He changed his mind.
SLOOK: I'm... I'm supposed to watch. We're watching the Slayer's people. (beat) While Glory fetches the Key.
WILLOW: Glory knows who the Key is?
GILES: Oh God.
ANYA: We've got to call Buffy.
SLOOK: Too late. Too late. Glorificus will find the witch and there's nothing you can do to stop her.
ANYA: Witch. What do you mean--
WILLOW: (as it hits) Tara.
SLOOK: She is the new one among you. It wasn't hard to figure out. The Glorious One will have found her by now. She will have her Key.
GILES: Willow, wait. I'll go with--
WILLOW: No. Call Buffy. Go look in Tara's room. I'm going to check the Fair.
GLORY: This is nice. Just hanging out. Just us girls.
GLORY: (re: handholding) You like this sort of thing, don't you?
GLORY: (soft and horrible) Don't make a sound.
GLORY: Nuh-uh. They won't help you.
GLORY: I'd kill them. You know that. There's no one here that can stop me.
GLORY: I'll kill her. And them. And I'll kill him. And him. And her. And it'll be all your fault.
GLORY: It's kind of funny, isn't it? All these people here and nobody who can do a thing. Not a person who can help you. That's people for you; pretty worthless.
GLORY: But Keys on the other hand... Keys are worth a very lot.
GLORY: You lying little tramp. You're not the Key. You're nothing. Just another worthless human being.
TARA: I didn't--
GLORY: I <u>hate</u> being lied to. It makes me feel so betrayed!
GLORY: Hey! Do you want to make it all better? If you tell me who the KEY really is I'll let you go. Think about it. You think your hand hurts? Imagine what you'll feel with my fingers wiggling in your brain.
GLORY: It doesn't kill you. What it does is make you feel like you're in a noisy little dark room. Naked, and ashamed. And there are things in the dark that need to hurt you 'cause you're bad. Little pinching things that go in your ears and crawl on the inside of your skull. And you know that if the noise and the crawling would stop, you could remember how to get out. But you never ever will.
GLORY: Who is the Key?
GLORY: Fine.
WILLOW: TARA!!!
WILLOW: By force of heart, and mindful power, By waning time and waxing hour...
WILLOW: I echo Diana, um, when I decree... what is it... what is it...
WILLOW: No...NOO! That she I love must now be...
WILLOW: Free. TARA!! NOOOOO!
WILLOW: Tara! Are you okay?
TARA: It's dirty. It's all dirty. And all over me. Dirty, dirty, bad. Bad!
WILLOW: Tara, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
TARA: It's under my skin. Dirt, dirt, dirt...
WILLOW: Can't she go home now?
MCCARTHY: Unfortunately, no. Hospital policy dictates we keep her for the night.
WILLOW: Does she have to? I can take care of her at home.
TARA: It's poisoned. Why don't I tell you that? It's got to be checked though.
MCCARTHY: (kind) Is she your sister?
TARA: It has to be verified of course. Anyone could tell you that. Of course. Of course.
WILLOW: (quietly) She's my everything.
MCCARTHY: Well, you can get her released first thing in the morning. But she's got to spend one night in the psych ward, just for observation. We'll keep an eye on her, do a couple basic tests and then you take her home. Does that sound fair?
MCCARTHY: Well, you hold tight then, and I'll send a nurse by in a few minutes to pick up Tara.
XANDER: Words cannot express how much I hate this place.
XANDER: And yet the same words I say when I hit my thumb with a hammer keep coming to mind.
GILES: It's dreadful.
ANYA: (darkly) It's like Communism.
BUFFY: Will. I'm so sorry.
TARA: They kill mice.
BUFFY: Tara.
BUFFY: (to Willow) I'm sorry it took me so long. But I'm here now and Dawn's safe with Spike so I can stay as long as you need me.
WILLOW: I'm so scared.
SPIKE: No one's gonna hurt you.
DAWN: Oh yeah, the same no one who did that to you?
SPIKE: What, these? Just a few bruises. Nothing to write home about.
SPIKE: Hey, chin up, Platelet. And don't get scared. Maybe Glory doesn't want to kill you. Maybe it's something--
DAWN: Worse?
SPIKE: (comfortingly) Hey.
DAWN: You want to know what I'm scared of, Spike?
DAWN: Me. Right now, Glory thinks Tara's the Key. But <u>I'm</u> the Key, Spike. <u>I</u> am. And anything that happens to Tara is 'cause of me.
DAWN: Your bruises, your limp... That's all me, too. I'm like a lightning rod for pain and hurt... and everyone around me suffers... and... (tearing up) And dies. I... This stupid Key must be something horrible... to cause so much... evil.
SPIKE: Rot--
DAWN: What do you know?
SPIKE: I'm a vampire. I know something about evil. You're not evil.
DAWN: Maybe, maybe not. Maybe I'm not evil but I don't think I can be good.
SPIKE: Well, I'm not good, and I'm okay.
TARA: Don't... please don't with that treachery. I told the cats. And now I beg my mother, sitting all alone.
WILLOW: 'Bye Tara. I'll see you tomorrow. I love you.
XANDER: Will, no. It's just for one night.
WILLOW: Yeah, I know. But it's a whole night and I don't think I can sleep without her.
ANYA: You can sleep with me. (realizing) You know, that came out a lot more lesbian than it sounded in my head.
BUFFY: Will, you just have to rest. Right now there's nothing you can do.
WILLOW: Yes, there is.
BUFFY: No. No way...
BUFFY: You can't even think about taking on Glory.
WILLOW: You saw what she did to Tara. I can't let her get away with it.
BUFFY: No, you <u>have to</u> let her get away with it. Even I'm no match for her, you know that.
WILLOW: But maybe I am.
BUFFY: You're not. And I won't let you go.
WILLOW: It's not your choice, Buffy; it's mine.
BUFFY: This is not the time.
WILLOW: (hot) When, Buffy? When is? When <u>you</u> feel like it? When it's someone <u>you</u> love like I love Tara? When it's Dawn, is that it Buffy?
BUFFY: No. When we have a chance. We'll fight her when we have a chance.
BUFFY: You wouldn't last five minutes Willow. She's a god.
WILLOW: Fine. I'll wait.
BUFFY: It's the only choice.
WILLOW: Yeah.
BUFFY: Can I do anything--
WILLOW: Just let me be alone.
GLORY: Too summery, too power-suit, eugh, way too nineties, and... oh.
GLORY: What do you think? (beat) For just a basic show up and slaughter your enemies thing.
JINX: The garments themselves merely serve to heighten your magnificence, oh holiest one.
GLORY: Good point.
GLORY: You know, I think I'm a little buzzed from eating that witch. What a mind she had. Nummy treat.
MURK: ...Is your grace not the slightest bit... concerned about...
GLORY: What, about the Slayer? Don't be stupid. I know I'm closing in. The Key's as good as mine. Girl like Buffy's got just so many friends. All I gotta do is rip through 'em, one by one, until I finally...
GLORY: Did anybody order an apocalypse?
WILLOW: Kali, Hera, Kronos, Tonic...
WILLOW: Air like nectar thick as Onyx... Cassiel by your second star...
GLORY: (realizing) It's the lover. (then) That's so cute.
WILLOW: Hold mine victim, as in tar!
WILLOW: I. Owe. You. Pain.
DAWN: So, what'd the doctors say? Is Tara... like those guys in the mental ward, or, is it different somehow?
BUFFY: They said there's no way of knowing right now.
DAWN: 'Cause... none of those guys got better. I mean, none of them.
BUFFY: (softly) Dawn honey... Tara might not either.
DAWN: It's all my fault.
BUFFY: It's <u>not</u> your fault.
DAWN: How's Willow?
BUFFY: She was looking to go all paybacky on Glory for a minute there, but I cooled her down a little. (shrugs) Actually, a lot.
SPIKE: She's not gonna do anything rash, then.
BUFFY: I explained, you know, there was no point.
SPIKE: Uh huh.
BUFFY: What?
SPIKE: So, you're saying a powerful and mightily pissed-off witch was planning to go out and spill herself a few pints of God blood until you... (skeptical) ...explained?
BUFFY: (realizing) You think she'd...? No. I told Willow, fighting Glory'd be suicide...
SPIKE: I'd do it.
SPIKE: Right person. Person I loved.
SPIKE: I'd do it.
DAWN: Think, Buffy. If Glory'd done that to me...
WILLOW: Shatter!
GLORY: (laughing) Is that it? Is that the best you can do?
GLORY: You think I care about all this? The apartment, the clothes...
GLORY: I don't give a rat's ass when it comes right down to it.
GLORY: Sucking on your girlfriend's mind, now that was something to treasure.
GLORY: What's this? Bag of tricks?
WILLOW: (grim) Bag of knives.
WILLOW: (weak) Spirit of serpents now appear. Hissing, writhing, striking near.
GLORY: Now this is getting weak...
GLORY: And so are you, honey.
GLORY: Aren't you?
GLORY: You're going to regret that.
WILLOW: (weak) No...
GLORY: You know what they used to do to witches, Lover?
GLORY: Crucify 'em.
BUFFY: They used to bow down to gods.
BUFFY: Things change.
WILLOW: (weakly) Thicken.
GLORY: This isn't over.
BUFFY: Chicken salad?
WILLOW: Right here.
BUFFY: Eggplant, that's me. And, what is this, peanut butter and... ew, <u>salami</u>, Dawn?
DAWN: Yeah, like eggplant is normal. It's what - half-egg, half-plant? 'Cause that's just unnatural.
WILLOW: What's Tara got?
DAWN: I got her tuna. Does she like... Tara, you like Tuna?
TARA: Plastic and their six sisters. Six sick sisters. Willow?
WILLOW: We'll just start a little slow today, okay? Buffy, can I have that?
WILLOW: Okay, Darling...
WILLOW: There we go. Yeah, that's my girl. It's okay. I'm right here.
DAWN: Can I help?
BUFFY: What are you gonna need?
WILLOW: I don't know... They gave me a lot of stuff to keep her calm. They said I might need to restrain her at night, but... Sometimes she's fine, she looks at me and she's fine.
BUFFY: I'm sorry I couldn't have...
WILLOW: It's okay. I can do this. I'm gonna take care of her. Even if she never... She's my girl.
BUFFY: I understand.
WILLOW: I know you do.
WILLOW: Hear that, baby? You're my always.
GLORY: I told you this wasn't over.
TARA: No! The place is cracking, cracking. No, no, no...
DAWN: Tara, it's okay. It's okay.
TARA: Look at that... the light,  it's so pure... (pointing at Dawn) Such a pure green energy. It's so beautiful.
