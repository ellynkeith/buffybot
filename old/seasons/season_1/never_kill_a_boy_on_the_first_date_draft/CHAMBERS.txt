Sorry.
(to Buffy) You okay?
(helping her up) At least now you don't have to eat the creamed corn. (then) I'm Chambers.
Buffy. We're in algebra together.
The one and lonely.
I try not to think about that.
Sounds hopeful. Who all's going?
Oh. Who else?
Buffy, what about you?
(to Buffy) How about we meet there at eight?
(getting up) I'll go with you. Cordelia, save our seats?
Hey, Buffy.
Where were you last night?
How about we try again for tonight?  I'll even lend you my watch.
We could invite the chess club, but you know, they drink a lot.
I just danced with her a couple of times. She was there all alone. I felt sorry for her.
I'll pick you up at seven.
(handing Buffy his watch; pointing) That's when the little hand's here.
See you then.
Hey, guys. (re: Giles) What's Dewey Decimal doing here?
What are your thoughts on bowling.
What is it? She's not into bowling?
You know what? I'll just kind of let Buffy lead.
What was all that stuff he was saying about being ‘chosen' and having a ‘destiny'?
Yes!
Picked up the spare.
Buffy?
Are you okay?
I guess the thing you've got to ask yourself is, is that what you really want to be?
A librarian?
Well, there you go.
Like this. And if it goes in the gutter, don't worry. It takes a long time to get good at this.
Keep at it. It'll come to you.
Did you want to go somewhere else?
Well, look at this. You guys are just showing up everywhere.
Actually, Buffy and I were just about to leave.
Cool. Party.
What do you mean?
You don't want me to go?
That's okay. I'm always up for meeting new people.
Must be a wild party.
Where's the party?
These are your friends?
Why do they look so weird?
Buffy's all alone out there.  What are we doing just sitting here?
We've got to help her!
I'll bet he's sorry he messed with me.
Does anybody have an aspirin? Or sixty?
Do I have another head back there?
(still groggy) What happened to all those guys?
Good, because, you know, I would have...
Yeah, I thought maybe we'd finish up at Ben &amp; Jerry's--
No, I think I'll just walk home.
Um, which way is home?
Uh, no. I'll go it alone.
Hey, Buffy.
Hi.
I'm sorry. I don't know how to say this, but, about last night--
Totally.
And I was kind of hoping I could see you again.
You are the most amazing girl I've ever met. You're so sweet, but there's something... dangerous about you.
Last night was incredible. When can we do it again?
How about tonight?
Tomorrow, then? Or some other time?  I quit the debate team, so I am free any night this week.
Oh. Timing.
(nodding) Right. It's you.
I get it. You just want to be friends.
(backing away) Yeah. Great. Friends.
