BUFFY: I don't think we've been properly introduced.  I'm Buffy, and you are --
BUFFY: --history.
GILES: Execution was adequate, but a bit too bloody for my taste.
BUFFY: Oh, Giles, don't mention it. It was my pleasure to make  the world safe for humanity again.
GILES: I'm not saying your methods are without merit,  but you're expending far too much time and energy. (demonstrating) It should simply be ‘plunge' and move on; ‘plunge' and move on.
BUFFY: If it's that easy, why weren't you doing it. Oh, that's right.  You were busy cowering behind a tombstone.
GILES: This isn't about me, it's about you.  It is about how there are traditions that a slayer needs to follow.
BUFFY: Tradition is yesterday's news. I'm an improv gal.  How about when I offed the first couple of V's with a single stake?  It was, ‘Slay one, kill one free.'
GILES: Ah, yes. Showing off. Yet another example of  how you're not going by the book.
BUFFY: The book. You mean that old dusty thing that's  been out of print for two thousand years?
GILES: The old ways have much to teach us.  If you insist on ignoring the fundamentals handed down  through history, you could find yourself in serious danger.
BUFFY: Gee, perhaps we should review what happened here.  Let's start with ‘I killed them all.'
BUFFY: Any questions?
MASTER: Soon it will be upon us, a day which has been spoken of for thousands of years.
MASTER: I bestow each of you with a noble distinction, for you will take part in this wonderful victory.
MASTER: Amongst the living, there will shortly be arriving a significant assemblage of souls.
MASTER: One of these will have a greater impact on our purpose than any who have come before. You must make him one of us tonight so that tomorrow he can descend and fulfill his destiny.
MASTER: For it is written, ‘Seven will rise and one will live... to free the Master.'
BUFFY: This is spooky.
BUFFY: Is the green stuff fruit, or vegetable?
WORKER: Yes.
BUFFY: I'll take it.
XANDER: (examining food) I was guessing string cheese.
CHAMBERS: Sorry.
BUFFY: No damage.
WILLOW: You luck.
BUFFY: What?
WILLOW: He was all over you.
BUFFY: Chambers? He just bumped into me.
WILLOW: Please. There was definite hip-to-hip contact.
XANDER: I hope you used protection.
BUFFY: Aw, look at him.
WILLOW: He's all alone.
XANDER: Gee, wonder why? Could it be the ‘I was a teenage mannequin' look?
BUFFY: Okay, so as a type, he's not exactly my proto. I just think maybe someone should sit by him.
WILLOW: But who?
BUFFY: Might have to be us.
WILLOW: Looks like it.
BUFFY: You know, just to be friendly.
XANDER: Boy, are you two being taken on a tour. Am I the only one who can see through his good looks and the pleasant demeanor to behold the sick, perverted deviant within?
XANDER: You don't have to answer right away.
BUFFY: (over-doing it) Willow, wherever will we sit? (then, noticing) Oh, I guess this will have to do.
CORDELIA: Hey, look. An empty seat.
CHAMBERS: (to Buffy) You okay?
BUFFY: Yeah. Boy, her hips are wider than I thought.
CHAMBERS: (helping her up) At least now you don't have to eat the creamed corn. (then) I'm Chambers.
BUFFY: (feigning ignorance) Oh, it's so nice to finally learn your name. I'm--
CHAMBERS: Buffy. We're in algebra together.
BUFFY: With Mr. McKamy.
CHAMBERS: The one and lonely.
BUFFY: Tell me, how does he manage to get chalk dust all over his--
CHAMBERS: I try not to think about that.
BUFFY: (gesturing) This is my friend, Willow.
WILLOW: (babbling) I took algebra last year because I'm a year ahead, so now I'm taking pre-calculus which is really hard, but I'm in the gifted class, well, my parents signed me up for it, how embarrassing is that, and maybe I should get a janitor to take care of this mess. (as she goes off) Clean up on aisle seven!
CORDELIA: Poor girl always forgets to take her medication. (then) Hey, Chambers, a bunch of us are loitering at the Bronze tonight. You there?
CHAMBERS: Sounds hopeful. Who all's going?
CORDELIA: Well, there's me.
CHAMBERS: Oh. Who else?
CORDELIA: You mean besides me?
CHAMBERS: Buffy, what about you?
BUFFY: (caught off-guard) What?
CORDELIA: No, she doesn't--
CHAMBERS: (to Buffy) How about we meet there at eight?
BUFFY: Yeah. Eight. There. (then) I should probably get another lunch that isn't so... on the floor.
CHAMBERS: (getting up) I'll go with you. Cordelia, save our seats?
BUFFY: Willow, it's not that big a deal. It's just a bunch of people getting together. I mean, sure, Chambers asked me specifically right in front of Cordelia. And, yeah, he gave me the marshmallows from his Jell-o during l unch. And then he walked me to History class and said ‘I can't wait to see you tonight.'
WILLOW: I guess I blew it way out of proportion.
BUFFY: All right, it's a big deal. Did you notice how the corners of his mouth curled up when he chewed?
WILLOW: I missed that. I was too busy looking down and to the left of his 501 label.
BUFFY: I'd like to see an IMAX of that. (stops herself) Wait a minute. 
WILLOW: What's wrong?
BUFFY: If you listen real close, I'm starting to sound like a regular teenager. I've got friends. I've got a date. All I need now are zits and an eating disorder.
GILES: Good afternoon, ladies.
BUFFY: Although I should probably do something about that supernatural ability to destroy the undead.
GILES: I'm under the impression there's some sort of ironic tone in that statement, but as an Englishman I'm incapable of discerning it.
BUFFY: Yeah? Well, that makes us even, because I don't get Benny Hill.
GILES: In any case, that supernatural ability, which you should cherish and treasure, if I might add--
BUFFY: You always do.
GILES: --is needed tonight.
BUFFY: Close the beach on that idea. I've got a very big meeting tonight with -- okay, let's just call him what he is -- a god.
GILES: Oh, no. You have much more urgent business to attend to.
BUFFY: More urgent than me moving past ‘Buffy, The Celibate Years'? I don't think so.
GILES: My books tell of a major event occurring on the evening of the 1,000th day after the Septugian Sunset. That's tonight.
WILLOW: Already? Seems like just last week was the 1,000th day after the last Septugian Sunset. Where does the time go?
GILES: According to my calculations, we are due for a fresh rising of vampires. It is prophesied: (reading from his notebook) ‘On that day, seven souls will be captures into the darkness. And the Master will look upon one of them and be pleased.'
BUFFY: Too bad, because I looked upon Chambers and was very pleased.
GILES: The slayer must be present tonight. Your responsibilities to the world are paramount.
BUFFY: (pleading) But... cute guy. Teenager. Post-pubescent fantasies.
GILES: You'll have to put those on hold. For tonight, we do battle!
GILES: Perhaps I miscalculated.
BUFFY: I'm thinking yes.
GILES: I was so sure. (then) Well, you know what they say.
BUFFY: Not really.
GILES: Ninety percent of the vampire slaying game is waiting.
BUFFY: You couldn't have told me that ninety percent ago?
GILES: Oh, well. At least we were here at the ready, so it wasn't a completely wasted evening.
BUFFY: Yes, Giles, it was. But that's okay. I'm sure I'll have another shot at teenage happiness someday. Like when I'm thirty.
GILES: Come now. What you consider a curse, others would call a gift. Be thankful you're not burdened with trivial matters like what to wear to next month's hay dance.
BUFFY: I wish I could worry about trivial things. And not that you'd care, but I'm thinking gingham. (gathering her things) Now, if you'll excuse me, I might still have a chance to salvage the remains of my dating career.
GILES: I needn't warn you about the dangers of becoming personally involved with someone who is unaware of your unique condition.
BUFFY: Yeah, yeah. I've read the back of the box.
GILES: If your identity as the slayer is revealed, it could put you and those around you in grave danger.
BUFFY: Oh, then in that case I won't wear my button that says ‘I'm a Slayer - Ask Me How!'
BOY: When are we going to get on the airplane?
MOTHER: We'll be there in just a few minutes.
BOY: (excitedly) We're going to Tacoma!
MOTHER: (sitting her son back down) Leave the man alone, honey.
DRIVER: Oh, boy, you're beautiful!
DRIVER: I don't believe it. I don't believe it!
DRIVER: I'm in no mood to play games. Let's go!
DRIVER: Well, it's about time, Charlie.
DRIVER: Is everyone okay?
MOTHER: The door's stuck.
GUY: (exploding) Shut up!
GUY: I think someone's coming.
DRIVER: We're going to be okay.
XANDER: So you just went home?
BUFFY: What was I supposed to do? Say to Chambers, ‘Sorry I'm late. I was sitting in a cemetery with the librarian waiting for some vampires to rise so that I could slam a few stakes into their hearts but it was a false alarm so now, hey, let's dance'?
XANDER: (weighing this with his hands) Or... flat tire.
BUFFY: Giles should come with a Surgeon General's warning: may be hazardous to Buffy's social life. He's completely not cognizant. It's as if he's never even been on a date.
XANDER: Distinct possibility.
BUFFY: I can't take this anymore. I feel like everyone's staring at me, the hideous dateless monster.
BUFFY: That's right, I have no life. Move along, pal. Nothing to see here.
XANDER: You're reacting a little overly, aren't you? Everyone likes you. I bet you could have any guy in the school.
BUFFY: That's a nice thing to say. You're a good friend.
CHAMBERS: Hey, Buffy.
BUFFY: (brightening) Chambers.
XANDER: Oh, look, it's Chambers. Buffy and Chambers. And Xander. That'd be me.
CHAMBERS: Where were you last night?
BUFFY: (rambling) Oh, I, uh... broke my watch, and we don't have any clocks in our house, so I didn't know what time it was, actually, I didn't even know what day it was. Was that last night? I'm sorry.
CHAMBERS: How about we try again for tonight?  I'll even lend you my watch.
BUFFY: Tonight? You and me?
CHAMBERS: We could invite the chess club, but you know, they drink a lot.
BUFFY: Well, no, it's just I kind of heard that you and Cordelia were somewhat... all over each other. A little.
CHAMBERS: I just danced with her a couple of times. She was there all alone. I felt sorry for her.
XANDER: Yay! I've been looking for this pen cap for weeks.
BUFFY: Tonight. (calculating in her head) Let's see, if I rearrange, and move that to next week, and then shift that to -- sure. Tonight'll work.
CHAMBERS: I'll pick you up at seven.
BUFFY: Seven.
CHAMBERS: (handing Buffy his watch; pointing) That's when the little hand's here.
BUFFY: (playing along) Ah, right between the six and the eight.
CHAMBERS: See you then.
BUFFY: (to Xander) Tonight! Isn't that so?
XANDER: (fake chipper) Oh, yeah. I'm sure you and Gaggy Von Gaggenheimer will have a great time.
BUFFY: Come on, be happy for me.
XANDER: This is me being happy. You should see me Christmas morning. I barely even crack a smile. But I'm all sugar plums dancing on the inside.
MASTER: You have done excellent work.
MASTER: Everything is happening as was foretold. But there is one final task you must perform.
MASTER: It has been presaged that the special one will bring with him strengths and powers drawn from the deepest darkness. Deliver him to me as soon as he has risen.
WILLOW: Pick.
BUFFY: Let's see. Do I want to appear shy, coy and naïve, or do I go unrestrained, insatiable and aggressive.
XANDER: You know, Chambers is a little homespun. He probably doesn't like that overly-assertive look. (looking in her closet) Hey, here's something. A nice, comfy overcoat.
XANDER: And this ski cap. The earflaps will bring out your eyes.
BUFFY: (to Willow) I think I'll mix-n-match. (then) Xander, guy's opinion. (she uncaps two lipsticks) Which one do you think Chambers will like better?
XANDER: Oh, you mean for kissing you and then telling all his friends how easy you are so that the whole school loses respect for you and talks behind your back? The red's good.
BUFFY: Thanks. I'll go with the peach.
WILLOW: (handing Buffy some clothes) Put this on.
XANDER: You're not bothering me.
WILLOW: So, where's the taking you?
BUFFY: I don't know. Where do you suppose the young kids are going on dates these days?
WILLOW: Well, I read somewhere that sometimes they go to movies.
BUFFY: Movies. Interesting.
XANDER: And once on TV I saw a bunch of people our age at a party.
BUFFY: Wow. I never knew being a teenager was so full of possibilities.
BUFFY: That's Chambers!
BUFFY: That's Giles.
GILES: Tonight is absolutely the night.
BUFFY: I'm not home.
GILES: The prophecy is happening. Look.
GILES: My theory was correct. Seven people were killed last night.
BUFFY: (as if to a child) Yeah. In a car crash.
GILES: Those deaths were forecast more than three thousand years ago. And listen to this. (reading newspaper) ‘Also among the dead was Andrew Borba, whom police had been pursuing for months in connection with a series of brutal assaults.' (then) That's the one the Master is waiting for. He is set to rise with the others tonight. My calculations make me sure of it.
BUFFY: You were sure of it last night. You showed me charts and drafts and calendars.
GILES: (hangs his head) I forgot about leap year.
XANDER: Of all the luck. A vampire uprising on the night of your big date. Isn't that always the way?
BUFFY: Not tonight it ain't.
GILES: Buffy, you have to believe me--
BUFFY: You expect me to buy into your open-to-interpretation interpretation when you can't even remember to carry the four?
GILES: You must answer your calling.
BUFFY: Last night I answered it and they put me on hold.
CHAMBERS: Hey, guys. (re: Giles) What's Dewey Decimal doing here?
BUFFY: Oh. He's, uh, out promoting Bookmobile awareness. We call him gruff but lovable Giles. But enough about him. What's the plan?
CHAMBERS: What are your thoughts on bowling.
BUFFY: If it gets me off this doorstep, I'm for it.
GILES: So you're just going to go.
BUFFY: If you say so.
GILES: You're just going to ignore the fact that you've been chosen and have a destiny to fulfill.
WILLOW: Uh, Chambers--
XANDER: Yeah. A couple of things about tonight.
CHAMBERS: What is it? She's not into bowling?
XANDER: Well, it's too late to do anything about that. But you should probably know Buffy doesn't like to be kissed. Actually, she doesn't even like to be touched.
WILLOW: Xander...
XANDER: As a matter of fact, don't even look at her. She really hates that.
CHAMBERS: You know what? I'll just kind of let Buffy lead.
XANDER: Oh, she can't stand that most of all.
GILES: All right, then. I don't need you. This is a subject on which I am well versed. I've spent night after night in that library reading book after book after book--
BUFFY: On the plus side, you've missed the career of Sheryl Crow.
GILES: One of us has to take your obligation seriously, and if it's not going to be you, then I'll go do it alone.
BUFFY: Fine. It should be very exciting for you doing absolutely nothing all by yourself.
GILES: Ha! What you fail to realize is that that's what I do best!
BUFFY: (sweetly) Okay, all set! (to Xander and Willow) Don't wait up.
CHAMBERS: What was all that stuff he was saying about being ‘chosen' and having a ‘destiny'?
BUFFY: He's grooming me to be the next librarian.
WILLOW: This is bad.
XANDER: I wish it was just bad.
WILLOW: We're going to have to take steps.
XANDER: Yep. We've got to follow Buffy and Chambers. I do not trust that guy.
WILLOW: Xander, we have to go with Giles. He could get into trouble.
XANDER: Oh, he'll be fine. He's like SuperLibrarian. Everyone forgets, Willow, that knowledge is the ultimate weapon.
XANDER: All right, all right. But if Buffy shows up at school tomorrow married with three children, you're going to look pretty stupid.
CHAMBERS: Yes!
CHAMBERS: Picked up the spare.
CHAMBERS: Buffy?
BUFFY: (startled) What? Oh, sorry.
CHAMBERS: Are you okay?
BUFFY: I'm just... thinking about what Giles said.
CHAMBERS: I guess the thing you've got to ask yourself is, is that what you really want to be?
BUFFY: (taken aback) What?
CHAMBERS: A librarian?
BUFFY: Oh. Not even.
CHAMBERS: Well, there you go.
BUFFY: (brightening somewhat) You know, you're right. I do go there. Thanks.
BUFFY: Now how do you do this again?
CHAMBERS: Like this. And if it goes in the gutter, don't worry. It takes a long time to get good at this.
CHAMBERS: Keep at it. It'll come to you.
BUFFY: Hey!
BUFFY: Oh. I'm sorry. I couldn't help but notice your... shoes. They're just like mine. Okay. That's all.
BUFFY: Look out!
GUY: (frightened) Go ahead! You can use it first!
BUFFY: I am so begging your forgiveness. It's just that with your hair and your clothes and... you're so pale.
GUY: I know. People always mistake me for Butch Patrick.
CHAMBERS: Did you want to go somewhere else?
BUFFY: No, are you kidding? I am loving the bowling thing! You got your ball, you got your pins. No wonder it's America's second favorite indoor activity. You're up.
BUFFY: (to herself) Okay, Buff, say hi to reality. Absolutely nothing is going to happen tonight.
GILES: (confidently) You don't frighten me.
GILES: I've studied your kind for years. I'll just go by the book.
GILES: We're gonna need a bigger book.
GILES: I didn't want to have to do this,  but I'm afraid you gentlemen leave me with no alternative.
GILES: (clutching his bag, calling out) I've got another clove and I'm not afraid to use it!
GILES: Thank heavens you're here.
GILES: I'm being hunted down by a team of vampires.
GILES: That would be good.
GUY: Sure, I worked with Fred Gwynne for years.  Come back to my place and I'll tell you about  the time me and Al Lewis filled his boots with rice pudding.
WILLOW: Buffy, I'm glad we caught you.
CHAMBERS: Well, look at this. You guys are just showing up everywhere.
BUFFY: What are you doing here?
XANDER: Quick, we've got to get to--
XANDER: Uh, we thought it'd be fun to make this a double date.
BUFFY: (suspicious) With you? I didn't know you two were seeing each other?
WILLOW: Oh, yeah. Going on nine days now.  We knew it would happen eventually and figured, hey, why fight it?
XANDER: (trying to be sincere) Yeah. Sometimes love just blossoms.
BUFFY: You've hidden it so well.
XANDER: (whispering to Willow) I don't think she's buying it.
WILLOW: (whispering to Xander) Yeah. We'd better make out.
CHAMBERS: Actually, Buffy and I were just about to leave.
XANDER: Hey, if you guys are exiting,  maybe we should all go somewhere together.
BUFFY: Gee, that is so nice of you to ask.  But Chambers and I were kind of, well, Chambers and I.
WILLOW: Come on. We can go... some place.  We can do... some things. It'll be a blast!
BUFFY: Where were you guys thinking?
XANDER: Oh, there are so many options.
XANDER: You know what would be fun?  I hear there's kind of like a party going on. (deliberately) At the cemetery.
WILLOW: (deliberately) Giles is there.
BUFFY: (mocking their tone) Thank you, I know.
XANDER: With some friends.
BUFFY: Oh, no. Giles. (then) We've got to get over there.
CHAMBERS: Cool. Party.
BUFFY: Oh. Chambers. Maybe we should  do the goodbye thing here.
CHAMBERS: What do you mean?
BUFFY: Well, this party... After bowling,  it'll probably be anti-climactic.
CHAMBERS: You don't want me to go?
BUFFY: No, it's just, well, you wouldn't really  know anyone. They don't go to our school.
CHAMBERS: That's okay. I'm always up for meeting new people.
WILLOW: Buffy, we really need to get there.
BUFFY: I know, I know. But... (looks up at Chambers; then gives up) Okay, let's make it a foursome.
WILLOW: (to Xander) I'm still thinking it would help if we make out.
CHAMBERS: Must be a wild party.
BUFFY: You guys stay here. Let me check it out.
WILLOW: (to Chambers; covering) She likes to make an entrance.
BUFFY: Viewing hours are over.
BUFFY: Funeral services will be held--
BUFFY: --now.
BUFFY: (re: stake) Where do you want it?
BUFFY: I guess that answers that.
BUFFY: That's the last time I spend two hours on my hair.
BUFFY: Giles?
BUFFY: Where?
BUFFY: That's not Giles.
BUFFY: I'm trying, I'm trying.
BUFFY: Ew, that had to hurt.
BUFFY: That's... well, that's just wrong.
GILES: How was your date?
BUFFY: Apparently, better than yours.
GILES: Well, I suppose I don't have to say  that I was correct in my prediction.
BUFFY: Something tells me you will anyway.
GILES: No, no. I won't bask in the glory and rub your nose  in the fact that old Giles was right and that young,  inexperienced Buffy was one-hundred percent wrong.
BUFFY: Thank you.
GILES: It would only further heighten the  current embarrassment you must be--
BUFFY: Annoyance factor dangerously high.
GILES: I'm done.
BUFFY: What were you thinking taking on vampires  by yourself? You're a watcher, not a slayer.
GILES: What else could I do? You were off acting  like an irresponsible teenager.
BUFFY: I am an irresponsible teenager.
GILES: How long are you going to fall back on that  hollow justification for your juvenile activities.
BUFFY: I'm thinking it should do me until I'm about twenty.
CHAMBERS: Where's the party?
BUFFY: It's pretty much over.
GILES: On the contrary, it's just about to begin.
BUFFY: Meaning exactly-- huh?
GILES: Our previous two ‘guests' were, as you noticed,  only two. If you'll recall, the announcement about  tonight's event specifically stated there would be  seven in the attendance. Too, the invited ones will  be dressed in, shall we say, their ‘funeral best.'
BUFFY: (realizing) Because this is their first night.
GILES: Exactly. And we mustn't forget about  the ‘guest of honor' who will be rising-- (off Chambers) --coming to the party with evening.
BUFFY: So when do these guests arrive?
GILES: I have no idea. They were scheduled to be here by now.
BUFFY: (impatiently) Maybe this time you forgot to account for Daylight Savings.
VAMPIRE: Sorry, we're late.
CHAMBERS: These are your friends?
BUFFY: No. They're crashers.
CHAMBERS: Why do they look so weird?
XANDER: They're, uh, on something.
WILLOW: Probably PCP.
BUFFY: Just say no.
GILES: Here. Hold this garlic.
WILLOW: These are shallots.
GILES: Drat. I always get those confused.
XANDER: I think this is a cross.
GILES: That should work.
CHAMBERS: Buffy's all alone out there.  What are we doing just sitting here?
GILES: She knows what she's doing.
CHAMBERS: We've got to help her!
BUFFY: Chambers, no--!
CHAMBERS: I'll bet he's sorry he messed with me.
VAMPIRE: Now see what you did?  You went and got your friend killed.
BUFFY: You've made me very angry.
VAMPIRE: This old guy's still got some life in him.
BUFFY: Famous last words.
VAMPIRE: Honey, I have a gift for you.
VAMPIRE: I got her!
BUFFY: And you two made such a cute couple.
BUFFY: Why did that stupid prophecy have to come true tonight?
GILES: Evil does not like to wait.
BUFFY: It waited three thousand years. It couldn't wait one more night?
GILES: Buffy, I know this may be a small consolation,  but you have done a great service to humankind.  You prevented the chosen one from freeing the Master.
BUFFY: So what? Chambers is dead. All these other  people are dead. And for what? Why does  this kind of stuff have to happen?
GILES: I gave up long ago trying to answer such questions.
BUFFY: These people didn't do anything wrong.  They were just innocent victims. They didn't ask to be turned into vampires. They didn't  know about any prophecy. I'll bet the chosen  on didn't even know he was the chosen one.
XANDER: I think he knows.
BUFFY: He's big.
GILES: You can beat him, Buffy. Just remember  your training. Don't try anything fancy.  Stick with the fundamentals.
BUFFY: Stay out of it, Giles. This is between me and him.
BUFFY: You're the reason my date got killed.
WILLOW: Buffy...
BUFFY: By the time I'm done with you,  you'll wish you were dead. Or, weren't dead. I mean--
XANDER: Buffy, Chambers is --
GILES: (to Xander) Let's give her a minute.
BUFFY: Our first date--
BUFFY: --and I get the guy killed!
BUFFY: What am I going to tell his parents?
VAMPIRE: Oops.
BUFFY: Uh, Giles? Help?
GILES: The book! It'll know what to do.
BUFFY: (to Giles; urgent) Now?
GILES: (leafing through books) Looking, looking.
BUFFY: Use the book!
GILES: I am.
BUFFY: No. Use the book!
GILES: Right!
BUFFY: Good thing you didn't bring the Cliff's Notes.
CHAMBERS: Does anybody have an aspirin? Or sixty?
BUFFY: Chambers!
BUFFY: You're okay.
CHAMBERS: Do I have another head back there?
BUFFY: I think it'll heal.
CHAMBERS: (still groggy) What happened to all those guys?
BUFFY: We scared them away.
CHAMBERS: Good, because, you know, I would have...
BUFFY: I know. (a beat) I'm sure this isn't what you expected on our first date.
CHAMBERS: Yeah, I thought maybe we'd finish up at Ben &amp; Jerry's--
BUFFY: We still could.
CHAMBERS: No, I think I'll just walk home.
CHAMBERS: Um, which way is home?
BUFFY: I'll get you there.
CHAMBERS: Uh, no. I'll go it alone.
XANDER: We'll make sure he gets there okay.
WILLOW: (to Xander) Then we should probably make out.
GILES: Well, it's a good thing I planned ahead. Otherwise,  you'd be merely the latest in a long line of slayers whose lives were cut short by carelessness and overconfidence.
BUFFY: Giles, you're gushing.
GILES: I'm sure you're aware that your over-flamboyant  moves nearly cost us our lies. Had you stuck to the fundamentals--
BUFFY: Is that all you ever think about?
GILES: Yes. That's what I'm supposed to think about.
BUFFY: Well, I think about other things. Like my life, my future,  my kitchenette at the Old Single Woman's Home.
GILES: Must you always be so dramatic?
BUFFY: I'm a high school sophomore. It comes with the package.
GILES: You have duties as a slayer--
BUFFY: Didn't you see what happened here? I really liked  Chambers, and now any chance I have with him  is ruined because of my stupid destiny.
GILES: Buffy, you can not ignore who you are.
BUFFY: Hey, I never wanted this. I like who I was before just fine.  And you know what I liked best about then? I didn't know you!
BUFFY: Did Chambers get home okay?
XANDER: Yeah.
BUFFY: Did he say anything about me?
WILLOW: You mean specifically about you?
BUFFY: Or generally, in the area, in the ballpark, any sort of implication--
XANDER: Oh, well, in that case, no.
WILLOW: But he was pretty incoherent, so maybe we missed it.
XANDER: No.
BUFFY: I knew it. I totally blew it.
CHAMBERS: Hey, Buffy.
BUFFY: Chambers...
WILLOW: (to Xander) I think this is our stop.
CHAMBERS: Hi.
BUFFY: Hi.
BUFFY: This is going well.
CHAMBERS: I'm sorry. I don't know how to say this, but, about last night--
BUFFY: You don't even have to. I'm sure you were pretty freaked out.
CHAMBERS: Totally.
BUFFY: Okay, then.
CHAMBERS: And I was kind of hoping I could see you again.
BUFFY: I'm sorry. That was my hopeful ear. (turning her head) Could you say that again?
CHAMBERS: You are the most amazing girl I've ever met. You're so sweet, but there's something... dangerous about you.
BUFFY: (smiling) Really?
CHAMBERS: Last night was incredible. When can we do it again?
BUFFY: Again.
CHAMBERS: How about tonight?
BUFFY: Tonight would be--
BUFFY: --not a workable thing.
CHAMBERS: Tomorrow, then? Or some other time?  I quit the debate team, so I am free any night this week.
BUFFY: Actually, you see, the thing is... (struggling for words) You're a really nice guy. But the timing's all off.
CHAMBERS: Oh. Timing.
BUFFY: Don't take this personally, I mean, it's not you, it's me.
CHAMBERS: (nodding) Right. It's you.
BUFFY: Believe me, it's me. I've just got to take some time  and balance out some things in my life. Because you  see, I'm... different. And I think after a while you'd  want something that's a little more, well, there.  But I'm still hoping--
CHAMBERS: I get it. You just want to be friends.
BUFFY: That'd be nice.
CHAMBERS: (backing away) Yeah. Great. Friends.
BUFFY: Yeah, it was.
GILES: He cares for you very much.
BUFFY: That's why I had to end it. Chambers was way  too into what was going on last night. If we'd kept  going out, he could have ended up getting killed. Or worse.
GILES: I'm afraid you're probably right.
BUFFY: And I thought, I'm not being fair to him.  He deserves a normal life. He shouldn't have to put up with all... (searching) this.
GILES: No one should.
BUFFY: But I'm sure there will be other gorgeous guys  who would do anything for me and are perfect  in every way. Oh, wait, no there won't. Because I'm a freak.
GILES: You know, there's no reason we absolutely  have to train tonight. According to my calculations, no uprisings are planned for at least another twenty-three days.
BUFFY: Should I ink that, or just pencil it?
GILES: Let me get back to you.
BUFFY: Oh, I meant to thank you. That book really came  in handy last night. Maybe we could check out  some of the stuff inside.
GILES: I thought you had no use for the old ways.
BUFFY: Never hurts to cover your bases.
GILES: You had them covered pretty well last night.  That over-the-shoulder stake toss was right on target.
BUFFY: On that one I got lucky. But you and the book?  That's what saved my glutes.
GILES: I beg to differ. I didn't do a thing. It was you who  kept us from becoming -- how do you kids say it -- dog meat.
BUFFY: What are you talking about? The Giles-man came prepared.  I just showed up and started swinging.
GILES: Buffy, please. You're the one who drove a stake through  the heart of that ancient prophecy. You fulfilled your  duties as a slayer to perfection. We can count this as  another defeat for the Master.
MASTER: I am very pleased. Your arrival has been eagerly  anticipated. You are gifted in way of which you are  yet unaware, and with your help I will finally be free. Welcome.
