I don't think we've been properly introduced.  I'm Buffy, and you are --
--history.
Oh, Giles, don't mention it. It was my pleasure to make  the world safe for humanity again.
If it's that easy, why weren't you doing it. Oh, that's right.  You were busy cowering behind a tombstone.
Tradition is yesterday's news. I'm an improv gal.  How about when I offed the first couple of V's with a single stake?  It was, ‘Slay one, kill one free.'
The book. You mean that old dusty thing that's  been out of print for two thousand years?
Gee, perhaps we should review what happened here.  Let's start with ‘I killed them all.'
Any questions?
This is spooky.
Is the green stuff fruit, or vegetable?
I'll take it.
No damage.
What?
Chambers? He just bumped into me.
Aw, look at him.
Okay, so as a type, he's not exactly my proto. I just think maybe someone should sit by him.
Might have to be us.
You know, just to be friendly.
(over-doing it) Willow, wherever will we sit? (then, noticing) Oh, I guess this will have to do.
Yeah. Boy, her hips are wider than I thought.
(feigning ignorance) Oh, it's so nice to finally learn your name. I'm--
With Mr. McKamy.
Tell me, how does he manage to get chalk dust all over his--
(gesturing) This is my friend, Willow.
(caught off-guard) What?
Yeah. Eight. There. (then) I should probably get another lunch that isn't so... on the floor.
Willow, it's not that big a deal. It's just a bunch of people getting together. I mean, sure, Chambers asked me specifically right in front of Cordelia. And, yeah, he gave me the marshmallows from his Jell-o during l unch. And then he walked me to History class and said ‘I can't wait to see you tonight.'
All right, it's a big deal. Did you notice how the corners of his mouth curled up when he chewed?
I'd like to see an IMAX of that. (stops herself) Wait a minute. 
If you listen real close, I'm starting to sound like a regular teenager. I've got friends. I've got a date. All I need now are zits and an eating disorder.
Although I should probably do something about that supernatural ability to destroy the undead.
Yeah? Well, that makes us even, because I don't get Benny Hill.
You always do.
Close the beach on that idea. I've got a very big meeting tonight with -- okay, let's just call him what he is -- a god.
More urgent than me moving past ‘Buffy, The Celibate Years'? I don't think so.
Too bad, because I looked upon Chambers and was very pleased.
(pleading) But... cute guy. Teenager. Post-pubescent fantasies.
I'm thinking yes.
Not really.
You couldn't have told me that ninety percent ago?
Yes, Giles, it was. But that's okay. I'm sure I'll have another shot at teenage happiness someday. Like when I'm thirty.
I wish I could worry about trivial things. And not that you'd care, but I'm thinking gingham. (gathering her things) Now, if you'll excuse me, I might still have a chance to salvage the remains of my dating career.
Yeah, yeah. I've read the back of the box.
Oh, then in that case I won't wear my button that says ‘I'm a Slayer - Ask Me How!'
What was I supposed to do? Say to Chambers, ‘Sorry I'm late. I was sitting in a cemetery with the librarian waiting for some vampires to rise so that I could slam a few stakes into their hearts but it was a false alarm so now, hey, let's dance'?
Giles should come with a Surgeon General's warning: may be hazardous to Buffy's social life. He's completely not cognizant. It's as if he's never even been on a date.
I can't take this anymore. I feel like everyone's staring at me, the hideous dateless monster.
That's right, I have no life. Move along, pal. Nothing to see here.
That's a nice thing to say. You're a good friend.
(brightening) Chambers.
(rambling) Oh, I, uh... broke my watch, and we don't have any clocks in our house, so I didn't know what time it was, actually, I didn't even know what day it was. Was that last night? I'm sorry.
Tonight? You and me?
Well, no, it's just I kind of heard that you and Cordelia were somewhat... all over each other. A little.
Tonight. (calculating in her head) Let's see, if I rearrange, and move that to next week, and then shift that to -- sure. Tonight'll work.
Seven.
(playing along) Ah, right between the six and the eight.
(to Xander) Tonight! Isn't that so?
Come on, be happy for me.
Let's see. Do I want to appear shy, coy and naïve, or do I go unrestrained, insatiable and aggressive.
(to Willow) I think I'll mix-n-match. (then) Xander, guy's opinion. (she uncaps two lipsticks) Which one do you think Chambers will like better?
Thanks. I'll go with the peach.
I don't know. Where do you suppose the young kids are going on dates these days?
Movies. Interesting.
Wow. I never knew being a teenager was so full of possibilities.
That's Chambers!
That's Giles.
I'm not home.
(as if to a child) Yeah. In a car crash.
You were sure of it last night. You showed me charts and drafts and calendars.
Not tonight it ain't.
You expect me to buy into your open-to-interpretation interpretation when you can't even remember to carry the four?
Last night I answered it and they put me on hold.
Oh. He's, uh, out promoting Bookmobile awareness. We call him gruff but lovable Giles. But enough about him. What's the plan?
If it gets me off this doorstep, I'm for it.
If you say so.
On the plus side, you've missed the career of Sheryl Crow.
Fine. It should be very exciting for you doing absolutely nothing all by yourself.
(sweetly) Okay, all set! (to Xander and Willow) Don't wait up.
He's grooming me to be the next librarian.
(startled) What? Oh, sorry.
I'm just... thinking about what Giles said.
(taken aback) What?
Oh. Not even.
(brightening somewhat) You know, you're right. I do go there. Thanks.
Now how do you do this again?
Hey!
Oh. I'm sorry. I couldn't help but notice your... shoes. They're just like mine. Okay. That's all.
Look out!
I am so begging your forgiveness. It's just that with your hair and your clothes and... you're so pale.
No, are you kidding? I am loving the bowling thing! You got your ball, you got your pins. No wonder it's America's second favorite indoor activity. You're up.
(to herself) Okay, Buff, say hi to reality. Absolutely nothing is going to happen tonight.
What are you doing here?
(suspicious) With you? I didn't know you two were seeing each other?
You've hidden it so well.
Gee, that is so nice of you to ask.  But Chambers and I were kind of, well, Chambers and I.
Where were you guys thinking?
(mocking their tone) Thank you, I know.
Oh, no. Giles. (then) We've got to get over there.
Oh. Chambers. Maybe we should  do the goodbye thing here.
Well, this party... After bowling,  it'll probably be anti-climactic.
No, it's just, well, you wouldn't really  know anyone. They don't go to our school.
I know, I know. But... (looks up at Chambers; then gives up) Okay, let's make it a foursome.
You guys stay here. Let me check it out.
Viewing hours are over.
Funeral services will be held--
--now.
(re: stake) Where do you want it?
I guess that answers that.
That's the last time I spend two hours on my hair.
Giles?
Where?
That's not Giles.
I'm trying, I'm trying.
Ew, that had to hurt.
That's... well, that's just wrong.
Apparently, better than yours.
Something tells me you will anyway.
Thank you.
Annoyance factor dangerously high.
What were you thinking taking on vampires  by yourself? You're a watcher, not a slayer.
I am an irresponsible teenager.
I'm thinking it should do me until I'm about twenty.
It's pretty much over.
Meaning exactly-- huh?
(realizing) Because this is their first night.
So when do these guests arrive?
(impatiently) Maybe this time you forgot to account for Daylight Savings.
No. They're crashers.
Just say no.
Chambers, no--!
You've made me very angry.
Famous last words.
And you two made such a cute couple.
Why did that stupid prophecy have to come true tonight?
It waited three thousand years. It couldn't wait one more night?
So what? Chambers is dead. All these other  people are dead. And for what? Why does  this kind of stuff have to happen?
These people didn't do anything wrong.  They were just innocent victims. They didn't ask to be turned into vampires. They didn't  know about any prophecy. I'll bet the chosen  on didn't even know he was the chosen one.
He's big.
Stay out of it, Giles. This is between me and him.
You're the reason my date got killed.
By the time I'm done with you,  you'll wish you were dead. Or, weren't dead. I mean--
Our first date--
--and I get the guy killed!
What am I going to tell his parents?
Uh, Giles? Help?
(to Giles; urgent) Now?
Use the book!
No. Use the book!
Good thing you didn't bring the Cliff's Notes.
Chambers!
You're okay.
I think it'll heal.
We scared them away.
I know. (a beat) I'm sure this isn't what you expected on our first date.
We still could.
I'll get you there.
Giles, you're gushing.
Is that all you ever think about?
Well, I think about other things. Like my life, my future,  my kitchenette at the Old Single Woman's Home.
I'm a high school sophomore. It comes with the package.
Didn't you see what happened here? I really liked  Chambers, and now any chance I have with him  is ruined because of my stupid destiny.
Hey, I never wanted this. I like who I was before just fine.  And you know what I liked best about then? I didn't know you!
Did Chambers get home okay?
Did he say anything about me?
Or generally, in the area, in the ballpark, any sort of implication--
I knew it. I totally blew it.
Chambers...
Hi.
This is going well.
You don't even have to. I'm sure you were pretty freaked out.
Okay, then.
I'm sorry. That was my hopeful ear. (turning her head) Could you say that again?
(smiling) Really?
Again.
Tonight would be--
--not a workable thing.
Actually, you see, the thing is... (struggling for words) You're a really nice guy. But the timing's all off.
Don't take this personally, I mean, it's not you, it's me.
Believe me, it's me. I've just got to take some time  and balance out some things in my life. Because you  see, I'm... different. And I think after a while you'd  want something that's a little more, well, there.  But I'm still hoping--
That'd be nice.
Yeah, it was.
That's why I had to end it. Chambers was way  too into what was going on last night. If we'd kept  going out, he could have ended up getting killed. Or worse.
And I thought, I'm not being fair to him.  He deserves a normal life. He shouldn't have to put up with all... (searching) this.
But I'm sure there will be other gorgeous guys  who would do anything for me and are perfect  in every way. Oh, wait, no there won't. Because I'm a freak.
Should I ink that, or just pencil it?
Oh, I meant to thank you. That book really came  in handy last night. Maybe we could check out  some of the stuff inside.
Never hurts to cover your bases.
On that one I got lucky. But you and the book?  That's what saved my glutes.
What are you talking about? The Giles-man came prepared.  I just showed up and started swinging.
