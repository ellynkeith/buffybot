Oh riiight, your skin. That must be horrible. Do you  get it on your back, too?
Why can't we go in there?
Hey, Bobby -- wanna go to the Bronze with us tonight?
Sorry, Lance.
(singing) "One of these things/ Doesn't belong here..."
Bobby -- let's play Psychic Hotline. You try to guess why we're talking to you.
Shouldn't you be hovering over a football stadium with a "GOODYEAR" written on you?
This tables munches.
--Home to dinner.
We felt kinda bummed about last night at the Bronze.
The kinda guy who could hang with us. So we took a vote, 5-1 to let you in.
Nah. Kyle blackballed you.
Underneath, I think you're kinda cute.
He's just testing you -  see what you're made of.
