Hey, Lance -- you look uncomfortable. Join us.
(friendly) You know, Lance, for lunch, I'm thinking pepperoni pizza. You like greasy food, Lance?
(laughing) C'mon Lance, let's check 'em out.
Nice hat.
Pretty fun, huh Lance? (mocking) I hope they don't call our names --
Hy-eeena -- I'm Kyyyyle...
What's wrong, Laaaance -- they just want to learn your name.
(friendly) Yeah, get there early and save us the table by the stage.
Lance, look around. There's us -  then there's you.
Oh yea -- see? It's the telephone pole with acne.
Us? You hang with us?
(no big deal) We'll check out the view.
And one little piggy cried "wee wee wee" all the way -
MMmmmm -- en-er-gy food!
(shrugging) Hey, it's not personal. I just think you gotta drop some poundage.
But how's he gonna lose the weight?
You know, Rhonda's right -- that's how Coach tests  people. You make that run today, Bob-by.
Tif-fanyyy... Tif-fanyyy...
