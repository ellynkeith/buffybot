. . . medically prescribed lunch, my doctor ships it daily, I'll only be here as long as I can hold my breath . . .

I think I lost like seven and a half ounces -- way swifter than the so-called diet that quack put me on -- (off counselor's <u>unseen</u> look) -- oh, I'm not saying we should kill a teacher everyday just so I can lose weight, I'm just saying when tragedy strikes we have to look on the bright side -- you know, like how even a used Mercedes still has leather seats.
