Why pay more for the brand name?
And you can't tell Dr. Gregory what really happened at your old school?
Yeah, he probably gets that excuse all the time.
(clutching Xander tighter) We'll show him.
That must be Angel. I think.
That's him, I'll bet you.
You think he's buff?
I don't think she even likes him . . .
He's one of the only teachers who doesn't think Buffy is a felon.
What's wrong.
Call me old fashioned, I don't want any more surprises in my hot dogs . . .
Well, he <u>is</u> young.
Who would want to hurt Dr. Gregory?
Well, we're gonna find out who did this. We'll find them and we'll stop them.
Good point. I <u>didn't</u> want to hear that.
Wow, I've heard of eating disorders, but . . .
Ouch.
Inquiring minds want to know.
Well, Miss French is sort of big. For a bug.
It's the shoulder pads.
(re: computer) Buffy, nine one one. Blayne's mom called the school, he never came  home last night.
Yeah. If Miss French is responsible for . . . Xander's supposed to be helping her right now . . . he's got a crush on a giant insect!
What are we looking for?
Of course -- -- entirely.
(at computer) Got it. (Buffy joins her) Coroner's autopsy, complete with . . . (turning away) . . . yuck, color pictures.
Okay, this I do not like . . .
(losing it) No, no see, Xander is, I really like his head, that's where you find his eyes and hair, his adorable smile . . .
-- going to die!
Xander's not home -- he told his mom he had to go to his teacher's house and work on a science project. He didn't tell her where.
Getting her address . . .
According to Miss French's personnel records, she was born in nineteen oh seven -- she's like ninety years old.
What do you do now?
I'm gonna start banging on doors.
We have to do something!
Come on Buffy . . .
Buffy!
And dissected.
(to Xander) I'm really glad you're okay. It's so unfair how she only went after virgins . . .
I mean here you guys are, doing the right thing -- <u>the smart thing</u> --  when a lot of other boys your age --
I don't think it's bad at all. I think it's really --
(big step back) -- sweet. But certainly nothing I'll ever bring up again --
